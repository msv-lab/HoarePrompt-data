The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution does not change any variable values or enter a loop. The `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, and `x` is the first element of the list `s`.

Output State: **`done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`.**
