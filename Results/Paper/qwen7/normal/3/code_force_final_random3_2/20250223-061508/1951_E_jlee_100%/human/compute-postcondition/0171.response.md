Given the initial state and the print statement:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `done` is True
- `count` is 2
- `count2` is 0
- The condition `s[2] != s[n - 3]` is not relevant for the print statement as it does not affect the slicing of the string `s`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

This will print the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the index `j` (which is 2), followed by a space, and then the substring of `string` starting from index `j` (which is 2) to the end.

So, the output will be:
Output: **string[:2] string[2:]**
