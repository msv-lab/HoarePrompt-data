Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. If `x` appears `n-1` times in the list `s`, the loop continues without changing any variable values. Otherwise, `x` does not appear `n-1` times in the list `s`.
