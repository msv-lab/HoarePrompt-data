Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-1` (meaning `i` is one less than `n`).
- `string` is an input string (the actual content of the string is not specified).
- `s` is a list representation of the input string (`string`), so `s` contains characters from `string` as its elements.
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`, which means `x` is the first character of the input string `string`.
- `count` is `j + 1` (the value of `count` depends on the value of `j`, but it is not provided).
- `count2` is either `0` or `1` (its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than `0`.

The print statement is `print(string)`, which will print the entire input string `string`.

Output: **string**
