Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is either not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no other condition specified since there is no else part.
