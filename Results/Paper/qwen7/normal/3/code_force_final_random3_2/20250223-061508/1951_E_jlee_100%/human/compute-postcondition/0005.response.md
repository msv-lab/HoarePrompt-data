Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `done` is False.**

The variable `done` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with `done` set to `False`.
