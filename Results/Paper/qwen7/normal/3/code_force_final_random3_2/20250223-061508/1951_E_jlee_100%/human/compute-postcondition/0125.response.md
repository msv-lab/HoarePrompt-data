Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`, `count` is 1, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged.
