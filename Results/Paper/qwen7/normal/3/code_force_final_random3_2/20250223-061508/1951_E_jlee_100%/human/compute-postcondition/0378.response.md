Output State: **`done` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `done` variable stays `False`, `i` remains `n-1`, `string` stays as the input string, `s` remains as the list representation of the input string, and `n` stays as the length of the list `s`.
