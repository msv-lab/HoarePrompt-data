Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `1`
- `count2` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- If at any point `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is not set to `True`
- The condition `count2 == count` is true

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

From the conditions, we know:
- `count` is `j` and `count` is greater than `1`
- `count2` is `0` and `count2 == count` is true, so `j` must be `1`

Given `j` is `1`, the slice `string[:j - 1]` will be an empty string because `string[:0]` results in an empty string. The slice `string[j - 1:]` will be the entire string `string` since `string[0:]` is the whole string.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'', string**
