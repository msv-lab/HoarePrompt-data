Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `x` is the first character of list `s`, and `done` is False. If the count of `x` in list `s` is equal to \(n - 1\), then either the length of list `s` is odd and the middle element of list `s` is not equal to `x`, or the length of list `s` is even or the middle element of list `s` is equal to `x`.**
