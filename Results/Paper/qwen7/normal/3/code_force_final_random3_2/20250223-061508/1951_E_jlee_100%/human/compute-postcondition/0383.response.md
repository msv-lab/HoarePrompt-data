Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the string).
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list representation of the input string.
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`.

The print statement is `print(string)`. Since `string` is the input string, the print statement will simply output the original input string.

Output: **string**
