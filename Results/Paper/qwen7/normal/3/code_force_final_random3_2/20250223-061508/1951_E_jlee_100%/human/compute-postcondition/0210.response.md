Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to `n-1`
- `done` is `False`
- `count` is `2`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `i` is `t`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values are not explicitly needed for the output. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
