Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`
- `done` is `True`
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is equal to `j`
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is less than `count`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` without any additional variables or values being interpolated into it.

Output: **YES**
