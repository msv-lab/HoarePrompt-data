Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `j`, `n`, and the characters in string `s`. Therefore, the output is `1`.
