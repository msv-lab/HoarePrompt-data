Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `0`, `count2` is `0`, `n` must be greater than `0`, and if at any point `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. If `count2 < count` and `count > 1`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` becomes `True`. If none of these conditions are met, the loop continues with the same conditions.
