Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the input value that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` represents the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set before the loop starts. The loop body is omitted, but the loop itself depends on the value of `t`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
