Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `range(int(input()))`, which means the loop will run based on the user input.
   - There are no explicitly declared variables within the loop body, but the loop itself relies on the input value to determine how many times it will run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop runs based on the user input, the only variable that changes with each iteration is the counter used by the `range` function.
   - The initial state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - After each iteration, the loop counter (which is implicitly managed by the `range` function) will increase by 1.
   - The number of iterations is determined by the user input, which is read at the beginning of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the user input for the next iteration. However, since the problem does not specify the exact values of the inputs or the loop body, we can only state that the loop will continue to read input until the specified number of iterations is reached.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values regardless of the condition in the if statement. The loop will continue to read input for the specified number of iterations.**
