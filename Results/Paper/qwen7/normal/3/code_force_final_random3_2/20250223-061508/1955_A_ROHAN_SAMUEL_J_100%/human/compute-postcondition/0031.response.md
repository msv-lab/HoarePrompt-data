Based on the initial state described:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user during the input.

The `print(a * n)` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Since `n` and `a` are the first and second integer inputs provided by the user, respectively, their values are unknown explicitly but are determined by the user's input.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the second and first integer inputs provided by the user, respectively)**
