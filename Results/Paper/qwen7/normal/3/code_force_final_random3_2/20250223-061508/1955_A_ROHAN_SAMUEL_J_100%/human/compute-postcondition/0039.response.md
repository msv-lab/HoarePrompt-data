Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). It does not explicitly return anything from the function body provided, but it processes each test case based on the given constraints and returns results for each case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific integers, and performs some operations based on these integers without returning a single value from the function itself. Instead, it likely prints or handles results for each test case individually.
