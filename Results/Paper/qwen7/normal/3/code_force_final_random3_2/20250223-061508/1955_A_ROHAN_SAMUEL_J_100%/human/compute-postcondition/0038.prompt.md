Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to twice the value of `a`. If `n` is even and 2 * `a` is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `n` is even and 2 * `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to twice the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values regardless of the condition in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are the first, second, and third integer inputs respectively, and these values are updated to the integers entered by the user during the input. Whether the condition `2 * a < b` is met or not, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
