Reasoning:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The program correctly initializes a loop to handle multiple test cases, reading `t` (the number of test cases) from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Input Parsing**: Inside the loop, it correctly parses the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`. This is also correct.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks whether it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually (`2 * a < b`) or to buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.
   - The logic for this scenario is:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost of buying as many pairs as possible (`n // 2 * b`) and adding the cost of the remaining individual yogurt (`a`).

4. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, the program directly checks if it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually (`2 * a < b`) or to buy all yogurts in pairs.
   - The logic for this scenario is:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs (`n // 2 * b`).

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is correct based on the logic implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
