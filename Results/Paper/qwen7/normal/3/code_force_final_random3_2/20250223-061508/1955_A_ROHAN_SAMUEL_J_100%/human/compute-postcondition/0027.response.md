Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split. Regardless of the condition, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values.**
