Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is as follows:
   - If `n` is odd, it checks whether `2 * a < b`. 
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it uses the promotion for pairs of yogurts and buys one additional yogurt at the regular price, printing `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even, it directly uses the promotion for pairs of yogurts, printing `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`.

4. The conditions and calculations in the program match the problem statement and the provided examples.
5. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the program's implementation.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
