Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split, meaning they are integers obtained from user input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

Here, `n` and `b` are integers, and `//` denotes integer division. The expression `n // 2` means `n` divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. Then, this result is multiplied by `b`.

Given that the exact values of `n` and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(n // 2) * b**
