Output State: **`answer` has one more element which is `array[a[0]]`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `answer` still has one more element which is `array[a[0]]`, `i` is still `i + 1`, and now `a[0]` is incremented by 1.
