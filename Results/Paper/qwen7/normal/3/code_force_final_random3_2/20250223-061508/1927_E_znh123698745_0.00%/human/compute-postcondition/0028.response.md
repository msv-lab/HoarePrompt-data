Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `answer` is a list. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then an element from `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and the element at index 0 in `array` is incremented by 1.
