Output State: **`i` is 2 or 4; `n` must be greater than 2 or 4 respectively; `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` to the list `answer` if `i` is odd, which is the case here since `i` is either 2 or 4 (both are even). The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition for `n` remain unchanged. The `answer` list now includes the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to its previous content.
