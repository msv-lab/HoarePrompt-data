Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If \((-1)^i\) equals -1, then `a[-1]` is decreased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `a[0]` is 2 and `answer` is updated with the element at index `a[0]` from `array`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - The value of `a[-1]`, `a[0]`, and `answer` are determined within the loop body and do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, they remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the loop head.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
