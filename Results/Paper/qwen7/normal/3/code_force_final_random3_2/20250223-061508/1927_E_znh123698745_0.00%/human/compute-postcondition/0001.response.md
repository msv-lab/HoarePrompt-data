Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int**.

This means that the code takes two integers as input from the user, splits them by a space, and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
