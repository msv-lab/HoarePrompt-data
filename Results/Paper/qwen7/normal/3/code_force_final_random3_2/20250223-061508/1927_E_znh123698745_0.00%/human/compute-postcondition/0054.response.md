Output State: **`i` is between 1 and \(n-1\) (inclusive), `answer` has one additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. Here, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. Since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `i` is between 1 and \(n-1\) (inclusive). The value of `a[-1]` is used to index into `array`, and the corresponding element is appended to `answer`. The initial conditions of `i` being within the specified range and `answer` being a list are maintained, with `answer` now containing one more element.
