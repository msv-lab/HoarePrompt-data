Output State: **`i` is \(n-1\), `a` is a list, `array` is a predefined list, `answer` is a list with the last element of `a` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` (the last element of list `a`) from the predefined list `array` to the list `answer`. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged, while `answer` gains a new element.
