Output State: **`i` is 2 (if `i` was 1), `i` is 4 (if `i` was 3), etc., `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a[-1]` is `a[-1] - 1`, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still either 2 (if `i` was 1) or 4 (if `i` was 3), `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, and `answer` still contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it.
