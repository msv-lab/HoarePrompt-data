Postcondition: `i` is 2 (if `i` was 1) or 4 (if `i` was 3), `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a[-1]` is decremented by 1 if `i` was odd, and incremented by 1 if `i` was even, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it if `i` was odd, or the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it if `i` was even.
