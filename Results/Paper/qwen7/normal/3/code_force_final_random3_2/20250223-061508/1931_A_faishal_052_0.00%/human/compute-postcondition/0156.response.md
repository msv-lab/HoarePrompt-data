Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `lex` and constructs a list `arr` based on certain conditions. It then sorts `arr` and prints the first three elements of the sorted list as characters using their corresponding ASCII values adjusted by adding 96. The function does not return any value but prints the output for each test case.**
