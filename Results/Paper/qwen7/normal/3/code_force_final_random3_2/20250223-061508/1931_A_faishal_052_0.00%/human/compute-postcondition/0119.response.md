Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, then `arr` contains the element 26, and if `lex` is less than 52, `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` still contains the element 26.
