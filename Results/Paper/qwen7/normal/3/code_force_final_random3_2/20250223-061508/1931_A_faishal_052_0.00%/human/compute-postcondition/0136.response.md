Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the element `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element `1`; otherwise, `arr` contains the element `26`. Regardless of the initial value of `lex`, after executing the code, `arr` will contain the element `26`. The value of `lex` remains unchanged.
