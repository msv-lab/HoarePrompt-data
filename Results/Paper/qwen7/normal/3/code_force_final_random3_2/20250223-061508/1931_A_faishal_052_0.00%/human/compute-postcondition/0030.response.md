Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1
   - `lex` is between 1 and 51
   - `arr` is [26, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 26]

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than 2.
   - In the current state, `j` is 1, which satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.
   - The other variables (`lex` and `arr`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is between 1 and 51, `arr` is [26, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 26]**
