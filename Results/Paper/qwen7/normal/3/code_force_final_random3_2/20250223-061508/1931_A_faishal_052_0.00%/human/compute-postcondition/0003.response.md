Output State: **`total` is not mentioned, `i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\); `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.**

The code `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `lex`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `cases`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
