Postcondition: `j` is 0, `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` remains an integer greater than or equal to 26.
