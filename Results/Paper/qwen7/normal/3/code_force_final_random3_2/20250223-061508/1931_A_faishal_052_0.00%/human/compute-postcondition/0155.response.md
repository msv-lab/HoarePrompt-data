Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer n where 3 <= n <= 78 for each test case, given that t (a positive integer) is within the range 1 <= t <= 100.**

This means the function `func` does not take any parameters but processes a series of test cases where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it returns an integer `n` which falls within the range of 3 to 78 inclusive.
