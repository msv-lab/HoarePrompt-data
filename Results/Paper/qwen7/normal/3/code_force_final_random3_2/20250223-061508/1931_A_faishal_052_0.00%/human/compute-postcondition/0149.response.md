Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `k` in the range `range(3)`. This means `k` will take values from 0 to 2.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`.
   - `k` is currently 1 (since the loop has already run once).
   - `lex` is an integer.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `k` is in the range `range(3)`, it will take values 0, 1, and 2.
   - After the first iteration (`k = 1`), the next value `k` will take is 2.
   - The state of `arr` and `lex` does not change within the loop itself based on the given information.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer**
