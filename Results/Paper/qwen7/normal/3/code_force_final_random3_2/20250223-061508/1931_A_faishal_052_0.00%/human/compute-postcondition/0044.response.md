Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for k in range(3):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`:**
   - The loop starts with `k` being 0 because `range(3)` generates values from 0 to 2.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `range(3)` will generate values 0, 1, and 2, the loop will definitely execute regardless of the initial value of `k` as long as it starts within the range.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `k` starts at 0, 1, or 2, but since the loop will iterate over these values anyway, we don't need to specifically adjust `k`.
   - However, we should ensure that `lex` and `arr` are consistent with their initial states.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `j` is 2 (unchanged).
   - `lex` is either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26 (unchanged).
   - `arr` is [1, 26, `lex`] (unchanged).

Since the loop will execute regardless of the initial value of `k`, no specific adjustment to `k` is necessary. Therefore, the states of `j`, `lex`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

**State:**
**`j` is 2, `lex` is either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26, `arr` is [1, 26, `lex`]**
