Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is either 0 or 1.
- `lex` is a value between 2 and 27.
- `arr` contains the value 1.
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `j` remains 0.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 52, `j` becomes 1 and `arr` is updated to contain the value 26.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(2):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 1.
- The loop will execute twice, once for `j = 0` and once for `j = 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`):**
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `j` remains 0.
   - `arr` contains the value 1.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`):**
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 52, `j` becomes 1 and `arr` is updated to contain the value 26.
   - Since the loop is now at the second iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `lex` must be between 27 and 52 (inclusive) to update `arr` to 26.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` is 1.
- `lex` must be between 27 and 52 for `arr` to be updated to 26.
- `arr` must be 26 if `lex` is between 27 and 52.

### Final State:
- `j` is 1.
- `lex` must be between 27 and 52.
- `arr` must be 26.

### Answer:
State: **`j` is 1, `lex` must be between 27 and 52, `arr` is 26**
