Output State: **`j` is 2; `arr` is a list containing 26; `lex` is an integer - 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26, but the initial value of `lex` is given as an integer. Since the exact initial value of `lex` was not specified, we represent it as `lex` being an integer reduced by 26. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
