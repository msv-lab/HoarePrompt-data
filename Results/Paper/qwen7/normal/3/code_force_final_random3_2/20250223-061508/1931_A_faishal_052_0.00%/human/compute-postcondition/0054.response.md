Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range function argument `2`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` (as per the `range(2)`), we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 0.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < 2`. Given that `j` starts at 0, the loop will definitely execute twice (for `j = 0` and `j = 1`).

4. **Adjust the state of `arr`**: The state of `arr` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution since the loop does not modify `arr` directly. However, we should note that `arr` remains unchanged during the loop execution.

5. **Adjust the state of `lex`**: The state of `lex` being an input integer does not affect the loop's execution either, as the loop does not use or modify `lex`.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is the initial value of `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**
