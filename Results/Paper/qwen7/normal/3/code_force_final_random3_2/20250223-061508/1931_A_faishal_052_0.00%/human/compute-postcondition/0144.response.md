Output State: **The list `arr` contains sorted elements, starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`.**

Explanation:
- If `lex` is 0, `arr` will initially contain only 26s and then append 0, resulting in `[26, 26, ..., 26, 0]`.
- If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will contain one 1 and the rest 26s, and then append `lex`, resulting in `[1, 26, 26, ..., 26, lex]`.
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain only 1s and then append `lex`, resulting in `[1, 1, ..., 1, lex]`.

After sorting, the list will start with the smallest numbers (1s) followed by 26s, and end with the value of `lex`.
