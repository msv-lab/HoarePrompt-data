Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the value of `lex`. Based on the initial conditions, the value of `lex` remains unchanged, and `arr` now contains the element 26.
