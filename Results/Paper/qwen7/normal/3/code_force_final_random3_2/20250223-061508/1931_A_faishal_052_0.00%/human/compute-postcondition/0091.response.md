Output State: **`j` is 2; `arr` is a list containing an additional element `lex`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since `j` was initially 2 and was not affected by the code, its value remains unchanged. The list `arr` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `lex`.
