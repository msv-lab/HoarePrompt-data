Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `k` is incremented, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `lex`. The values of `arr`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `arr` remains an empty list, `k` is incremented (though the exact value is not specified), and `j` remains 2. The input integer is stored in `lex`.
