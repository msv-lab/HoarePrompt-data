Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is between 1 and 51, `arr` is [26, 1, 26]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is `[26, 1]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or `[26, 26]` otherwise. Since the value of `lex` is not specified to change, we keep the condition as is. After appending `26` to `arr`, the list becomes `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 26. However, since the exact value of `lex` does not affect the final list structure after the append operation, we can represent it generally as `[26, 1, 26]` for the given condition. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
