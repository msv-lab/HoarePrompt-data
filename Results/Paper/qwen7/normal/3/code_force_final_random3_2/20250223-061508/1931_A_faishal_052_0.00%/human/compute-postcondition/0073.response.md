Output State: **`j` is 2; `arr` is a list containing 26; `lex` is an integer - 26.**

The code subtracts 26 from the variable `lex`. Since the initial state of `lex` is given as an integer, after executing the code, `lex` becomes an integer that is 26 less than its original value. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
