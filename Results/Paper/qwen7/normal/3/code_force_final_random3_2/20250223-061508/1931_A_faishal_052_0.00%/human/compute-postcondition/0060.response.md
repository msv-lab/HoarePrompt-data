Output State: **`j` is 0; `arr` is a list containing the element 26; `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than 52.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The initial values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still 0, `arr` now contains the element 26, and `lex` remains an input integer greater than 26 and less than 52.
