Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: m p

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ..., lex].

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified. After all iterations, the value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `k` will be 2 after the last iteration. Since the loop prints characters based on the elements in `arr`, and `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...], it means `arr` contains multiple occurrences of the string "lex". After 3 iterations, the loop has printed the first 3 elements of `arr`, which are all "lex". Therefore, the final state of `arr` remains a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ...].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer.

After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `k` goes from 0 to 2), the final value of `k` will be 2. The list `arr` and the variable `lex` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since the loop body does not modify them.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
