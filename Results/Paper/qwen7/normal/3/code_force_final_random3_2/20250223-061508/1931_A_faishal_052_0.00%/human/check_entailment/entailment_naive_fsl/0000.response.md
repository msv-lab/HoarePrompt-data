Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. 

For example, consider the input `24`. The correct output should be `"aav"`, but the program outputs something else. Let's break down the issue:

- The program initializes an empty list `arr` and reads the encoded value `lex`.
- It then tries to fill `arr` with the smallest possible values that fit the constraints.
- However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It assumes that the first two characters will always be the smallest possible values (1 or 26) and the third character will be whatever remains after subtracting these values from `lex`.

Let's walk through the example `24`:
- The program starts with `lex = 24`.
- In the first iteration (`j = 0`), it checks if `lex <= 26`. Since `24 <= 26`, it appends `1` to `arr` and sets `lex = 24 - 1 = 23`.
- In the second iteration (`j = 1`), it again checks if `lex <= 26`. Since `23 <= 26`, it appends `1` to `arr` and sets `lex = 23 - 1 = 22`.
- Finally, it appends `22` to `arr` and sorts it, resulting in `arr = [1, 1, 22]`.
- Converting these values back to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in `"aaz"` instead of `"aav"`.

To fix this, the program needs to properly handle the distribution of the encoded value across the three characters to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated.
