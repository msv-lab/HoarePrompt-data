Output State: **m p**

Explanation: The loop runs three times, and each iteration prints a character based on the value in `arr` converted from a 1-based index to a 0-based index (hence adding 96). Given `arr` is [1, 26, lex], the first iteration prints `chr(1 + 96)`, which is 'a', the second iteration prints `chr(26 + 96)`, which is 'z', and since we don't know the exact value of `lex`, it will be printed as the third character. However, the problem statement does not change the value of `lex` after the first three iterations, so we can assume `lex` remains as it was initially. Since the loop only depends on the first three elements of `arr`, the output will always be 'a', 'z', and the character corresponding to `lex`. Thus, after all iterations, the output state is "mp", assuming `lex` was such that `chr(lex + 96)` results in 'p'.
