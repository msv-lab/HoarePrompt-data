Output State: **`j` is 0, `lex` is a value between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the value 26**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be a value between 26 and 52 (inclusive of 26 but exclusive of 52). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
