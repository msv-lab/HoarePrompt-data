Output State: **`lex` is 26, `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is initially greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` becomes 26 (since it was originally greater than 26, subtracting 26 from it results in 26). The value of `arr` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
