Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, `answers` is a list with one additional element where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'. This is true whether we continue the loop or iteration or not, as there is no alternative action specified in the else part.
