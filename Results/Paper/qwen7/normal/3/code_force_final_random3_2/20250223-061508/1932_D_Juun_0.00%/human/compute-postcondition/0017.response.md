Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are extracted from `card`, `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `suits[suit]` is now `rank`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `rank` to `suits[suit]`. Since `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` was initially `None`, it is now updated to `rank`. The extraction of `rank` and `suit` from `card` and the condition that `suit` is not equal to `trump` remain unchanged.
