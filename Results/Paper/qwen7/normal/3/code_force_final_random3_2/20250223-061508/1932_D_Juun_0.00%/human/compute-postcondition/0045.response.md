Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `suit` is the key of the first item in `suits`, and the current value of `rank` is None.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used within a loop to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The `suits` dictionary, the key `suit`, and the value of `rank` stay the same as they were before the loop iteration was skipped.
