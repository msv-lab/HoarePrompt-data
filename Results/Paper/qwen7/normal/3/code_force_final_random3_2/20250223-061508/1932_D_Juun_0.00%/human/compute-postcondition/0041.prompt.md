Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from `input()`, and `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rank` and `suit` are extracted from `card`. If the current value of `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` contains the `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `trumps` and `answers` are as follows: if `suit` is equal to `trumps`, then `trumps` is updated to the value of `rank`. In this case, `answers` remains the same. Otherwise, `answers` contains one additional element `' '.join([('hearts', rank), ('diamonds', rank)])` if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None` if it was not `None`. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, it is set to `rank`. `rank` is the first element of `card`, and `suit` is the second element of `card`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` and `answers` may change based on the following conditions:
- If `suit` equals `trump`, then `trumps` now contains the value of `rank` appended to it, and `answers` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` is appended with a string formed by joining `rank` and `suit` in sorted order.
- Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is assigned the value of `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
