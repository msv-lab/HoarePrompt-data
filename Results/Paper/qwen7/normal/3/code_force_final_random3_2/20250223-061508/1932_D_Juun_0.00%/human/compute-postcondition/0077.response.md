The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not empty (`trumps != []`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` is a sorted list of the original trump values and must not be empty. For the loop to be executed one more time, `trumps` must still not be empty.

State: **`suits` is an empty dictionary, `trumps` is a sorted list of the original trump values and must not be empty, and `answers` is a list containing strings formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration executed, and `trumps` must not be empty**
