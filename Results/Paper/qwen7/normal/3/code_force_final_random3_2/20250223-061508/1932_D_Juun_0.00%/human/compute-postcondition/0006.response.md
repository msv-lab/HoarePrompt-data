Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are extracted from `card`, where `card` was a single tuple containing two elements representing a card's rank and suit.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables `rank` and `suit`. Since `card` was a tuple containing two elements (a rank and a suit), these elements are now stored in `rank` and `suit` respectively. The precondition that `input_string` must contain at least one word is not directly related to the code provided, so it remains unchanged.
