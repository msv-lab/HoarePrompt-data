Output State: **`card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` now contains the value of `rank` appended to it; `answers` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. Since `rank` and `suit` are part of the `card`, and `answers` remains unchanged, the updated state includes the new value in `trumps`.
