Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from `input()`, and `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. The values of `trumps`, `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `trumps` is still an empty list, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 16, and the trump suit is still the input value from `input()`. The new variable `answers` is initialized as an empty list.
