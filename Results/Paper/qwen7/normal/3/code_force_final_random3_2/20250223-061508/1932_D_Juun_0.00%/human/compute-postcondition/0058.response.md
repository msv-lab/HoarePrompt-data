Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, `answers` is a list with one additional element where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', and `rank` and `suit` are specific values used to format the string.**

Explanation: The code appends a formatted string to the `answers` list using the values of `rank` and `suit`. The string is formatted as `'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'`. After appending, the length of the `answers` list increases by one. The `trumps` list loses its last element due to the `pop()` method. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged.
