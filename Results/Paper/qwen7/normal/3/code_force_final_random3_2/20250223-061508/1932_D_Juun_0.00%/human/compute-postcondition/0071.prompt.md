Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All cards have been processed, and the final state of the variables is as follows:
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value of the first item in `suits` (associated with key `suit`) is either not `None` or remains unchanged; `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element; `answers` is a list with one additional element where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, `answers` is a list with one additional element where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', and either the rank and suit are specific values used to format the string, or the function returns None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a list with one less element, `answers` is a list with two additional elements where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' and the second last element is the previous last element with the rank and suit appended to it followed by popping the trump from the trumps list and appending it to the string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
