Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t` (which is used as the range limit) and the underscore `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop variable itself is not needed).

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `tmp` retains its initial value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is 0, and `tmp` retains its initial value. However, these values are not directly part of the loop head; they are modified inside the loop body.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0 and it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `tmp` retains its initial value, so it does not need to be adjusted either.
   - The only variable that affects the loop continuation is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` retains its initial value, `t` must be greater than 0**.
