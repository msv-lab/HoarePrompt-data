Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to the last element of the list `a`, `cnt` is an input integer, and `a` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `aa` still contains all elements of the list `a` as a set.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual strings, converts each string back to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `i`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
