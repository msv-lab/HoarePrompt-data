Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. However, since the initial values of `ans` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only say that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
