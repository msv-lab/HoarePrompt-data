### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive identical elements and finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
   - Finally, it prints this minimum count as the answer.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**
     - If all elements are the same, the code correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Case 2: Array is Beautiful but Not All Elements are the Same**
     - The code correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements.
     - This minimum count represents the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The code handles the edge case where all elements are the same correctly.
     - However, the code does not handle the case where the array is not beautiful, which is not required according to the problem statement.
     - The code assumes that the array is always beautiful, as stated in the problem constraints. Therefore, the logic for finding the minimum number of consecutive identical elements is not necessary and may lead to incorrect results if the array is not beautiful.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that the function calculates the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the list `a`. This is not entirely accurate because the code does not actually calculate the minimum length of consecutive occurrences. Instead, it finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements, which is not the same as the minimum length of consecutive occurrences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The code incorrectly assumes that the array is always beautiful and does not handle the case where the array is not beautiful.
