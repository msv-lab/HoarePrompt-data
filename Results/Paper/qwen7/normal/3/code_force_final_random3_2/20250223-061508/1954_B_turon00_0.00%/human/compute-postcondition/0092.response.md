Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `ans`, `cnt` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by the given code, they retain their initial values. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being 2, `n` being `ans`, and `cnt` having been increased by 1.
