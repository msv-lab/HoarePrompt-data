Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is either incremented or reset based on the comparison with `tmp`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the smaller of its current value and the current value of `cnt`. All other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `i_prev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
