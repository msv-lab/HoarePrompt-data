Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This initializes `cnt` to 0 without affecting the values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, or `ans`. Therefore, the list `a` remains unchanged, `i` remains as `i_prev + 1`, `tmp` remains an integer, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, which is now 0.
