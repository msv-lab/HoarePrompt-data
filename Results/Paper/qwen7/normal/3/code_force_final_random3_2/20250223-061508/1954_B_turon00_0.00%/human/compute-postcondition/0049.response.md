Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i` and `a[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
