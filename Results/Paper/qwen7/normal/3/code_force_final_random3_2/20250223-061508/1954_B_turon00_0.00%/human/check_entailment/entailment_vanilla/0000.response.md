### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive identical elements and finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
   - Finally, it prints this minimum count as the answer.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**
     - If all elements are the same, the code correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Case 2: Array is Beautiful but Not All Elements are the Same**
     - The code correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements.
     - This minimum count represents the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The code handles the edge case where all elements are the same correctly.
     - The code does not handle the case where the array is not beautiful, which is not required according to the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, given that the array is initially beautiful.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
