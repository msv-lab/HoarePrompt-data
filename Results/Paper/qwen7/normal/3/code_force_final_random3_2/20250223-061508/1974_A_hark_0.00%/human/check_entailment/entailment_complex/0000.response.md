Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. However, it is not used in the main logic of the program, so it is not directly relevant to the correctness of the overall solution.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's break down the logic:
  - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. Then it adjusts `x` based on `y` and calculates the total number of screens needed.
  - If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2.
  - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15.
  - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.

  The logic in `func_2` seems to be designed to handle different scenarios correctly. However, there is a potential issue with the adjustment of `x` based on `y`. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` might not be necessary and could lead to incorrect results in some cases. Instead, we should focus on placing the 2x2 icons first and then filling the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function correctly processes the input for each test case and calls `func_2` for each test case. It ensures that the input is processed correctly for multiple test cases.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in `func_2` needs to be corrected to ensure that the minimum number of screens is calculated accurately. The current implementation might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the logic in `func_2` should be revised to:
```python
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > 0:
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        remaining_space = 5 * 3 - screens_for_2x2 * 4
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((x + remaining_space) / 15)
        print(screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1)
    else:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

This revised function correctly calculates the number of screens needed by first placing all 2x2 icons and then filling the remaining space with 1x1 icons.
