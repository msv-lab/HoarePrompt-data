### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies issues in the logic of `func_2`. Let's break down the problems and the proposed corrections:

1. **Case with both 1x1 and 2x2 icons:**
   - The original logic incorrectly adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4`, which is incorrect because each 2x2 icon actually occupies 4 cells, not 15.
   - The corrected logic should directly calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons after placing all possible 2x2 icons.

2. **Case with only 2x2 icons:**
   - The original logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to calculate the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit.

3. **Case with only 1x1 icons:**
   - The original logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is incorrect because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, not 15. The corrected logic should calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons directly.

4. **Case with no icons:**
   - The original logic `print(0)` is correct.

The corrected version of `func_2` provided in the original assessment addresses these issues correctly. It calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit, then calculates the remaining space and the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in that space, and finally sums the number of screens needed for both types of icons.

Given the corrected logic, the original assessment is accurate. The program now correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, after the corrections, is now correct.
