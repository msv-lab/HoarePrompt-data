Postcondition: `x` is an input integer and `y` is an input integer. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 and `x` is greater than `y/2 * 15 + y * 4`, then `x` is adjusted according to the formula and `y` is adjusted to `y/2 * 2`. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `y` remains unchanged, otherwise `x` is not greater than 0 or `y` is equal to 0.
