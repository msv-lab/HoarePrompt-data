Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`, which is irrelevant to the main logic but is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function correctly handles different scenarios based on the values of `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the number of screens needed for placing `y` 2x2 icons and adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons (`x`) accordingly.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons and adjusts `x` by subtracting the equivalent number of 1x1 icons that can fit within those screens.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_2()` for each test case.
   - The loop ensures that the number of test cases is processed correctly.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in `func_2()` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the given test cases. The overall structure of the program is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
