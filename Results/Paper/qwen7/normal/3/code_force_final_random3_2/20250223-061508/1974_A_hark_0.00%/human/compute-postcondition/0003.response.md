Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable mentioned here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - Since `t` is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs (as implied by the use of `range(t)`), at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be reduced by 1.

### Conclusion:

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and assuming `t` is decremented by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `t` being reduced by 1 but still greater than 0.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
