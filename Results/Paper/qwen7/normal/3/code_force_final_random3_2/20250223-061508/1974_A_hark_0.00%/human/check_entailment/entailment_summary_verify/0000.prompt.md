You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function processes this input data for each test case without returning any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` does not accurately account for the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the screens.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_2`:

1. **Case with both 1x1 and 2x2 icons:**
   - The calculation `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct for determining how many full 2x2 icons can fit.
   - However, the subsequent logic to adjust `x` and calculate `bxsfory1` is flawed. The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it assumes each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells instead of 4, and the addition of `y * 4` is unnecessary.

2. **Case with only 2x2 icons:**
   - The logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct for this case.

3. **Case with only 1x1 icons:**
   - The logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is incorrect because it assumes each 1x1 icon takes up 15 cells instead of 1.

4. **Case with no icons:**
   - The logic `print(0)` is correct for this case.

To fix the program, we need to correctly calculate the number of screens needed for both types of icons. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit
    num_2x2_screens = math.ceil(y / 2)
    # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_space = 5 * 3 - 4 * num_2x2_screens
    # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
    num_1x1_screens = math.ceil((x + remaining_space) / 15)
    # Total number of screens needed
    total_screens = num_2x2_screens + num_1x1_screens
    print(total_screens)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons according to the problem description.
