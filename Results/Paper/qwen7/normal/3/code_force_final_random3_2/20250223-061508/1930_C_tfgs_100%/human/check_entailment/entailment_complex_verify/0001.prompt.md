You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` will be the original value of `a[i]` plus the sum of `(i + 1)` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element `a[i]` (where `0 ≤ i < n`) will have been incremented by `i + 1` for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the final value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[i]` plus the sum of the series `(1 + 2 + ... + n)`, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. 
    #
    #So, the output state can be described as: Each element in the list `a` is incremented by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers starting from 1.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: All elements in the list `a` are appended to `ans`, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, and `ans` contains all the calculated values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `cnt` times, which is 1 time based on the given information. After the loop executes, `ans` is a list where each element is one less than the previous element, starting from the initial state where `ans` contains all elements from the list `a`. The last element of `ans` will be `a[0] - cnt`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `ans` will be a list where each element is reduced by 1 for every iteration of the loop, starting from the original elements of list `a`. Since the loop runs only once (`cnt` is 1), each element in `ans` will be exactly 1 less than its corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a0-1 a1-1 a2-1 ... an-1-1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case. It first increments each element in the list by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. Then, it creates a new list `ans` by appending elements from the modified list `a` and adjusting the values based on the differences between consecutive elements. Finally, it appends additional elements to `ans` to ensure all elements are decremented by a certain count, and prints the resulting list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to perform operations on an array `a` of length `n` to form a set `S`.
- Each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a_i + i` into `S`, and deleting `a_i` from `a`.
- After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
- We need to sort `S` in decreasing order to form array `b`.
- The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       func_1()
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       n = int(input())
       a = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   Here, `n` is read, and the array `a` is populated with space-separated integers.

3. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   ```python
       for i in range(n):
           a[i] += i + 1
   ```
   This step adds `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This is necessary because we will insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

4. **Creating Set `S` and Counting Elements:**
   ```python
       counter = Counter(a)
       cur = 0
       a = list(set(a))
       a.sort(reverse=True)
   ```
   - `Counter(a)` counts occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - Converting `a` to a set removes duplicates.
   - Sorting `a` in reverse order prepares it for constructing the final array `b`.

5. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   ```python
       cnt = n - len(a)
       ans = []
       for i in range(len(a)):
           if i > 0:
               adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
               for j in range(adv):
                   ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
               cnt -= adv
               cur -= adv
           ans.append(a[i])
           counter[a[i]] -= 1
           cur += counter[a[i]]
       for _ in range(cnt):
           ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
       print(*ans)
   ```
   - `cnt` is the number of additional elements needed to reach `n`.
   - `ans` is constructed by ensuring the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` are filled appropriately.
   - `cur` keeps track of the remaining count of each element in `a`.

### Verification
- The logic for filling the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` seems correct. It ensures that the gaps are filled in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.
- The handling of `cnt` and `cur` ensures that the final array `b` is formed correctly.

### Conclusion
The program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
