Output State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends to the list `ans` a new element which is the last element of `ans` decreased by 1. Since `cnt` is not affected by this operation, its condition remains the same. The value of `ans` is updated with the new element.
