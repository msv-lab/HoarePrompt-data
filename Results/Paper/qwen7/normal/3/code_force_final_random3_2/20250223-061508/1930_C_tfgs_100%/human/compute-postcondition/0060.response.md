Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 1 - 1`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2 - 1`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 2 - 2`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` remains 2, `j` will be 3 (since the loop runs from `j` in range `adv` and `adv` is calculated once before the loop starts), `adv` remains as `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)` (unchanged since it's recalculated only once before the loop), and `ans` will contain the following elements: `a[1] - 2`, `a[2] - 2`, `a[1] - 3`, `a[1] - 3 - 1`.
