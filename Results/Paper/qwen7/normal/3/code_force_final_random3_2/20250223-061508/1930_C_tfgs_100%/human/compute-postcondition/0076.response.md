Output State: `cnt` is 0; `ans` is a list where each element is 1 less than the previous element, starting from the initial value of `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will be 0 because the loop condition `_ in range(cnt)` will no longer be satisfied. The list `ans` will contain values that are derived by decrementing each consecutive element by 1, starting from the initial values in `a`.
