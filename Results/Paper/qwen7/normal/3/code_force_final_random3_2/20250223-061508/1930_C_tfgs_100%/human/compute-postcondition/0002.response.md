Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given this information, the loop can execute if and only if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i` itself. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 1.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
