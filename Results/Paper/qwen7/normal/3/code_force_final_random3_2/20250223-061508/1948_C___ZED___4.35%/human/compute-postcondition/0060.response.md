Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.
   - `b` remains the same as the input string.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` is now 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, the loop can continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains the same (an integer greater than or equal to 4).
   - `b` remains the same as the input string.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `b` remains the same as the input string, and `no_path` remains `False`**.
