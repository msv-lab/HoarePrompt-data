Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `b` is the input string from the user, the second last character of `b` is '>', `no_path` is False.**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `no_path`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
