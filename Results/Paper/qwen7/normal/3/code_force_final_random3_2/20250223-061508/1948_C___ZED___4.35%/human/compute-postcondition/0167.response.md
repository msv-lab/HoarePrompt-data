Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two strings of equal even length, where each string consists only of '<' and '>', and returns either "equal" or "not equal" based on whether the two strings are identical or not.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over each character in the two strings and compares them, returning "equal" if all corresponding characters match, and "not equal" otherwise. However, since the task is to describe the functionality without detailing the operations, the focus remains on the inputs and outputs.
