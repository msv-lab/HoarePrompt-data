You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 for each test case, `b` remains the same as the input string for each test case, and `no_path` remains `False` unless the last second character of `b` is `'>';` in that case, `no_path` becomes `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two strings of equal even length consisting only of '<' and '>'. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of the second string is '>', and if the length of the string is 2 or more. If these conditions are met, it further checks if the characters at specific positions in the strings meet certain criteria. Based on these checks, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`.
   - It then reads two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the last but one character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `'>``, the program prints 'NO'. This check ensures that the robot cannot stay in the last column of the second row without moving to the last column.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES' because the robot is already at the target cell `(2, 1)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes a flag `no_path` to `True`.
   - It checks every other column in the second row starting from the first column (`k = 0, 2, 4, ...`). If any of these arrows are not `'>` (i.e., they point left), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after this loop, it means the robot can move to the last column of the second row.
   - Next, it checks every other column in the first row starting from the second column (`k = 1, 3, 5, ...`). If any of these arrows are not `'>` (i.e., they point left), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, based on the value of `no_path`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases properly. It should process each test case separately, but instead, it processes all test cases in a single loop with a single input reading.

2. **Logic for Reaching the Last Column:**
   - The logic for checking if the robot can reach the last column of the second row is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if b[-2] != '>'` is too restrictive. It only checks the second-to-last column, which might not be sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the last column.

3. **Final Check for Reaching the Target Cell:**
   - The final check for reaching the target cell `(2, n)` is incomplete. The program only checks if the robot can move to the last column of the second row but does not ensure that the robot can actually move from the last column of the second row to the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the last column of the second row
        if b[-2] == '<' or b[-1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move from the last column of the second row to the target cell
        if b[-1] == '>':
            if a[-1] == '>':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```
