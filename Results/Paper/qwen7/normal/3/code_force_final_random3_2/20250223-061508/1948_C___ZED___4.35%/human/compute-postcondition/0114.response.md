Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.
   - `a` is the input string with `b` updated to the new input string.
   - For all `k` in the sequence `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`, the value of `a[k]` is not `'>'` if the last second character of `b` is not `'> '`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The other variables (`b`, `no_path`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input string, `no_path` remains `False`, `a` is the input string with `b` updated to the new input string, and if the last second character of `b` is not `'>',` then for all `k` in the sequence `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`, the value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.**
