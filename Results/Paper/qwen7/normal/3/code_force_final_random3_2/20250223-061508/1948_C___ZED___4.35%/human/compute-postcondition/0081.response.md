Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `no_path` remains `False`, and `k` is equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd.**

Explanation: The loop runs in increments of 2 from 0 to `n-2` (or `n-1` if `n` is odd). For each iteration, if `b[k]` is not '>', `no_path` remains `False`. Since the loop does not change the value of `i` or `n` within its body and only increments `k` by 2 in each iteration, after all iterations, `k` will be `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd. The value of `no_path` remains `False` because none of the conditions in the loop body changed it to `True`.
