Output State: **`no_path` is `False`, `k` is `1`, `n` must be an integer such that `1 < n - 1`, and the current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is set to `False` by the code. The values of `k`, `n`, and the condition about `a[k]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
