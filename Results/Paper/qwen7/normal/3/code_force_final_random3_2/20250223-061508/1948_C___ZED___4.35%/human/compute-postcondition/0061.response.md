Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `b` remains the same as the input string, and `no_path` remains False.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `i`, `b`, and `no_path` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` is now an integer obtained from user input, `b` remains the same as the input string, and `no_path` remains `False`.
