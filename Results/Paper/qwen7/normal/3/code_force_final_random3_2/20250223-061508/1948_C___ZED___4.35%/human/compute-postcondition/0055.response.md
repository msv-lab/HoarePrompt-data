Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `b` remains the same as the input string, and `no_path` remains `False`. This is because if `no_path` is `True`, the `else` part is executed, setting `no_path` to `True`. If `no_path` is `False`, the `if` part is executed, but since `no_path` is already `False`, it remains unchanged.
