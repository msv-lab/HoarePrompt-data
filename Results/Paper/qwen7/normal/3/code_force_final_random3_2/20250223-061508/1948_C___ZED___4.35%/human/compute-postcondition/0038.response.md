Output State: **`k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `no_path` is False.**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `no_path`. The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for the variables.
