Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input string, `no_path` remains `False`, `a` is the input string with `b` updated to the new input string, and if the last second character of `b` is not `'>',` then for all `k` in the sequence `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`, the value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.
