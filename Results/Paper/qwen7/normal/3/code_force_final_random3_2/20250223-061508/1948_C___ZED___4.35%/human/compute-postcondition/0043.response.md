Output: **5**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly given as 5. The other variables (`n` and `a`) have conditions or formulas associated with them, but they do not affect the execution of the `print(k)` statement. Therefore, when the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is 5.
