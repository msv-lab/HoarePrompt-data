Output State: `cnt` is 10, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 4, `x` is `n - 24`, `y` is 25.

To calculate this, we observe the pattern from the given information. The value of `cnt` increases by 3 each time the loop runs (from 1 to 4 to 7). This suggests that `cnt` increases by 3 with each iteration. Given that `i` increments by 1 each time, it will reach 5 after 4 iterations. The value of `x` decreases as `i` increases, following the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)`. For `i` being 5, `x` becomes `n - 24`. Similarly, `y` is calculated as `i * i`, which for `i` being 5 is 25. Therefore, after all iterations, `cnt` will be 10, `i` will be 5, and the conditions for `m` and the formulas for `x` and `y` will hold true.
