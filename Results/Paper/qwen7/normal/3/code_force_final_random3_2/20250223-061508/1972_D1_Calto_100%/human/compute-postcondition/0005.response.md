Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `x` is `n - 1`
   - `y` is 4

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

6. **Other variables**:
   - `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 4**
