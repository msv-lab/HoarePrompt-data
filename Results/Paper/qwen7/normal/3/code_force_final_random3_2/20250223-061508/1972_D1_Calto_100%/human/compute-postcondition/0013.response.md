Output State: `cnt` is 10, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 4, `x` is `n - 24`, `y` is 25.

To understand this, let's break it down:

- Initially, `cnt` starts at -1.
- After the first iteration (`i=2`), `cnt` becomes 1.
- After the second iteration (`i=3`), `cnt` becomes 4.
- After the third iteration (`i=4`), `cnt` becomes 7.

Each iteration increases `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. Given the pattern, we can deduce that each subsequent `i` will increment `cnt` by 3 (since `math.ceil(x / y)` for the next `i` will be 3, and `(x % y == 0)` will be 0 or 1, but the sum will consistently increase by 3).

Continuing this pattern:
- For `i=5`, `x` will be `n - 24` (since `i=4` left `x` as `n - 12`, and `i^2` for `i=5` is 25, so `x` decreases by 12 more), and `y` will be 25. The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 3 to `cnt`.

Thus, `cnt` will be 7 (from the previous state) + 3 = 10 after the fourth iteration. The value of `i` will be 5, and `m` must be at least 4 to allow for 5 iterations.
