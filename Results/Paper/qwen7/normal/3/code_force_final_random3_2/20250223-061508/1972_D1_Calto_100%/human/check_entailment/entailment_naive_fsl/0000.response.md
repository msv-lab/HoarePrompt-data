Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
2. `func_2` seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs but does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
- For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\). Therefore, the expected output is 3.

However, the provided `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs. It appears to be attempting to count pairs based on some other logic that does not match the problem requirements.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, the correctness is **False**.
