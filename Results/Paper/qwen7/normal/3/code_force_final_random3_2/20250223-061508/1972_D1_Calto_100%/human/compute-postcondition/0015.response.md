Output State: **The program returns cnt that is 10**

This is because the code snippet `return cnt` simply returns the value of `cnt`, which was initially set to 10 in the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by the return statement and their values are not needed for the return operation.
