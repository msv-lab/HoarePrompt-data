Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in the main logic of `func_2`.

2. **Main Logic (`func_2`)**: The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not match the problem statement. Specifically:
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The logic for counting valid pairs `(a, b)` is flawed and does not satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.
