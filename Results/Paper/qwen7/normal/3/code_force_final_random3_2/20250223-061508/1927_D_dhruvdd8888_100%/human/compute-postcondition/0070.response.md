Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an updated list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.**

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables `i`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, `nums`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e`. The if condition checks whether `e < N` or `e < l`, but since the postcondition does not specify any changes under these conditions, the overall postcondition remains unchanged.
