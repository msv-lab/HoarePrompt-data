Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes an array of integers and handles a series of queries.
2. During the initial pass through the array, the program identifies segments where the elements are the same and records the start and end indices of these segments along with the element value.
3. For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment and then checks if the segment lies within the query range `[l, r]`.
4. Based on the position of the segment relative to the query range, the program decides whether to print a valid pair of indices or `-1 -1`.

The program logic seems to correctly identify segments of identical elements and handle queries as per the problem statement. However, there are a few points to verify:

- The program assumes that the input is read from `sys.stdin`, which is correct.
- The program uses a list `arr` to store segments of identical elements, which is a good approach.
- The binary search is used to efficiently find the relevant segment for each query.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as expected for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
