Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `arr` is an updated list.
- `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements.
- `l` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.
- `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement simply prints the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
