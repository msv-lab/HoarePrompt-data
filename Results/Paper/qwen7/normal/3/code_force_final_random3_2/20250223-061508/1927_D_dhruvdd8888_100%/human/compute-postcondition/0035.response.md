Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an empty list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index of the list `arr` into `s`, `e`, and `_`. The values of `i`, `arr`, `nums`, `l`, `r`, and `eli` remain unchanged. The values of `s` and `e` are now the start and end values of the tuple at the specified index, respectively. `_` is ignored since it is not used in the subsequent steps.
