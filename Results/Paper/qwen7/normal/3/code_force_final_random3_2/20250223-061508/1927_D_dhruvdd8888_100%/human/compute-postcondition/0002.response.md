Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `N` is an integer input from stdin.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and splits them into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
