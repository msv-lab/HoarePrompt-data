Postcondition: `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `_` is 2, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `s` is assigned the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is assigned the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the assignments and conditions do not change the values of `eli`, `s`, `e`, `_`, `l`, and `r`. The if and else parts essentially handle the same variables and assignments, just under different conditions, but the overall state of these variables does not change.
