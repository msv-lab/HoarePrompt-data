Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an updated list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.**

Explanation: The code extracts the start (`s`) and end (`e`) values from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)`. This means that the values of `s` and `e` are now specifically the start and end values of the tuple at that index, while the other variables remain unchanged.
