Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input; `N` is an integer input from stdin; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is the first element of `nums`.**

In this state, the variable `num` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
