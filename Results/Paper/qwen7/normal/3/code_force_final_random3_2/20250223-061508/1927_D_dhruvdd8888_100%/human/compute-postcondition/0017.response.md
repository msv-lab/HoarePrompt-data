Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` must be at least 0, the value of `nums[i]` is now equal to `num`, `s` is 0, `arr` contains the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num)`**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Initially, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, and `num` is stored in `nums[i]`. So, the new tuple added to `arr` is `(1 + 0, 1, num)`, which simplifies to `(1, 1, num)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains both the original tuple `(1, 0, num)` and the new tuple `(2, 1, num)`.
