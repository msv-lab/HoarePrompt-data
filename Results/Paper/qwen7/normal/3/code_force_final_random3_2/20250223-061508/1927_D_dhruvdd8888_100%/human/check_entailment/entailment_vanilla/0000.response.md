Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that corresponds to the query range `[l, r]`.
   - `arr` is constructed to store segments where the value of the array changes. Each segment is a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

3. **Binary Search and Segment Handling:**
   - The binary search finds the segment in `arr` that starts at or before `l`.
   - Depending on the position of the start and end of this segment relative to `l` and `r`, the program decides whether to return a valid pair of indices or `-1 -1`.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Segment Construction:**
   - The segment array `arr` is built to capture transitions in the array values.
   - This helps in quickly identifying where the array values change.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search to find the relevant segment.
   - It checks if the segment starts after `l` or ends before `r`. If so, it returns `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment starts within the query range but ends outside, it returns the start and the next index.
   - If the segment ends within the query range, it returns the start and the end.

### Testing the Logic

To ensure the logic is correct, let's consider some test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Array: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
- Queries: `[1, 5], [1, 2], [1, 3]`

- For `[1, 5]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 3, 2]`. The answer should be `2 3` because `a_2 ≠ a_3`.
- For `[1, 2]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]`. No valid pair exists, so the answer is `-1 -1`.
- For `[1, 3]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 3, 2]`. The answer should be `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Array: `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
- Queries: `[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 5]`

- For `[1, 2]`: The segment is `[1, 1, 30]` and `[1, 2, 20]`. The answer should be `1 2` because `a_1 ≠ a_2`.
- For `[2, 3]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]`. No valid pair exists, so the answer is `-1 -1`.
- For `[2, 4]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]` and `[3, 4, 10]`. The answer should be `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.
- For `[2, 6]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]` and `[3, 4, 10]` and `[4, 5, 10]` and `[5, 6, 20]`. The answer should be `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.
- For `[3, 5]`: The segment is `[3, 4, 10]` and `[4, 5, 10]`. The answer should be `3 4` because `a_3 ≠ a_4`.

### Conclusion

After testing the logic with multiple test cases, the program correctly identifies pairs of indices for each query. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
