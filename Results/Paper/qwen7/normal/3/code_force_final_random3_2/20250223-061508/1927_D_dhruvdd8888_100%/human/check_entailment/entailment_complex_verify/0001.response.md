### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and flow of the program. Let's break down the key points and validate them using the provided annotations and example test cases.

1. **Segment Construction:**
   - The program constructs the `arr` list to capture transitions in the array values. This ensures that each segment in `arr` represents a contiguous subarray where the value of the array remains constant.
   - For example, given the array `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the `arr` would be constructed as `[(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1)]`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts at or before `l`.
   - It then checks the positions of the start and end of this segment relative to `l` and `r` to determine the valid pair of indices.
   - If the segment starts after `l` or ends before `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment starts within the query range but ends outside, it prints the start and the next index.
   - If the segment ends within the query range, it prints the start and the end.

3. **Testing the Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases and ensures that no invalid pairs are printed.
   - For example, in the first test case `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` with queries `[1, 5], [1, 2], [1, 3]`:
     - Query `[1, 5]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 3, 2]`. The answer is `2 3` because `a_2 ≠ a_3`.
     - Query `[1, 2]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]`. No valid pair exists, so the answer is `-1 -1`.
     - Query `[1, 3]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 3, 2]`. The answer is `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.

   - In the second test case `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]` with queries `[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 5]`:
     - Query `[1, 2]`: The segment is `[1, 1, 30]` and `[1, 2, 20]`. The answer is `1 2` because `a_1 ≠ a_2`.
     - Query `[2, 3]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]`. No valid pair exists, so the answer is `-1 -1`.
     - Query `[2, 4]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]` and `[3, 4, 10]`. The answer is `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.
     - Query `[2, 6]`: The segment is `[1, 2, 20]` and `[2, 3, 20]` and `[3, 4, 10]` and `[4, 5, 10]` and `[5, 6, 20]`. The answer is `1 3` because `a_1 ≠ a_3`.
     - Query `[3, 5]`: The segment is `[3, 4, 10]` and `[4, 5, 10]`. The answer is `3 4` because `a_3 ≠ a_4`.

Given these observations and the detailed breakdown, the program correctly implements the required functionality.
