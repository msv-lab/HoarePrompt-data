Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be at least 0, the value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num', `s` is 0, `arr` contains the tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `N` remains at least 0, the condition that `nums[i]` is not equal to `num` is still valid, and `arr` now contains the tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`, which simplifies to `(1 + 0, 0, num)` or `(1, 0, num)`.
