Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

The code simply reassigns the built-in function `input` to `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of any variables but updates the method used for reading input from standard input. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
