Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` must be at least 0, the value of `nums[i]` is now equal to `num`, `s` is 1, `arr` contains the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num)`**.

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
