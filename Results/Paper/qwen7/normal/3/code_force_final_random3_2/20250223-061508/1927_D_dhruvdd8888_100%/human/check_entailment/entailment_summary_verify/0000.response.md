### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, output \(-1 -1\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1()` processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries.
- It identifies segments within `nums` where consecutive elements are the same.
- For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment and then checks if the segment boundaries are within the query range.
- If the segment is within the query range, it prints a valid pair of indices; otherwise, it prints \(-1 -1\).

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain cases where the segment boundaries are not within the query range. The suggested fix involves ensuring that the segment boundaries are within the query range before considering them as valid.

#### Analysis:
1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same using a loop.
   - These segments are stored in the list `arr`.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment.
   - It then checks if the segment boundaries are within the query range.
   - If the segment is within the query range, it prints a valid pair of indices; otherwise, it prints \(-1 -1\).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the segment starts after the query range or ends before the query range.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the segment starts at the beginning of the query range but ends outside it.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The original assessment suggested a specific fix, but upon closer inspection, the current implementation already includes the necessary checks to ensure that only valid segments within the query range are considered.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary. The original assessment was accurate in identifying a potential issue but the provided fix was unnecessary as the existing code already handles the required cases correctly.
