Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be at least 0, the value of `nums[i]` is now equal to `num`, `s` is 0, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`**.

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` was previously 0, the value of `nums[0]` is now stored in `num`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
