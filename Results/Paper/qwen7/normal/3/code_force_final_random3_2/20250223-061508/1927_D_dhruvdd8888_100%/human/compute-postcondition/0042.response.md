Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an empty list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. If `s` is greater than `r` or equal to 1, then `s` remains unchanged. If `s` is less than or equal to `r`, then `s` remains unchanged.**
