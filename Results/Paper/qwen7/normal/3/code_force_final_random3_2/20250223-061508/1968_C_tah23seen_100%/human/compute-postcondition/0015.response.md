Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` of length `n` where each element is determined by the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from the second last index of `ans` down to the first index. After the calculation, the function returns the list `ans`. The last element of `ans` (`ans[n-1]`) is not defined as there is no corresponding `ans[n]`.**
