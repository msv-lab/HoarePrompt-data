Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array \(a\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). Given the constraints and the provided solution, we need to verify if the logic used in `func_1` correctly generates such an array \(a\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward from \(n-2\) to \(0\) and updates each element of `ans` based on the previous element and the corresponding value in `arr`.
   - Specifically, it sets \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\), which is a direct attempt to satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i+1}\).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The initialization of `ans` with \(10^9\) ensures that each \(a_i\) starts sufficiently large.
   - The backward iteration and updating logic should theoretically work if the initial assumption holds true. However, let's consider the correctness of this approach:
     - If \(a_{i+1} - x_i\) results in a value less than \(a_{i+1}\), it might not always guarantee the correct modulo operation.
     - The logic assumes that \(a_i\) can be derived directly from \(a_{i+1}\) and \(x_i\), but it doesn't ensure that the derived \(a_i\) will satisfy the modulo condition for all preceding elements.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `n = 3`, `arr = [2, 4]`. According to the problem, \(x_2 = 2\) and \(x_3 = 4\).
   - Using the provided logic, `ans[0] = 10^9`, `ans[1] = 10^9 - 2 = 999999998`, and `ans[2] = 999999998 - 4 = 999999994`.
   - However, \(999999994 \bmod 999999998 \neq 4\), so this approach fails to produce a correct solution.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs due to the potential issues with the backward updating logic and the modulo operation.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
