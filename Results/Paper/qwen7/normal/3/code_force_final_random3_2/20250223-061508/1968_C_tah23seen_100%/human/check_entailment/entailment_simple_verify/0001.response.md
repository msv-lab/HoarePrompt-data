### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an array \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
   - The provided solution initializes `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\) and then updates each element based on the previous element and the corresponding value in `arr`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward from \(n-2\) to \(0\) and updates each element of `ans` based on the previous element and the corresponding value in `arr`.
   - Specifically, it sets \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The initialization of `ans` with \(10^9\) ensures that each \(a_i\) starts sufficiently large.
   - The backward iteration and updating logic should theoretically work if the initial assumption holds true. However, let's consider the correctness of this approach:
     - The logic assumes that \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\) will always result in a value that satisfies the modulo condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i+1}\).
     - This assumption is not always correct because \(a_i\) could be smaller than \(a_{i+1}\), leading to incorrect results.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `n = 3`, `arr = [2, 4]`. According to the problem, \(x_2 = 2\) and \(x_3 = 4\).
   - Using the provided logic, `ans[0] = 10^9`, `ans[1] = 10^9 - 2 = 999999998`, and `ans[2] = 999999998 - 4 = 999999994`.
   - However, \(999999994 \bmod 999999998 \neq 4\), so this approach fails to produce a correct solution.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve setting \(a_1\) to a sufficiently large value and then ensuring that each subsequent \(a_i\) is chosen such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
   - One possible correct approach is to set \(a_1\) to a large value and then set \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i\) for each \(i\). This ensures that \(a_i > a_{i-1}\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs due to the potential issues with the backward updating logic and the modulo operation.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs, and the logic used in `func_1` is flawed.
