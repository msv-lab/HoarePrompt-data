Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the calculation of `ans[i]` is incorrect. The requirement is that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), but the current implementation sets \( a_i \) to \( a_{i+1} - x_i \). This does not satisfy the modulo condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that each \( a_i \) is chosen such that the modulo condition holds. A correct approach would be to set \( a_i \) to a value that is greater than or equal to \( a_{i-1} \) and satisfies the modulo condition. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [1] * n
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] // arr[i] * arr[i] + arr[i]
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `ans` with 1 for all elements.
2. **Backward Calculation**: Starting from \( a_{n-1} \) to \( a_2 \), we calculate each \( a_i \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \). This is done by setting \( a_i \) to the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition, which is \( a_{i+1} // x_i * x_i + x_i \).

This ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied for each \( x_i \).
