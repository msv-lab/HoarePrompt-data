Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**
