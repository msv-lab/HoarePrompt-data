Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.

In this final state after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from `n-1` down to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop. The variable `possible` is set to `True` if any condition within the loop breaks the execution (either due to `c[i]` not being equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` being equal to `b[i]`). Since the loop has completed all its iterations without finding a case where `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `possible` remains `True`. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and the variable `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.
