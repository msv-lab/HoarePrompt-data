Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` equals either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
