Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`
   - `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace
   - `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace
   - `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace
   - The elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values
   - `t` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Key Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This variable will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `n`: This variable does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop cannot execute anymore because `i` will exceed `n` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` to proceed to the next iteration since it will not happen.
   - `n` remains unchanged as per the loop condition.
   - `possible` remains as it was because the loop condition does not affect its value directly.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `t` remains greater than 0 as there is no indication that it would change within the loop.

Given this analysis, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop cannot execute anymore due to the condition `i == n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
