Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

The code `possible = True` does not change any of the existing values or conditions. It simply reassigns the variable `possible` to the boolean value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
