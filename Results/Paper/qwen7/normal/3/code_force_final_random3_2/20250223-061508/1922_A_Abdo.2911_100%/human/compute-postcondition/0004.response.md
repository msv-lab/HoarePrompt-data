Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.
