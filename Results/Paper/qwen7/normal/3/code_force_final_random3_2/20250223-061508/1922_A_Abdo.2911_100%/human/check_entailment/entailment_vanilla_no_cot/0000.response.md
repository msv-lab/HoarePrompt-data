Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Logic for Matching Conditions**: The program checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). However, this logic alone is not sufficient to determine if a template exists where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

2. **Template Construction**: The program should construct a template character by character based on the conditions that need to be satisfied. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different, then the template character at position `i` should be set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template character should be set to `a[i]` or `b[i]` (whichever is not equal to `c[i]`).

3. **Final Check**: After constructing the template, the program should verify if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not. This involves checking each character against the constructed template.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Construct the template
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    template.append(a[i].upper())
                else:
                    template.append(a[i])
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    template.append(b[i])
                elif c[i] == b[i]:
                    template.append(a[i])
                else:
                    template.append(a[i] if a[i] != c[i] else b[i])
        
        # Verify the template
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != template[i].lower() or b[i] != template[i].lower() or c[i] == template[i].lower():
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected version constructs the template correctly and verifies it properly, ensuring that the conditions for matching and non-matching are met.
