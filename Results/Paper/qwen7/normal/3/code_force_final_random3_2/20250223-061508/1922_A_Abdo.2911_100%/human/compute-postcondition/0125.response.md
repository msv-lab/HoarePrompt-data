Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
