Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[n]` is equal to `a[n]` or `b[n]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
