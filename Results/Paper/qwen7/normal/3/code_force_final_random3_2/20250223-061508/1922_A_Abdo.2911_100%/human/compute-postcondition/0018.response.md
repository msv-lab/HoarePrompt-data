Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal. The current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b`, and the value of `c[i]` remain unchanged.
