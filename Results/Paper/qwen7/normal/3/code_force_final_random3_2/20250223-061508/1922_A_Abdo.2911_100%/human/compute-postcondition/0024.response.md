Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal. If `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the condition remains unchanged. If `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
