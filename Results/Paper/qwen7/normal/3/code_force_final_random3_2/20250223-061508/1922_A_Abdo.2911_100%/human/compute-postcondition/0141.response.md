Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `possible` to `True`. This changes the value of `possible` from its previous condition based on the values of `c[n-1]`, `a[n-1]`, and `b[n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
