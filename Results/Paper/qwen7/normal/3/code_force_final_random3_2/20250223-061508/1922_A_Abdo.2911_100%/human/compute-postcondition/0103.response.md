Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. If `c[i]` equals `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we continue the loop. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
