Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` remains the same, the values of `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` reads an input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
