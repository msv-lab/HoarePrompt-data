Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. It does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
