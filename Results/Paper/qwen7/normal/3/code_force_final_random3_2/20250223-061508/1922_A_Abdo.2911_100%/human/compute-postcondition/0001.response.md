State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is now 0** 

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is determined by user input, and it must be within the range of 1 to 1000 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is a common placeholder used in Python for loop indices when the index itself is not needed. It starts at 0 before the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is within the specified range, and setting `_` to 0.
