Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `c` is the stripped input string from user.**

The code `c = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
