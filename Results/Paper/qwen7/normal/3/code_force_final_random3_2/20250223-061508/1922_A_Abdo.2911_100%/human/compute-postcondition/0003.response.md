Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user**.

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable `a`. The input is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip()` method. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
