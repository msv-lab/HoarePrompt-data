Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `c` is the stripped input string from user, `possible` is `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[0]` must also be equal to `a[0]` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0. If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[1]` must also be equal to `a[1]` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 0. If `c[2]` equals `a[2]` or `c[2]` equals `b[2]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
