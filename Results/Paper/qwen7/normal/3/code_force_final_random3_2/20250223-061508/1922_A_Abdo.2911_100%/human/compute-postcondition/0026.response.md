Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[0]` must also be equal to `a[0]` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`.
