Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1`, the loop will execute if `n-1 < n`, which is always true. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` because the loop will always start with `i` being `n-1` and will decrement until it reaches a value where `i < n` is no longer true.
   - The variable `n` should be checked to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `possible`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain as they are.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0**.
