Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0. After all iterations of the loop, `possible` is `True` if there exists at least one index `j` (where `0 <= j < n`) such that `c[j]` is neither equal to `a[j]` nor `b[j]` and `c[j]` is not equal to either `a[j]` or `b[j]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`. The loop terminates when it finds such an index `j` or completes all iterations without finding any, setting `possible` to `True` if necessary.
