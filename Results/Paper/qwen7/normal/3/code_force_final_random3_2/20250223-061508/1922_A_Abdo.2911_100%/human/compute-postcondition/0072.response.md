Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
