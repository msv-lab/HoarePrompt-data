Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 30.
- `length` is greater than 30.
- `s[0]` is '0' or '1'.
- `s[1]` to `s[29]` are all '1'.
- `s[30]` is '1' if `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1' during the last iteration, otherwise `s[30]` remains '1'.

Given these conditions, let's break down the values of the relevant parts of `s`:

- `s[0]` could be either '0' or '1', but since no specific value is given, we'll consider the general case where it is '1' (as it is more common in binary strings).
- `s[1]` to `s[29]` are all '1'.
- `s[30]` is determined by the conditions mentioned. Since the exact previous values (`s[29]` and `s[28]`) are not specified, we assume the default condition where `s[30]` remains '1'.

Therefore, the string `s` would look like this: `'11111111111111111111111111111111111'`.

When the `print(*s)` statement is executed, it will print the string `s` with each character separated by a space.

Output: **1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1**
