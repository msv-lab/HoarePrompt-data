Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0', with an additional element '1' appended to it.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Since `s` initially contains either `'1'` or `'0'`, after appending `'1'`, `s` will contain these elements plus the newly added `'1'`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
