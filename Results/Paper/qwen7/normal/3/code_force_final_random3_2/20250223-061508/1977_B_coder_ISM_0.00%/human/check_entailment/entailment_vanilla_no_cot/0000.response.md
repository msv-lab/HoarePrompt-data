Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `s` List**: The list `s` is initialized with 30 elements, but the problem allows for the length of the array to be between 1 and 32. This means that for numbers less than \(2^{29}\), the list will have unnecessary zeros at the beginning.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: The logic for ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Specifically, the part where it tries to convert `-1` to `0` and vice versa when they are adjacent is overly complex and does not always produce a valid sequence.

3. **Output Length Calculation**: The length calculation and handling of the list `s` are not correctly aligned with the problem requirements. The length should be determined dynamically based on the actual number of non-zero elements in the sequence.

### Correct Approach:
A simpler and more direct approach would be to use the binary representation of the number `x` and then adjust the sequence to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        # Convert x to its binary representation and pad with leading zeros
        binary_rep = bin(x)[2:].zfill(30)
        # Reverse the binary representation to match the required format
        binary_rep = binary_rep[::-1]
        
        # Create the array a
        a = []
        for bit in binary_rep:
            if bit == '1':
                a.append(1)
            elif bit == '0':
                a.append(0)
            else:
                a.append(-1)
        
        # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] != 0 and a[i + 1] != 0:
                if a[i] == 1 and a[i + 1] == 1:
                    a[i + 1] = 0
                elif a[i] == -1 and a[i + 1] == -1:
                    a[i] = 0
        
        # Determine the length of the array
        length = len([i for i in a if i != 0])
        
        # Output the length and the array
        print(length)
        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

func()
```

This approach ensures that the binary representation of `x` is correctly converted to the required format and that the condition of no two consecutive non-zero elements is met.
