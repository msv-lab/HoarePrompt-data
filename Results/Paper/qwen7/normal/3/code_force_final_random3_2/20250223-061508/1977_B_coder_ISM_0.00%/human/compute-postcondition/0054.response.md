Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '1', and `s[1]` is changed to '0'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[i]` to '0'. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `s[1]` is changed from '1' to '0'. The values of `i`, `flag`, and `s[0]` remain unchanged.
