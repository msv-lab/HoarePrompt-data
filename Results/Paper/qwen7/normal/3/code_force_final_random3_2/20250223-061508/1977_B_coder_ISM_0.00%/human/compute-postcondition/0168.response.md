Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i + 1]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. The values of `i`, `n`, `flag`, and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
