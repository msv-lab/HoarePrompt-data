The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \(x\). For each \(x\), it converts \(x\) into a 30-bit binary representation, modifies this binary representation according to specific rules, and then prints the modified binary string along with its length. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is that it outputs the modified binary strings and their lengths for each test case.
