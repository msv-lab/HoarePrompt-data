Postcondition: `i` is 29, `nalla` is 31, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[29]` is '1', and `s[30]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`. If `flag` is true and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[30]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `flag` becomes 1, `s[29]` becomes '0', `s[30]` becomes '1', and `s[31]` becomes '1'.
