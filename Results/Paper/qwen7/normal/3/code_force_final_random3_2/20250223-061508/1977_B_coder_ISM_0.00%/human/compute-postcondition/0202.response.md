Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` must be greater than 1
   - `s` remains unchanged

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `length`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so `length` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `length` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `length` must be greater than 2
   - `s` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 2, and `s` remains unchanged**
