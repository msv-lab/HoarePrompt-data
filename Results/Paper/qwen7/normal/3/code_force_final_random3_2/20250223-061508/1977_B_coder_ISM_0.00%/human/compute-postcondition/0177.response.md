Output State: `i` is 29, `nalla` is 31, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = 28`), the variable `i` will be 29. The variable `nalla` remains unchanged at 31. The variable `flag` can either be 0 or 1 depending on the state it was left in during the last iteration of the loop. The value of `s[29]` is explicitly set to '0' in the loop, and `s[30]` retains its value from the last iteration, which is determined by the value of `flag`.
