Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '0', and `s[i + 1]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '0'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `flag`, and the value of `s[i + 1]`) remain unchanged.
