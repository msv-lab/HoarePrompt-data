Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 28.
   - `length` is greater than 28.
   - If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` remains '0'. Otherwise, the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < length`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was 28 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `29`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < length`.
   - Since `length` is greater than 28, `i = 29` is still within the bounds of the loop.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 29.
   - `length` remains the same and is still greater than 29.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 29, `length` is greater than 29**.
