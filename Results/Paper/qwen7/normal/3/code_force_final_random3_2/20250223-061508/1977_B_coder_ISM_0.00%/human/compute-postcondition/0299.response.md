Output State: **`i` is 30; `s`[29] is '-1'; `length` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[29]` (since `i` is 30 and `i - 1` equals 29) to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `length` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
