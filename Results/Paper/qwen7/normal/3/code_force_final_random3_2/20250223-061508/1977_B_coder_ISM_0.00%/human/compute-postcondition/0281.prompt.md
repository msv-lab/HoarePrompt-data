Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `flag` is 0, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, and `nalla` is 31.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `flag` is 1, `i` is between 0 and 28 (inclusive), `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains '0'. `nalla` is 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `flag` is 0, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, `nalla` is 31. If `flag` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `s` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and the element at index `i` in list `s` is changed to '0'. If `flag` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `s` is '1' and equals the element at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to 0 and the element at index `i` in list `s` is changed to '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `length`, `s`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `flag` is 0, `i` is less than 28, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, `nalla` is 31. If `flag` is 0 and the element at index `i` in list `s` is equal to the element at index `i + 1` and both are '1', then no changes are made. If `flag` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `s` is '0', the element at index `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the element at index `i` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
