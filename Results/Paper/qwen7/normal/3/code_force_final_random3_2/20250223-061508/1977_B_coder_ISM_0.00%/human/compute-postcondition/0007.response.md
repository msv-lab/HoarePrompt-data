Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '1', `i` is 0.**

The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The other variables (`t`, `nalla`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
