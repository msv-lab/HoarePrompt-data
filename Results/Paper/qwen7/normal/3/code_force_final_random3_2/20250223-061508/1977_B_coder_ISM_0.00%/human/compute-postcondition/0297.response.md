Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `range(1, length)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 29
   - `length` must be greater than 1
   - If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', the function does not change the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 29, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 30.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

5. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The post-condition for the next iteration should ensure that the loop can continue executing based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 30, `length` must be greater than 1**
