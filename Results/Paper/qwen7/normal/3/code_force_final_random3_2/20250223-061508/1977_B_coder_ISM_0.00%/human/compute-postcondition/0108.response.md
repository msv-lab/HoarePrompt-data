Output State: **`i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is an empty list, `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '1', ..., `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1' if `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1' during the last iteration, otherwise `s[30]` remains '1', `nalla` is 31, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `length` to 30. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `s[30]` depends on the conditions mentioned, but since those conditions are not met (as `length` is now 30), `s[30]` remains '1'.
