Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 30.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is an integer and `i` is less than 30.
   - `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was less than 30 before, it will still be less than 30 after incrementing, unless it reaches 30 exactly.
   - If `i` was 29 before, after incrementing, `i` will be 30, and the loop will terminate.

Given the above points, let's adjust the state:

- If `i` was less than 29, after incrementing, `i` will still be less than 30.
- If `i` was 29, after incrementing, `i` will be 30, and the loop will terminate.

Since we need to consider the state just before the loop terminates, we assume `i` was 29 in the previous iteration (as it would be the last possible value before the loop terminates).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 30, and the loop will terminate.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'**.
