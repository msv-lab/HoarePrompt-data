Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, length)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 29.
   - `length` is greater than 29.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < length`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 29 and `length` is greater than 29, the loop will continue if `i` is incremented to 30 (i.e., `i + 1`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1, `i` will become 30.
   - `length` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body and its value is only checked, not changed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 30, `length` is greater than 29**
