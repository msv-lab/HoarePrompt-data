Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '1', and `s[1]` is changed to '-1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` to '-1'. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `s[1]` is updated from '1' to '-1'. The values of `i`, `flag`, and `s[0]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
