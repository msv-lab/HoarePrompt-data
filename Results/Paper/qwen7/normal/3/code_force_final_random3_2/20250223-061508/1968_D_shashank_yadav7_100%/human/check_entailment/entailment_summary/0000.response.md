Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. For each test case, it correctly initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, adjusts them to zero-based indices, and initializes the scores.
3. The program then enters a loop that simulates the game for `k` turns. In each iteration:
   - It updates the positions of both players using the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the maximum possible scores (`bm` for Bodya and `sm` for Sasha) considering the remaining turns.
   - It also accumulates the scores by adding the value at the current position to the respective player's score.
4. After the loop, it compares the maximum possible scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the rules of the game correctly and should produce the expected results based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
