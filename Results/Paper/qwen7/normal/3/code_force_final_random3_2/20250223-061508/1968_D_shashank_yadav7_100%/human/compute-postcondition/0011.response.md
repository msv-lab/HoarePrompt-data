Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` will start at 0 (the default value for the `range` function).
   - `n` is an integer from the input.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start executing.
   - `i` will start at 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
