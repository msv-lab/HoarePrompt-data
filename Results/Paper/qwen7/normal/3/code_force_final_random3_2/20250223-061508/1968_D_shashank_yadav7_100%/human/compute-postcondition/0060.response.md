Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is `input integer - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is decremented by 1. Initially, `s` was set to `input integer - 1`. After decrementing `s` by 1, `s` becomes `input integer - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `input integer - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
