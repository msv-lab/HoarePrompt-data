Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Since `sp` was previously increased by `a[s]`, it is now increased by `a[s]` again. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
