Output State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`; `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial state where `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[s] * 0 + sp`, which is just `sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `sp`. The other variables (`bm`, `n`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
