Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `k` is 0
   - `bm` is max(`bm`, `a[b] * 0 + bp`)
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1`
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`)
   - `sp` is `a[s] * k + sp`
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (assuming it was 0 in the previous iteration).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

The other variables (`k`, `bm`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
