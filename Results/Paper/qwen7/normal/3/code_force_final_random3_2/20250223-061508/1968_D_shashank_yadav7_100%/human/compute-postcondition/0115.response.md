Output State: **`p` is a list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is now `p[s] - 2`, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is now `a[s]`, `bp` is now `a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `a` is now a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `bp = a[b]` assigns the value of `a[b]` to `bp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
