Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains the maximum value it achieved during any iteration, and if `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, then `sm` remains the maximum value it achieved during any iteration.**
