Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `sp`. Since `sp` is a variable, its exact value is not specified, so `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `sp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
