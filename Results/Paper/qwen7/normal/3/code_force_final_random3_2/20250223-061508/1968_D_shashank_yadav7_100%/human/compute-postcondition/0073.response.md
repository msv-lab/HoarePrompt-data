Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial conditions, `k` is 0 and `s` is `p[s] - 1`, so the expression simplifies to `a[p[s] - 1] * 0 + sp`, which further simplifies to `sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `sp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
