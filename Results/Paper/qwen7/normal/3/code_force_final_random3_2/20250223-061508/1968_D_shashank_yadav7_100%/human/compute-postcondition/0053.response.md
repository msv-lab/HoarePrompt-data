Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times, `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, and `bm` equals `sm`**.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains equal to `n`, `k` remains 0, `b` and `s` maintain their initial patterns, `bm` and `sm` are updated as the maximum values considering the current `k`, `bp` and `sp` remain the sums of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, and ultimately `bm` equals `sm`.
