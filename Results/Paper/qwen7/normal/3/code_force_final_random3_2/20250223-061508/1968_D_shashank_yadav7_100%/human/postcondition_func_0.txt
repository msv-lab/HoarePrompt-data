The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers. For each test case, it calculates two values, \( bm \) and \( sm \), which represent the maximum possible sums obtained by applying a specific operation involving elements of \( a \) and \( k \). After processing all test cases, it prints 'Bodya' if \( bm \) is greater than \( sm \), 'Sasha' if \( bm \) is less than \( sm \), and 'Draw' if they are equal.
