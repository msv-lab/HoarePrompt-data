Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `bm` is max(`bm`, `a[b] * 0 + bp`), `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`).**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[s] * 0 + sp`, which is just `sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `sp`. The values of `n`, `k`, `bm`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
