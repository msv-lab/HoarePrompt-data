Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `bm` is max(`bm`, `a[b] * 0 + bp`), `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates `bm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[b] * 0 + bp`, which further simplifies to `bp`. Since `k` is 0, the value of `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `bp`. The values of `n`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
