Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `k` is 0
- `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times, meaning `b` is a list where each element is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times, meaning `s` is a list where each element is `p[s] - 1`
- `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration
- `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration
- `bm` is less than `sm`

The print statement is:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
