Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `b`, `s` from the input using `input().split()`. These values replace the previous values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial values of `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within this snippet. Therefore, `i` is replaced by `n`, and `k`, `b`, and `s` are updated to the input values.
