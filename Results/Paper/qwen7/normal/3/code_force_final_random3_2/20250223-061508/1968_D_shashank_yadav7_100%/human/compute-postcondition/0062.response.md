Output State: **`k` is 1, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is `input integer - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[b]` to `bp`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `bp` is updated to be the current value of `a[b]`.
