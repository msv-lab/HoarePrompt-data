Output State: **`n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of these integers**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `p`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were part of the input before the code was executed.
