Based on the initial state provided:

- `ops` is an empty list.
- `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order.
- `p2` contains all the elements that were appended during the iterations in reverse order of their appearance.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

Let's break it down:

1. `p1[::-1]` reverses the order of elements in `p1`.
2. `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
3. `map(str, ...)` converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
4. `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with spaces.

Given that `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order and `p2` contains the elements appended during iterations in reverse order, the final output will be a string where the elements of `vx` are reversed and then followed by the elements of `p2` in their original order, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [reversed vx] [p2]**
