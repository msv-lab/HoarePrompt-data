Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` has at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is also equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and if `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2 <= 0`, `v3` is assigned the value of `q(0)` and `v3` is now in `ops`.
