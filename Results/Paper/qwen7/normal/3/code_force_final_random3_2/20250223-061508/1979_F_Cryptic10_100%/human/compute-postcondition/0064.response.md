Postcondition: **`ops` is a list containing either the tuple `(v1, v2)` or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, depending on whether `v2` is greater than 0. `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, and `vx` has had its second last element removed. If `v2` is greater than 0, `v3` is not defined; otherwise, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, and the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` is discarded.**
