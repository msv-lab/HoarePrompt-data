Output State: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both of which are integers from 1 to `t-2`, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, and the length of `ops` is equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed. The values of `v1` and `v2` (or `v3`) in each tuple correspond to the values returned by the function `q` during each iteration, and the structure of `ops` reflects the sequence of operations performed by the loop until `vx` contains only 2 elements.
