Output State: **After all iterations, `ops` will be an empty list, `p1` will contain the elements of `vx` in their original order, and `p2` will contain all the elements that were appended during the iterations in reverse order of their appearance.**

Explanation:
- `ops` remains unchanged throughout the loop and stays as an empty list since no operations are performed on it within the loop.
- `p1` will contain the elements of `vx` in their original order because `vx` is updated by removing elements but not modified directly in the loop.
- `p2` will accumulate all the elements that were appended during the iterations in reverse order of their appearance. This means that every time an element is added to `p2` based on the conditions inside the loop, it gets added to the end of `p2`, thus preserving the reverse order of appearance. The final `p2` will include all the elements that were appended throughout the iterations, starting from the original elements and ending with the most recent ones.
