Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` with one element removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(ops)` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` adds a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `v1` and `v2` are already defined as integers from the set `vx` and `v1 != v2`, the only change is that the length of `ops` increases by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
