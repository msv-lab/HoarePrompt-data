Output State: **`vx` has one less element than before, `v2` is now the new last element of `vx`, `v3` is removed from `vx`.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v3)` removes the element `v3` from the list `vx`. Given the initial state, `v3` is the first element returned by the function `q(0)`, and `v2` is the new last element of `vx` after `v1` was removed. After executing the code, `v3` is removed from `vx`, and `v2` remains as the new last element of `vx`.
