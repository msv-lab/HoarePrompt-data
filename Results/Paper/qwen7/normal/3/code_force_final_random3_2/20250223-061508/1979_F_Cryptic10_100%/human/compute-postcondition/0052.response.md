Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`.**

Explanation: The code `v3, _ = q(0)` calls the function `q` with the argument `0` and assigns the first return value to `v3` while ignoring the second return value (indicated by `_`). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since the value of `v2` was specified to be less than or equal to 0, it remains unchanged.
