Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 6`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `len(vx)` is decreased by 1, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `_` is the discarded return value of `q(0)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the list `ops` by adding two tuples. The first tuple `(v3, 0)` adds the value of `v3` (which is the return value of `q(0)`) to `ops` with the second element being 0. The second tuple `(v1, 0)` adds the value of `v1` (which is `len(vx) - 5`) to `ops` with the second element also being 0. The values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to reflect the new length of `vx` after it has been reduced by one element. The other variables remain unchanged.
