Output State: **`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; the last tuple in `ops` has its first element appended with `v1`.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `p2` (which is the same as the last tuple `p1` in this case) is used; otherwise, `p1` is used. In both cases, `v1` is appended to the first element of the selected tuple. Since `p1` refers to the last tuple in `ops`, appending `v1` to the first element of `p1` modifies the last tuple in `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged as they are referenced from the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
