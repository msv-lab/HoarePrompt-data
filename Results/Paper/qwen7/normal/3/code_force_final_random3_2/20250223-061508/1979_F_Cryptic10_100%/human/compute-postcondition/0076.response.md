Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the variable `ops`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `vx` remains unchanged.
   - `p1` is a list containing all elements of `vx` except for the last two elements.
   - `p2` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, which means it iterates over `ops` in reverse order.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`.
   - The values of `v1` and `v2` will be taken from each tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `vx` remains unchanged.
   - `p1` and `p2` are not directly relevant to the loop execution since they are not used within the loop itself.
   - `ops` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`vx` remains unchanged, `ops` must have at least one element**.
