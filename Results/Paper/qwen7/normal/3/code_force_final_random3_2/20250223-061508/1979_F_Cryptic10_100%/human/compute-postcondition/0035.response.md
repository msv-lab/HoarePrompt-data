Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over pairs `(v1, v2)` from the list `ops[::-1]`.
   - Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `v1`, `v2`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ops`:**
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included.
   - The length of `ops` is equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `p1` is a list containing the two elements of `vx`.
   - `p2` is an empty list.
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both of which are integers from 1 to `t-2`.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, and the length of `ops` is equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the initial state of `ops` should be considered.
   - The loop will start with the last tuple in `ops` and proceed backwards. Therefore, the initial state of `ops` must be such that it contains valid tuples and its length matches the number of iterations.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must contain valid tuples and its length must match the number of iterations.
- `v1` and `v2` will be the first elements of the tuples in `ops` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`ops` must contain valid tuples and its length must match the number of iterations, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`**.
