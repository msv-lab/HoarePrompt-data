Output State: **All elements of `vx` have been reduced to 2 elements or fewer, `ops` contains a series of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except for the last two elements, and `p2` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `len(vx) > 2`.
- Each iteration removes elements from `vx` and appends operations to `ops`.
- After all iterations, `vx` will have exactly 2 elements remaining.
- `ops` will contain a sequence of tuples detailing the operations performed during each iteration.
- `p1` will contain all elements of `vx` except for the last two elements, as these are removed in each iteration.
- `p2` remains an empty list because it is not modified within the loop.
