Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing either one or two tuples, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains the tuple `('v1', 'v2')`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains the tuples `('v3', 0)` and `('v1', 0)`, and `vx` does not contain `v3`.
