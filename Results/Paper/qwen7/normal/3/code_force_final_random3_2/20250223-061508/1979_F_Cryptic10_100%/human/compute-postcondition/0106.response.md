Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, `ops` is added with `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`**.

Explanation: The code adds two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple contains `v3` and `0`, and the second tuple contains `v1` and `0`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is `len(vx) - 4` and `len(vx) - 3` respectively. The length of `vx` has decreased by one due to the removal of an element. The value of `v3` remains the return value of `q(0)`.
