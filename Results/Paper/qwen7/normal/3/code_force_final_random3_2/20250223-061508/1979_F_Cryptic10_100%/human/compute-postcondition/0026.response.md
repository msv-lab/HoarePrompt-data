Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, and now `ops` includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` where both `v1` and `v2` are equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`**.

This means that the list `ops` has been updated to include one more tuple, which is `(v1, v2)`. Given the conditions, `v1` and `v2` are both equal to `q(len(vx) - 2)`. All other variables retain their original constraints and values.
