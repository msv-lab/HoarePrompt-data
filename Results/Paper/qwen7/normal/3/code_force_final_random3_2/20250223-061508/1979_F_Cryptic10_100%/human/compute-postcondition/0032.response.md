Output State: `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are integers from 1 to `t-2`, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, and the length of `ops` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed. Each tuple in `ops` represents an operation performed during the loop's iterations, with `v1` and `v2` being elements from `vx` and `v3` being an element from `vx` when the else part of the loop was executed.
