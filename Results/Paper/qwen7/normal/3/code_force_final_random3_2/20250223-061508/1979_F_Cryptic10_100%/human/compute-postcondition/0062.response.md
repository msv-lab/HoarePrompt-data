Output State: **`ops` is a list containing either one or two tuples., `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one., `p2` is an empty list., `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2., `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, `vx` has had its second last element removed., `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, and the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` is discarded., `vx` has had its second last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v3)` removes the element `v3` from the list `vx`. Since `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` is discarded, the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)` is the element that gets removed from `vx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
