Output State: **`p2` is now a list containing the elements of its original content followed by `v1`, `ops` remains unchanged, `vx` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is true, then `p2` is used; otherwise, `p1` is used. In either case, `v1` is appended to the resulting list. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `p1` and `v2`, we only know that `v1` is appended to the list that was selected (either `p2` or `p1`), and the other variables (`ops` and `vx`) remain unchanged.
