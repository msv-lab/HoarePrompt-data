Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2`, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)`, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`.**

Explanation: The code `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `t`, `n`, `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged, except that now `ops` contains the new tuple.
