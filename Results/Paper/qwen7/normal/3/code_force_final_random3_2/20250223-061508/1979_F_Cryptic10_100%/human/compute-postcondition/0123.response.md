Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the iterable `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple, which now has its first element appended with `v1`.
   - `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.
   - `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ops[::-1]`, it means the loop is processing the tuples from the end of the list to the beginning.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the last tuple in `ops` was modified to append `v1` to its first element. This means the last tuple in `ops` now looks like `(v1 + some_value, v2)`.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will process the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list (which is now the third-to-last in `ops[::-1]`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ops`: The list `ops` will now have its last tuple as `(v1 + some_value, v2)`, and the second-to-last tuple will be the new last tuple for the next iteration.
   - `v1`: This will be the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - `v2`: This will be the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.**

State: **`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.**
