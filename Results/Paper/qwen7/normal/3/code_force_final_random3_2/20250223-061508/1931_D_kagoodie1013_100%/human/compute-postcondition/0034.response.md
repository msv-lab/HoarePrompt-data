Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0), `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `current_key` and value 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` increments the count of the current key in the `residue_map` dictionary.
- Initially, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
- The current key `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.
- Since `residue_map` is empty, `residue_map.get(current_key, 0)` returns 0.
- Therefore, `residue_map[current_key]` is set to `0 + 1`, which means `residue_map` now contains the key `current_key` with a value of 1.
- The other variables (`count`, `results`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
