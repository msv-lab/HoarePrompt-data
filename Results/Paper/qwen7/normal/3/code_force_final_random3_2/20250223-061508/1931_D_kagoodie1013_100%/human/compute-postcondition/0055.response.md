Output State: **`count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

In more natural language, this means:
- The variable `count` is incremented by the value found when looking up the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the dictionary `residue_map`. If the key does not exist, it adds 0.
- All other variables (`r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
