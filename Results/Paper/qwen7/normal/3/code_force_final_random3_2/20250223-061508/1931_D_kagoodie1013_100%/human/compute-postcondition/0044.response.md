Output State: **`count` is `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 2`, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` and value 2, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates `count` by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which is 2 since `residue_map` has the key `(-num % x, num % y)` with a value of 2. Therefore, `count` is updated to its previous value plus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
