Output State: **`count` is 0, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is the last calculated value of `num % y`, `current_key` is the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_x` to `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `r_x` now depends on the current values of `num` and `x`. The other variables (`count`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) retain their previous values.
