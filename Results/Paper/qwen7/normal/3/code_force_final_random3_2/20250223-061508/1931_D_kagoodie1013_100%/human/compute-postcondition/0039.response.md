The code updates the value of `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`. This means that `r_x` is now `num % x` and `r_y` is now `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(num % x, num % y)` and value 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `r_y` is `num % y`.**
