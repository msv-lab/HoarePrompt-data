Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is calculated as `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`.
   - `results` contains the value of `count`.
   - `r_x` is `num % x`.
   - `r_y` is `num % y`.
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(num % x, num % y)` and value 2.
   - `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `r_y` is `num % y`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr`, the variable `num` will be updated to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`count`, `results`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num`.

**State: **`count` is `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is `num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(num % x, num % y)` and value 2, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `r_y` is `num % y`**.
