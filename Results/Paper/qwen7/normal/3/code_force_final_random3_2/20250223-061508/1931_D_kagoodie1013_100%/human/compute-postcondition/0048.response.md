Output State: **`results` contains the final value of `count`, `r_x` and `r_y` are the last calculated values of `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, `current_key` is the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` contains all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are empty or irrelevant to the final state since the loop has completed.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. This means that `results` now contains the final value of `count`, which is the sum of all values in `residue_map`'s values plus the sum of `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`. The variables `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` retain their last calculated values from the loop. The variables `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are no longer relevant since the loop has completed.
