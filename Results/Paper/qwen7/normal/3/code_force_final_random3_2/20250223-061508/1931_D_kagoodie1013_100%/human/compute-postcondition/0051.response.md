Output State: **`count` is 0, `r_x` is the last calculated value of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the last calculated value of `num % y`, `current_key` is the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

The code initializes `residue_map` as an empty dictionary, which means all other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
