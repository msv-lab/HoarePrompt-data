Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(r_x, r_y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, `r_y` is updated to `num % y`**.

This means that `r_y` has been updated to the new value of `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
