Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts. It then processes each test case one by one, storing the necessary information in `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program:
   - Extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - Uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the frequency of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` where:
     - `r_x = (-num) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - For each element `num` in `arr`, it updates the `count` by adding the frequency of the current `(r_x, r_y)` pair from `residue_map`. It also updates the frequency of the current `(r_x, r_y)` pair in `residue_map`.

3. **Result Collection**: After processing all elements in the array for the current test case, the `count` is appended to the `results` list.

4. **Return Results**: Finally, the function returns the `results` list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the logic and the state annotations, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or missing steps.

Correctness: **True**
