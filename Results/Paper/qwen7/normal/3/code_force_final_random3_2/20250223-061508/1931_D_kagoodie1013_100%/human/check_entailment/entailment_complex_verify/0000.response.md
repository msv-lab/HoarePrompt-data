### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
   - It then processes each test case, extracting the necessary parameters and storing them in `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, the function initializes a counter `count` and a dictionary `residue_map`.
   - It iterates through each number in the array `arr` and computes the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for each number.
   - The value `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, which effectively gives the remainder when `num` is divided by `x` but adjusted to ensure non-negative results.
   - The value `r_y` is simply `num % y`.
   - The function checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to `count`.
   - It then updates the count of the current pair `(num % x, num % y)` in `residue_map`.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The use of `-num % x` ensures that the result is always non-negative. For example, if `num % x == 0`, `-num % x` will still be `0`, and if `num % x != 0`, `-num % x` will be `x - (num % x)`.
   - This approach correctly identifies the residues and ensures that the conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` are met.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all potential cases as described. It correctly processes large inputs within the constraints (up to \(2 \times 10^5\) elements per array).
   - No specific edge cases were found that would make the program incorrect. The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

5. **Output**:
   - The function appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and returns it.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program handles all potential cases and no edge cases were found that would make the program incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate.
