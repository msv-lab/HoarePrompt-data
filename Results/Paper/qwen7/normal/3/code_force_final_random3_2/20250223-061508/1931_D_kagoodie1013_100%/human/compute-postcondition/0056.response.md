Output State: **`count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The line `current_key = num % x, num % y` updates the value of `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`. This means that `current_key` now holds the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, which replaces the previous value of `current_key` (which was `(r_x, r_y)`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
