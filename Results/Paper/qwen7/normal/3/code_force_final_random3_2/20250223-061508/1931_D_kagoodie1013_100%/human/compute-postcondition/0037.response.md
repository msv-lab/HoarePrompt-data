Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0), `results` contains the value of `count`, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `current_key` and value 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `r_y` is updated to `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_y` to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
