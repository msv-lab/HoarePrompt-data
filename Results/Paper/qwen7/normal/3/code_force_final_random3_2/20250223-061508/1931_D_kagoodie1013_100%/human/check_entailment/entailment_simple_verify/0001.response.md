### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided program. Let's break down the key points to ensure the analysis is thorough:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens. It then processes this input to extract the necessary information for each test case.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input format and ensures that the data is parsed correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program correctly extracts the values of \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), as well as the array \( arr \).
   - The use of a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of residues is efficient and correct. The keys in the dictionary are tuples of residues, which uniquely identify each combination of residues modulo \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program correctly calculates the residues for each element in the array using `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`. This ensures that the residues are correctly handled, even for negative numbers.
   - The program then uses these residues to find pairs that satisfy the conditions \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x} \) and \( a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y} \).
   - The logic for counting pairs is sound. For each element, it checks if there exists another element with the same residues, which directly translates to the problem's requirements.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The count of such pairs is accumulated in the variable `count`, and the final count for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - The use of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` ensures that the count is correctly incremented based on the frequency of the residues.

Given the detailed verification and the correctness of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.
