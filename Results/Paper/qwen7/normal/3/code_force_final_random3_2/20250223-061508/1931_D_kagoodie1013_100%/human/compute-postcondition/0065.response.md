Output State: **`count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` must have at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `r_x` as `-num % x`. This does not affect the values of `count`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `num`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`.
- The value of `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`.
- The value of `count` remains the same as its original value plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- The value of `r_y` remains `num % y`.
- The value of `current_key` remains `(num % x, num % y)`.
- The value of `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.
- `num` is updated to the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `x` is updated to the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `y` is updated to the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is updated to the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and it must have at least one element.
