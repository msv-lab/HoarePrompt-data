Output State: **The program returns the list `results` which contains the total count of occurrences of each unique pair (r_x, r_y) found across all arrays arr in `test_cases` according to the given conditions.**

This means that the program returns a list where each element corresponds to the count of a unique pair (r_x, r_y) found in the test cases. The list `results` is built up during the execution of the loop, where `count` keeps track of the cumulative sum of these occurrences for each unique pair, and `residue_map` records all unique pairs along with their frequencies. The final values of `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from the last tuple in `test_cases` are also considered in the process.
