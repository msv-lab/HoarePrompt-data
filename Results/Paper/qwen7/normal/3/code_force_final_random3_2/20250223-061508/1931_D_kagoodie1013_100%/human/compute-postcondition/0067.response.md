Output State: **`count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_y` is updated to be `num % y`, `count` is updated to be the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`**.

This means that the `count` variable is incremented by the value found in `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`, where `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x` and `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`. The `current_key` remains unchanged as it is defined as `(num % x, num % y)`. The variables `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are set to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`. The variable `r_y` is updated to be `num % y`.
