Output State: **`count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_key` to be `(num % x, num % y)`. No other variables are affected. The value of `count` is updated to be its original value plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which was already accounted for before this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `current_key` and the unchanged `count` with the addition of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
