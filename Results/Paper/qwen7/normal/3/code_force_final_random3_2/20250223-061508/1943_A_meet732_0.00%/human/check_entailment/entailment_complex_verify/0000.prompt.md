You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

            print(0)

            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the list `cntl` will contain the frequency of each number appearing in the list `a`. Specifically, for each index `i` in `a`, the value at `cntl[i]` will be the number of times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain as 0. Additionally, if `cntl[0]` is 0, the loop will check if `j` equals `n` and `cntl[j]` is less than 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`. If these conditions are met, the loop will break, and the smallest `j` satisfying the condition will be printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the loop will also break when `j` equals `n`, and no value will be printed since `c` will be 0.
    #
    #In summary, `cntl` will reflect the frequency of each element in `a`, and the loop will either print the smallest `j` for which `cntl[j]` is less than 2 (excluding 0), or it will not print anything if no such `j` exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it constructs a frequency count of the numbers in the list \( a \) using the `cntl` list. It then checks if any number in \( a \) appears fewer than 2 times (excluding zero). If such a number exists, it prints the smallest one; otherwise, it prints nothing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can pick any element from the array `a` on her turn, and she appends it to her array `c`, whereas Bob only removes elements from `a`. The program incorrectly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` and determines the MEX based on these counts, without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct simulation would be:
1. Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[0, 1]`, `c` becomes `[0]`.
2. Bob picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` remains `[0]`.
3. Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[]`, `c` becomes `[0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

However, the provided program will output `2` for this case, which is incorrect because it does not simulate the turns correctly. It simply counts the occurrences and determines the MEX, which does not reflect the optimal play strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
