Based on the initial state described:

- The list `cntl` will have its elements incremented based on the integers present in the list `a`.
- For each integer `i` in `a`, the corresponding index `i` in `cntl` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `cntl` will contain the count of how many times each integer from `a` appeared.
- The loop will terminate because either `a` is empty or `j` (which is equivalent to `i` in this context) equals `n`.
- The current value of `cntl[0]` is explicitly stated to be 0.

Given this information, the `print(0)` statement will simply print the integer 0.

Output: **0**
