Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 elements, each initialized to 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
