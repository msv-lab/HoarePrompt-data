Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and c is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. The values of `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the action of breaking out of the loop is noted.
