Output State: The variable `cntl` will have been updated such that for each index `i` present in the list `a`, the value at `cntl[i]` will be equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain as 0. The list `a` will remain unchanged from its initial state.

This means that if `a` contains the elements `[2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3]`, then after the loop completes, `cntl` will be updated to reflect the count of each element in `a`, like so: `cntl = [0, 1, 2, 3]` where the index represents the element from `a` and the value at that index represents how many times it appeared in `a`.
