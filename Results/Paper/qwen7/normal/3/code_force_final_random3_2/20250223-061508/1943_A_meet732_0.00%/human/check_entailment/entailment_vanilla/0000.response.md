Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This is done correctly using `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

3. **Determining the Initial MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the program prints `0`. This is correct because if there are no zeros in the array, the MEX must be `0` since `0` is the smallest non-negative integer that cannot be in the array.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is also correct because Alice can always pick a `0` first, and Bob will have at most one chance to pick a `0` before Alice can pick it again.

4. **Adjusting MEX Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n` and decreases `c` by `1` for each element that appears less than twice.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end of the array without breaking, it prints the current index `j`.

### Correctness Verification

- **Initial Condition Handling:** 
  - When `cntl[0]` is zero, the program correctly outputs `0`, which is the correct MEX.
  
- **General Case:**
  - The logic for calculating `c` and adjusting it based on the counts of other elements is sound. Alice can ensure that `0` is included in `c` initially, and Bob can only remove it once. After that, Alice can ensure that the next smallest missing number is added to `c`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `cntl[0]` is zero correctly.
  - The program also handles cases where the counts of other elements are less than two, ensuring that the MEX is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal MEX value for the given game scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
