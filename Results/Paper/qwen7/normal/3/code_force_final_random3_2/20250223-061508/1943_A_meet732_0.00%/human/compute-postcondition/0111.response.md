Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `j` is 1.
2. `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
3. `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1, but since `j` is 1, this condition is true regardless of the actual value of `cntl[1]`.
4. `c` is one less than its original value, but the original value of `c` is not specified.
5. Either `c` is not True or `j` is equal to `n`. Since `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, `j` being equal to `n` is not necessarily true unless `n` is also 1. However, the condition also states that `c` is not True, which means `c` must be False (assuming `c` is a boolean).

Given these conditions, the only variable that needs to be printed is `j`, which is explicitly stated to be 1.

Output: **1**
