Postcondition: **For each index `i` present in the list `a`, the value at `cntl[i]` will be equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain as 0. The list `a` will remain unchanged from its initial state. Additionally, if `cntl[0] == 0`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, after the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be 0, and `cntl[j]` will be 0 for all indices in `cntl` that were incremented during the loop.**
