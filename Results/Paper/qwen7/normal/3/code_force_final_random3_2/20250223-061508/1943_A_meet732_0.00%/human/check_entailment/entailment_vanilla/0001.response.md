Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It creates a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` initialized to zero.
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for Zero**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0`. This means there are no zeros in the array, and since Alice can pick any zero to maximize the MEX, the MEX will be `0`.

4. **Calculating MEX**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, it initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`.
   - It then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - Decrements `c` for each element that appears less than twice.
     - If `c` becomes zero or the loop reaches the end of the range, it prints the current index `j`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Handling Zeros**:
   - If there are no zeros (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX must be `0` because Alice can always pick a zero to make the MEX `0`.
   - This part is correctly handled.

2. **Calculating MEX**:
   - The logic to calculate the MEX is flawed. Here's why:
     - Alice and Bob play optimally, so they will try to minimize and maximize the MEX respectively.
     - The program assumes that Alice can always pick enough zeros to ensure the MEX is `2` if there are at least two zeros, but this is not always true.
     - The program also incorrectly handles the case where there are more than two zeros but fewer than `n` elements.
     - The program does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, especially when there are multiple zeros and other elements.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

- The program outputs `2`, but the correct output should be `0` because Alice can pick both zeros first, making the array `c = [0, 0]`, and the MEX of `[0, 0]` is `1`.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
