Postcondition: **The list `cntl` will have each element set to the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`. Specifically, if the value `i` appears `x` times in the list `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` will remain 0. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is equal to 0**.
