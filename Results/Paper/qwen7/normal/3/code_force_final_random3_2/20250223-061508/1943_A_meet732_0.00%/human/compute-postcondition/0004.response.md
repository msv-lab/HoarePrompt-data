Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is being iterated over the list `a`, the initial value of `i` will be the first element of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state of `a`**: The list `a` is already defined as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. No adjustment is needed for `a` itself.

4. **Determine the state of `cntl`**: The list `cntl` is of length `n + 1` where every element is 0. This state does not change within the loop head and is not directly affected by the loop.

5. **Determine the state of `t` and `n`**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop head, but they might influence the loop's behavior indirectly. However, since the question asks us to focus only on the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to adjust `t` or `n`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which will be the first element of the list `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0**
