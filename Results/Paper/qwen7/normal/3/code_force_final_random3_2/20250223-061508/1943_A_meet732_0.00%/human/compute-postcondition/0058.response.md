Postcondition: **The list `cntl` will have its elements incremented based on the integers present in the list `a`. Specifically, for each integer `i` in `a`, the corresponding index `i` in `cntl` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl` will contain the count of how many times each integer from `a` appeared, and the loop will have terminated because either `a` is empty or `j` (which is equivalent to `i` in this context) equals `n`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.**
