Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and c is decreased by 1.**

The value of `j` is decremented by 1, making it 2. The conditions for `n` and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged. The variable `c` is also decremented by 1 but its exact value before the operation is not specified, so we only state that it has been decreased by 1.
