Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 1**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1, but since `c` was not defined in the initial state, it is implied that `c` might have been equal to `cntl[j]` (which is less than 2). After decrementing, `c` would now be `cntl[j] - 1`, which means `cntl[j]` is now less than 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
