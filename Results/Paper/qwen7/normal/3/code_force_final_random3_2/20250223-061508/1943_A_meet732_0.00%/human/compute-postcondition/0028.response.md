Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1.

4. **Condition for Breaking Out of the Loop**: 
   - The loop breaks if `c` is false or if `j` is equal to `n`.

5. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its current value of 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 2.
   - Since `n` must still be greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `cntl[j]` (which is now `cntl[2]`) does not affect the continuation of the loop, but it must still be valid for the rest of the loop body.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The condition `cntl[2]` is not specified to change, so it remains less than or equal to 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 1**.
