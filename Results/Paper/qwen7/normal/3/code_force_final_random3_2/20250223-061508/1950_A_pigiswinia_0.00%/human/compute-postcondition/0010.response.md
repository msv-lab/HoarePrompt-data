Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers split from the input. If the condition `a < b > c` is true, the program does not change the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the condition `a < b > c` is false, the program does not change the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
