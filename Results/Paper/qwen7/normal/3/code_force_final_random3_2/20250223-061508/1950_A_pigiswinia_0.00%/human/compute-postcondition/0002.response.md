Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` remains 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers split from the input.
