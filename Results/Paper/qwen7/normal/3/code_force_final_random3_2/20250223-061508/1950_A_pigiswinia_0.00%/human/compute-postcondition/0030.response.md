Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integers a, b, and c (where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) within a loop for each test case t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and returns different values based on the conditions met during the processing.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
