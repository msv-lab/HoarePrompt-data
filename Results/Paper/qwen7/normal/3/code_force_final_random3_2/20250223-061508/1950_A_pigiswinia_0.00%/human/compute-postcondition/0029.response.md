Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(t-1\), `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is the third integer from the input.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the integers from the last set of inputs provided, since these values are read in each iteration but not modified within the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
