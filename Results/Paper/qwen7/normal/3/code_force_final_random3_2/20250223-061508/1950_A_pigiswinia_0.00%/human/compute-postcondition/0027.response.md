Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input. Since the if condition `a < b < c` does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
