Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
