Output State: `t` is 0, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.

After all the iterations of the loop, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their last updated state after the last iteration of the loop.
