t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0; the vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
