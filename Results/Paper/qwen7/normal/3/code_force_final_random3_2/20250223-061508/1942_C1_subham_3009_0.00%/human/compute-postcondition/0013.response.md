Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than -1 (though this does not affect the print statement).
- `__name__` is `__main__` (this also does not affect the print statement).
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `x` is an integer from the input.
- `y` is an integer from the input.
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.

The print statement is `print(x - 2)`. Here, `x` is one of the integers from the input. Therefore, the expression `x - 2` will be evaluated and printed.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is an integer from the input)**
