You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

        #
        #After all the iterations of the loop, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their last updated state after the last iteration of the loop.
    #State: `t` is 0, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, and `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. It also reads the list of `x` vertices that Bessie has chosen.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, ensuring that `n` is within the range `[4, 10^9]`, `x` is within `[2, min(n, 2 * 10^5)]`, and `y` is always `0`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of `x` vertices that Bessie has chosen and converts them into integers.

3. **Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - The formula `print(x - 2)` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the number of triangles that can be formed is dependent on the number of vertices `n` and the number of chosen vertices `x`.
   - Specifically, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` vertices is `n - 2`. However, since Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, the remaining vertices available for forming triangles are `n - x`. Therefore, the correct calculation should be `max(0, n - x - 2)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program should output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake, which is `max(0, n - x - 2)`.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it uses `x - 2` instead of `max(0, n - x - 2)` to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
**False**
