Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- For each test case, the function reads three integers n, x, and y (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0).
- It then reads x distinct integers from 1 to n.
- The function processes this input and returns a result for each test case, though the specific nature of the return value is not detailed in the provided information.
