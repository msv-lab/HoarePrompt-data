Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of strings representing the first `x` integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The previous values of `t`, `__name__`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The new variable `arr` is created and contains the split input as a list of strings.
