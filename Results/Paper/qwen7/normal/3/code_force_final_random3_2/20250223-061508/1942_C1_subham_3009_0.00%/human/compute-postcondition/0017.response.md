Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of strings where each element is the string representation of the integer from the input corresponding to its index.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `arr`. Each element in the list `arr` is the string representation of an integer from the input, corresponding to its index. The values of `t`, `__name__`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
