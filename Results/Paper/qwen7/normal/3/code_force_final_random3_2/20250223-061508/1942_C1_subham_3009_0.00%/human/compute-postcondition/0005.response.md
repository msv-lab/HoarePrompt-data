Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing three integers split from the input, `arr` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` takes the input provided by the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `__name__`, and `[n, x, y]`) remain unchanged.
