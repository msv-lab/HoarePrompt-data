Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 7.

3. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 1 (which it already is).
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 2).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 7 (since this condition is not part of the loop head).

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 7**
