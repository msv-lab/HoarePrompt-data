Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j in range(4, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must still be less than `n + 1`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` needs to be updated to `j + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can express the new state in terms of the conditions.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` must be less than `n + 1` and equal to `j + 1`**.

To make it clearer:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `j` must be less than `n + 1` and equal to `j + 1` (which means `j` will be incremented by 1).

Thus, the final state can be expressed as:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` must be less than `n + 1` and equal to `j + 1`**.
