Output State: `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 4.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `j` will be equal to the final value of `n`, and `n` must initially be at least 4 for the loop to run at least once.
