Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables and objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop control variable is `n`.

2. Determine the initial values or conditions required for the loop to execute:
   - The loop `for j in range(4, n + 1):` will execute if the condition `4 <= j < n + 1` is satisfied.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute.

3. Consider the given states before the loop:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` must be 1.

4. Adjust the states based on the loop requirements:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, `n` must be greater than 4.
   - The value of `i` and `t` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution, but they should still be included as they are part of the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` must be 1`**
