Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) for a given \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program attempts to generate points in the grid to achieve this goal. However, the logic within the program is flawed and does not consistently maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Specifically, the program:
- Always prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2).
- Prints (2, 3) only when \(n = 3\).
- Prints (2, 4) and then a series of points (j, j) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) for \(n > 3\).

This approach does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). For example:
- For \(n = 3\), the program correctly prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), but this does not cover all possible distances.
- For \(n = 4\), the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), which does not cover all possible distances.
- For \(n = 5\), the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), which again does not cover all possible distances.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible distances and strategically place points to maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
