Output State: **`i` is 5, `preb` is `preb + pathb[4]`, `len(pathb)` is greater than 4, and `resb` is the maximum value between `resb` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The conditions and values of `i`, `preb`, `len(pathb)`, and the comparison involving `k` remain unchanged.
