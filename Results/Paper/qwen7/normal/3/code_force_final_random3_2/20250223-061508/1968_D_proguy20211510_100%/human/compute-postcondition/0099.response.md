Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `curr` is `pres * (k - (length_of_pathb))`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the length of `pathb`, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` will also be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, and `ress` will hold the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.
