Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input is a single string, these four variables will each hold a substring of the original input. The values of `t`, `MOD`, and `alpha` remain unchanged.
