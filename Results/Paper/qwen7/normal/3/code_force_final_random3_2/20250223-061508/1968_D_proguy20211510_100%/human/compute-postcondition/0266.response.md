The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least one more time unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the total number of elements added to `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is the final value it takes when the loop breaks, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` and the appended value, `vis[ps - 1]` is updated to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and now equals `p[ps - 1]`, and the condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` remains true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
