Output State: **`i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `i`, which was initially 3. It only indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure.
