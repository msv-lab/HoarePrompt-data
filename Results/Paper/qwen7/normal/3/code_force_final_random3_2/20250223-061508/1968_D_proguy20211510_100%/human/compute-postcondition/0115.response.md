Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, pb, ps = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into four parts, assigning each part to the respective variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since `pathb` and `paths` are lists, `pb` and `ps` represent their sums. The variable `i` is initially set to the length of `paths`, and `curr` is defined based on `pres` and the length of `paths`. The variable `ress` keeps track of the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations. After executing this line, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are updated, while the other variables remain unchanged in terms of their definitions.
