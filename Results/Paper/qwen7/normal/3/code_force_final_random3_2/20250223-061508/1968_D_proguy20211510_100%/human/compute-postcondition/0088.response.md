Postcondition: `i` is length_of_pathb + 1, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb], `curr` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb] * (k - (length_of_pathb + 1)), `ress` is the maximum of ress and curr. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
