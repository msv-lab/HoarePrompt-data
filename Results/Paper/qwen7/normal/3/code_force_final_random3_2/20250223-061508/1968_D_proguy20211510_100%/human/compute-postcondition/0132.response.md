Postcondition: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1]]`, `paths` is an empty list, and the element at index `pb - 1` of `vis` is equal to 1. Additionally, if `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.
