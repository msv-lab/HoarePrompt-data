Output State: **`i` is `length_of_pathb + 2`, `preb` is `0`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[length_of_pathb] + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the assignments to `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` were made. The values of `i`, `preb`, `pathb`, `len(paths)`, `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
