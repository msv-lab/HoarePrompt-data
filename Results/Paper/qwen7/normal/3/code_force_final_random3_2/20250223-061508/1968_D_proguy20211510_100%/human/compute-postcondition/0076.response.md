Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed. The final value of `resb` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `pathb`, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, and the loop condition `k < i + 1` will be false.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `resb` will hold the maximum value obtained from the expression `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for each iteration, where `i` ranges from 0 to the length of `pathb` minus 1. The variable `i` will end up being equal to the length of `pathb`, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, and the loop will exit because the condition `k < i + 1` will no longer be satisfied.
