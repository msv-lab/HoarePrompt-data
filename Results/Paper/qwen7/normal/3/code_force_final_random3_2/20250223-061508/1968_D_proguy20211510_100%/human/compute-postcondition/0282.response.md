Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `preb` by adding the value of `pathb[i]` to it. Initially, `i` is 0, so `preb` is updated to `pathb[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
