The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least one more time unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since we need to provide a modified state based on the given format, we can simply repeat the state from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`; `paths` now contains the elements `a[ps - 1]` added to it; if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
