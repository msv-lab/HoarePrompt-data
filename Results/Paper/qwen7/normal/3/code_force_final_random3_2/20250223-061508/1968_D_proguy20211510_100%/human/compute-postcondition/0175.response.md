Output State: **`preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is `0`, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `pathb[1] * k`, `resb` is `max(resb, pathb[0] * k)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, `i`, `curr`, and `resb` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
