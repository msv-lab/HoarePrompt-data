Output State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the final value reached when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `ps` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ...]` (where the number of elements is determined by how many times the loop executed until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`), `paths` is updated to include `a[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. This changes the value of `paths` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state descriptions.
