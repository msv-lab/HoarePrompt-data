Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `i` is 3, `preb` is increased by `pathb[0]`, and `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 2, and it gets incremented by 1 due to the line `i += 1`, making `i` equal to 3.
- `preb` is increased by `pathb[0]`, which is part of the condition to update `resb`.
- The line `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` calculates `curr` as `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, since `i` is now 3.
- The value of `resb` remains unchanged from the initial postcondition unless `resb` is updated in a subsequent operation, but it is stated to be the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[0] * k`, which is already considered in the initial postcondition.
