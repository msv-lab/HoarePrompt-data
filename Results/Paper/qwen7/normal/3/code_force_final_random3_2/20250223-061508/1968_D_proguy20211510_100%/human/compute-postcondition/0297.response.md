Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[3]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 5, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, and `preb` is defined as `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[3]`, we can express `curr` as `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `pathb[0] + 2 * pathb[1] * (k - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
