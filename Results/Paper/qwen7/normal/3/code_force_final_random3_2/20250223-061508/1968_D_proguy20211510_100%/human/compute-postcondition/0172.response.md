Output State: **`preb` is 0 + `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * k`, `resb` is `max(resb, pathb[0] * k)`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value (`resb`) and the current value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is defined as `pathb[0] * k`, `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `pathb[0] * k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
