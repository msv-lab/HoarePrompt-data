Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of a player moving to their new position multiple times within a single turn. This can significantly affect the final scores.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `P_B = 1`, `P_S = 1`
- `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
- `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

According to the problem description, both players start at position 1. In the first turn, both players will stay at position 1 and add `a[1]` to their score. In the second turn, both players will move to their new positions (which are `p[1] = 2` for both). However, the program only considers the score contribution once per turn, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        def calculate_score(start_pos, k):
            path = []
            pos = start_pos - 1
            while True:
                path.append(a[pos])
                pos = p[pos] - 1
                if pos == start_pos - 1:
                    break
            return max(sum(path[:i]) * (k - i) + sum(path[i:]) for i in range(len(path) + 1))

        resb = calculate_score(pb, k)
        ress = calculate_score(ps, k)

        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

This corrected version ensures that the score is calculated correctly by considering all possible movements within a single turn.
