Output State: **`preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and the condition `k < i + 1` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since the condition `k < i + 1` is true before the `break` statement, it remains true after the `break` statement is executed.
