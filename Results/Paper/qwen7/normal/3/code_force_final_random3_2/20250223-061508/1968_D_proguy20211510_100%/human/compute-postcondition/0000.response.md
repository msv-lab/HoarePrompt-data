Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of length n; a is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; YES, NO = 'YES', 'NO'**

Explanation: The code defines two strings, `YES` and `NO`, with their respective values set to the strings `'YES'` and `'NO'`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
