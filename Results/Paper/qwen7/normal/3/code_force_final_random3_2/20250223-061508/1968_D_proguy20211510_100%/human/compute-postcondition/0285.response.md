Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within the given code snippet, the values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
