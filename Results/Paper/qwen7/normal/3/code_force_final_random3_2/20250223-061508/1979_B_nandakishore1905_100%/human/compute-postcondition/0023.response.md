Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2 ** (`p` - 1)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 ** (p - 1)` to the variable `q`. The value of `p` remains unchanged as it is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. Therefore, `q` is calculated based on the value of `p`.
