Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of the integer `f-2`, `q` is 2, `f` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary string representation using `bin(f)`, which includes the '0b' prefix. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes the '0b' prefix from the binary string. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `q`, and `f` remain unchanged.
