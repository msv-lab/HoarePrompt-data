Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, `k` can be any non-negative integer depending on the values of `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
