Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (which is stored in `k`) into its binary representation using the `bin()` function and removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The resulting binary string is then assigned to the variable `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
