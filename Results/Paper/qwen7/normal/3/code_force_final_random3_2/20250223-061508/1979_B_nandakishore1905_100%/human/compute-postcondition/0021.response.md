Output State: **`l` is a binary representation of the integer value of `f` with '0b' prefix removed.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer value of `f` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes this prefix, leaving only the binary digits. No other variables are affected by this code.
