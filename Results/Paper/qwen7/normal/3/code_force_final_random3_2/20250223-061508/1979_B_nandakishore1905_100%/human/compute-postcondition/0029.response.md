Output State: **`f` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as `2 ** (p - 1)`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation `l` of `f - 2`. The values of `f`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `q` is calculated based on the length of `l`, which is derived from `f - 2`.
