Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. Since `n` and `m` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
