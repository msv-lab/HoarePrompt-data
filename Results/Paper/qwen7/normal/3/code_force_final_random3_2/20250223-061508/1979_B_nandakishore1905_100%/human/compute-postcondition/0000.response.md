Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input, but based on the given constraints, it must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing by adjusting the state of `i` and `int(input())`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

- **Initial Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than the value of `int(input())`. The smallest possible value of `int(input())` is 1, so `i` should be 0 or less than the value of `int(input())`.

- **Value of `int(input())`**: This value must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). 

### Final State Adjustment:

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure that `int(input())` is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
