Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

The code appends a tuple consisting of the current values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated as described, but no other changes are made to the initial state.
