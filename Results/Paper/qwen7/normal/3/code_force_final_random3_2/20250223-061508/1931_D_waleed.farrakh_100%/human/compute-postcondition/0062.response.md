Postcondition: `arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `count` remains unchanged; `current_pair` is either incremented in frequency by 1 if it was already in `freq`, or added to `freq` with a count of 1 if it was not previously present.
