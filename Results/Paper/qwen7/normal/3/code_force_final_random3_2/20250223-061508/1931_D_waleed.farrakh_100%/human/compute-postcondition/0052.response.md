Output State: **`arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; the tuple (rx, ry) is in `freq`; `count` is increased by `freq[rx, ry]`.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
