Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`, and `freq[(a % x, a % y)]` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `current_pair = a % x, a % y` updates the `current_pair` variable to be a tuple consisting of `a % x` and `a % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The `current_pair` is now explicitly defined as `(a % x, a % y)`.
