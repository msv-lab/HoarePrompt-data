Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The only variable being iterated over here is `result`.

2. **Determine the state changes**: Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the state of `result` will change with each iteration. However, the problem does not specify what happens to `result` inside the loop body. Therefore, we cannot assume any changes to `result` without additional information.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `results`. At the end of the previous iteration, it is mentioned that `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**: For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `results` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `idx` is 4, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` must contain at least one element**
