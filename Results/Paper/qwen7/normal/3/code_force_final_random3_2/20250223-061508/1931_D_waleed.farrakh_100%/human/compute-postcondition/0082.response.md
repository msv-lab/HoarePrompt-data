Output State: **`arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `a` is the value of `arr`; `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x); `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the dictionary `freq` has its count for the key `current_pair` increased by 1. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
