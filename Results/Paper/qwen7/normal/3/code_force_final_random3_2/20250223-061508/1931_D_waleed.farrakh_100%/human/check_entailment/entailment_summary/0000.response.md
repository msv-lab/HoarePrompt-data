Reasoning:
- The problem requires counting the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions.
- `func_2()` reads the input correctly and organizes the test cases into a structured format suitable for processing by `func_1()`.
- `func_1()` is designed to process each test case by calculating the frequency of unique pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and then summing up the frequencies of these pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
- The logic within `func_1()` appears to correctly implement the conditions for identifying beautiful pairs:
  - It uses the modulo operation to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
  - It counts the occurrences of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` and uses these counts to determine the number of beautiful pairs.
- Given that both functions (`func_1()` and `func_2()`) are designed to handle the problem as described and the execution summaries align with the expected behavior, the overall implementation should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
