### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to ensure its correctness.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Loop Through Array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - Calculate `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`. If it is, add the corresponding count to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return Results**:
   - Append the final count to `results` and return the list of counts.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the entire input from standard input and split it into lines.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Append the test case details to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` and collect the results.
   - Print each result.

#### Annotated Code:

- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at various points.
- However, there is a critical issue in the annotated code regarding the state of `test_cases` and `results` after the loop in `func_2`.

### Key Issue:

In the annotated code for `func_2`, it states that `test_cases` will be an empty list after the loop. This is incorrect because `test_cases` is populated with `t` test cases during the loop. The annotated code incorrectly suggests that `test_cases` is empty, which is not true.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Test Case Processing**:
   - In `func_2`, the loop runs `t` times, each time reading a new test case and appending it to `test_cases`.
   - After the loop, `test_cases` will contain `t` test cases, not an empty list.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` is correctly tracked and used to count beautiful pairs.
   - The logic for checking the conditions for a beautiful pair is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all described cases correctly, including when `x` and `y` are equal, and when the array elements are large.

### Conclusion:

The annotated code incorrectly states that `test_cases` is an empty list after the loop in `func_2`, which is not true. However, the core logic of the program is correct and handles the problem as specified.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct in its implementation and logic, despite the minor annotation error.
