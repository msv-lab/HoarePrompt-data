Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to store the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - Calculate `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which ensures `rx` is non-negative.
     - Calculate `ry = a % y`.
     - Check if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count from `freq[rx, ry]` to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return results**:
   - Append the final `count` to `results` and return `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once.
   - Splits the input into lines.
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` and appends them to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and stores the results.
   - Prints each result.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Modulo Calculation**:
   - The expression `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative. This is correct because `-a % x` can be negative, but adding `x` and taking modulo `x` ensures it is within `[0, x-1]`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating and checking frequencies is correct. It ensures that each pair `(rx, ry)` is counted correctly.

3. **Pair Checking**:
   - The conditions for a pair being "beautiful" are correctly checked using the modulo operations.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and efficient for large inputs.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

### Conclusion

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

**Correctness: **True**
