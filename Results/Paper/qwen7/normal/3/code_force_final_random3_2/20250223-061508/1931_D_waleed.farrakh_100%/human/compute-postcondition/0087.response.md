Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been processed; `count` is the sum of `freq[rx, ry]` for each unique pair `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`, plus 1 for each occurrence of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`; `rx` and `ry` are calculated for the last element `a` in `arr`; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `freq` is updated to reflect the frequency of each unique pair `(rx, ry)` and `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during the loop execution.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will be the total number of occurrences of each unique pair `(rx, ry)` found in `arr`, plus one for each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` seen throughout the array. The variables `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` will correspond to the last element processed in `arr`. The dictionary `freq` will contain the frequency of each unique pair `(rx, ry)` and `(a % x, a % y)` that was encountered during the loop.
