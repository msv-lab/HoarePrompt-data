### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) such that:
  1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function iterates through each test case.
   - For each element \(a\) in the array, it calculates the remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to count how many times each pair of remainders has been seen.
   - If a pair of remainders has been seen before, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads input from standard input, splitting it into test cases.
   - Each test case consists of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).
   - Passes the test cases to `func_1`.
   - Prints the results returned by `func_1`.

#### Function Summaries Recap:
- Function 2 reads input, organizes test cases, and passes them to `func_1`.
- Function 1 correctly processes each test case and counts the number of beautiful pairs.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative.
   - The condition `a % y` directly checks the divisibility by \(y\).

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The frequency dictionary keeps track of pairs of remainders.
   - When a new pair is encountered, it updates the count of beautiful pairs based on previously seen pairs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like zero and negative numbers correctly due to the modulo operations.
   - The program ensures that all constraints (e.g., \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\)) are respected.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.
   - The implementation in `func_2` ensures that the input is processed correctly and passed to `func_1`.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. There are no apparent errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct.
