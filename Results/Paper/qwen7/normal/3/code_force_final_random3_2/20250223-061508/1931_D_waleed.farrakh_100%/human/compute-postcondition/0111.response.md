Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `count` remains unchanged, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1; `ry` is updated to a % y.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `ry` to `a % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated value of `ry` is now `a % y`, while all other variables retain their original values.
