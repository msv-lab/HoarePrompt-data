Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `rev_res` will be a string constructed based on the elements of `rev_val` where for each index `x` (starting from 0 and going up to the length of `rev_val` minus 1), if `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. Additionally, the value of `10 ** int(max_power)` will be greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`, and the loop will have processed all test cases. The variable `y` will be equal to the total number of test cases minus one, and the variables `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` will retain their final states after processing all inputs. The program will have printed 'Anna' for each test case where the condition \(10^{int(max_power)} \geq int(rev_res)\) holds true, and 'Sasha' otherwise.
