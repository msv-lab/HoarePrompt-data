Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `k + 1`, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` with the string representation of `val_in`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `rev_res += str(val_in)` appends the string representation of `val_in` to `rev_res`. The values of `rev_val` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`, which means `val_in` is the integer at index `x` in `rev_val`. Therefore, `rev_res` is updated by adding the string representation of `val_in` to its current value.
