Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1, `rev_res` will be a string that has been built by concatenating the string representations of integers when `x` is even and the reversed strings when `x` is odd, and `rev_val` will contain all its original elements as it was not modified within the loop. Additionally, the value of \(10^{int(max\_power)}\) will either be less than or greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)` depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.**
