Output State: **`x` is 2, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` plus the integer value of the reverse of `rev_val[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` takes the integer value of the reversed string of `rev_val[1]` and adds it to `rev_res`. Since `rev_val` contains at least one element, `rev_val[1]` refers to the second element in `rev_val`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The updated value of `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` plus the integer value of the reverse of `rev_val[1]`.
