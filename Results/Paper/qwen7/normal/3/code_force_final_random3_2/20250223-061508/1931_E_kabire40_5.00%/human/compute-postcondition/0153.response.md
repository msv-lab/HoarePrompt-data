Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is `k + 2`, `val_in` is the element at index `k + 2` in `rev_val`**

Explanation: The code assigns the element at index `x` (which is `k + 2`) in the list `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `rev_val` must still have at least one element, `x` remains as `k + 2`, and `val_in` now holds the value of the element at index `k + 2` in `rev_val`.
