Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `rev_val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `rev_val`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` stays as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The only new information is that `rev_val` is now an empty list.
