Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `x % 2`: if `x % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` remains unchanged; otherwise, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and the reverse of the string at index `x - 1` in `rev_val`. Additionally, the condition \(10^{int(max_power)} < int(rev_res)\) is checked, and the program behaves according to the if and else parts as described.**
