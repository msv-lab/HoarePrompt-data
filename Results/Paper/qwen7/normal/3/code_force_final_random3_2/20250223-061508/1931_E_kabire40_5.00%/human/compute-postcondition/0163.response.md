Postcondition: `rev_res` is a string constructed based on the elements of `rev_val` where for each index `x` (starting from 0 and going up to the length of `rev_val` minus 1), if `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. Furthermore, either `10 ** int(max_power)` is less than `int(rev_res)` or the value of `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.
