Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element; `x` is the second element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the value of `rev_res` by adding the value of `x` to it. The other variables (`operational_list` and `x_rev`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
