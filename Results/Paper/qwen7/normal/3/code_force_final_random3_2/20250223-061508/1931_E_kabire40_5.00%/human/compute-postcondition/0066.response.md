Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**
