Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `rev_val` must have at least 1 element.
- `x` is equal to `k + 1`.
- If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` with the string representation of `val_in`.
- Otherwise, `rev_res` is constructed as specified plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined by the variable `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `x = k + 1` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `k + 1`.

2. **Next Value of `x`:**
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, so `x` will become `k + 2`.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `x < len(rev_val)`.
   - Therefore, `x` must be less than `len(rev_val)` for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `x` will be `k + 2`.
   - `rev_val` must still have at least 1 element (this condition remains unchanged).
   - `rev_res` and `val_in` will be updated based on the value of `x` during the current iteration, but these updates will be specific to the current value of `x`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `rev_val` must have at least 1 element.
- `x` will be `k + 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is `k + 2`**.
