Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all elements a_i in the list. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1, `rev_res` will be a string that has been built by concatenating the string representations of integers when `x` is even and the reversed strings when `x` is odd, and `rev_val` will contain all its original elements as it was not modified within the loop. Additionally, the value of \(10^{int(max\_power)}\) will either be less than or greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)` depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `x % 2`: if `x % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` remains unchanged; otherwise, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and the reverse of the string at index `x - 1` in `rev_val`. Additionally, the condition \(10^{int(max_power)} < int(rev_res)\) is checked, and the program behaves according to the if and else parts as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rev_res` is a string constructed based on the elements of `rev_val` where for each index `x` (starting from 0 and going up to the length of `rev_val` minus 1), if `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. Additionally, the value of `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
