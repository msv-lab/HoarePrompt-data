Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`; `rev_val` is a list with one element which is the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of `x` (which is the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`) to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is the first element in `operational_list` converted to a string and then reversed, `rev_val` now contains this reversed string as its only element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
