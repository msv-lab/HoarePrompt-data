Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `k + 1`, `rev_res` is constructed as specified, and `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value at the index `x` of `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. Since `x` is defined as `k + 1`, `val_in` will be the element in `rev_val` at the position `k + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
