Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first two elements; `x` is the third element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; `rev_res` is incremented by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` simply adds the value of `x` to `rev_res`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rev_res`, we only know that `rev_res` has been incremented by `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
