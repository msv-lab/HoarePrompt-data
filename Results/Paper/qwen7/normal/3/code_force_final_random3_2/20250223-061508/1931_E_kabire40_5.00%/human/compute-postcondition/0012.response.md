Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string.
   - `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`.
   - If `len(str(x_rev)) == len(x)`, then `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list with one element which is the reverse of `x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the variable being iterated over, it will be set to the next element in `operational_list`.
   - `operational_list` will be the same list as before, but without the current `x` (the first element in the previous iteration).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `x` will be the second element in `operational_list`.
   - `operational_list` will be the original list minus the first element.

Given this, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `operational_list` remains the same list as before, but without the first element.
- `x` is now the second element in `operational_list`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element; `x` is the second element in the list**.
