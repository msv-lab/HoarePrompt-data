Postcondition: `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `k + 1`. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` with the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is constructed as specified plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.
