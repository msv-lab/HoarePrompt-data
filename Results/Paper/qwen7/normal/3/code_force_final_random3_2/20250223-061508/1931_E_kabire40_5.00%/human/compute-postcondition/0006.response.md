Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` takes the first element of the list `operational_list` (denoted as `x`), reverses it (`x[::-1]`), converts the reversed string to an integer (`int()`), and assigns this integer value to `x_rev`. All other elements in `operational_list` remain unchanged.
