Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed; `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order; `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together; `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`; `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`; `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the `rev_val` list in ascending order. Since `rev_val` was previously a list of reversed strings that did not have the same length as their original counterparts, sorting it does not change the content of the list but arranges the elements in ascending order based on their values. All other variables (`operational_list`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `y`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the sorting operation.
