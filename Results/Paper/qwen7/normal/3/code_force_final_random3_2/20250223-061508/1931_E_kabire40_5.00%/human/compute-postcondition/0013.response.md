Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element; `x` is the second element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer. The reversed string of `x` is then converted to an integer and assigned to `x_rev`. The values of `operational_list` and the original `x` remain unchanged.
