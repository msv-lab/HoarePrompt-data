Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from input split by space, `max_power` is the second value from input split by space, and `y` is equal to `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list. If the length of the reverse of `x` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by the integer value of the reverse of `x`. Otherwise, `x` is added to `rev_val` as a reversed string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list (after reversing it and converting to integer), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
