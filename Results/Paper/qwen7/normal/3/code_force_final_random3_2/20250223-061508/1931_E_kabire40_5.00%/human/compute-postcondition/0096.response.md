Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is now equal to `k + 1`, `len(rev_val)` remains the same, `rev_res` is updated by appending the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` to itself, `val_in` is assigned the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += str(val_in)` appends the string representation of `val_in` to `rev_res`. `val_in` is the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val`. Therefore, `rev_res` is updated by appending this integer value to itself. All other variables retain their previous values.
