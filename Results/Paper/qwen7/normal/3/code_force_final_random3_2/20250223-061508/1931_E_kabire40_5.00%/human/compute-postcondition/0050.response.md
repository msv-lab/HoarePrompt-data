Postcondition: **`x` will be equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1, `rev_res` will be a string that has been built by concatenating the string representations of integers when `x` is even and the reversed strings when `x` is odd, and `rev_val` will contain all its original elements as it was not modified within the loop. Additionally, the value of `10 ** int(max_power)` is less than the current value of `rev_res`.**
