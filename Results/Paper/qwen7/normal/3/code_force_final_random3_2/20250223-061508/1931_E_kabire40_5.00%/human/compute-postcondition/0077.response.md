Output State: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is not equal to the original string, `rev_res` is a string that contains the sum of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed string has the same length as the original string, and `y` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `operational_list` will be empty since all its elements have been processed. `rev_val` will contain all the reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string's length differs from the original string. `rev_res` will be a concatenated string of all elements from `operational_list` where the reversed string's length matches the original string. The variable `y` remains unaffected and retains its initial value.
