You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings and a list of integers. It constructs a new string by reversing some elements of the list based on their indices and then checks if a power of 10 (determined by one of the input strings) is greater than or equal to the numeric value of the constructed string. Depending on the result of this comparison, it prints either 'Anna' or 'Sasha'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the list of integers `a`.

2. **Reversing Elements:**
   - The program attempts to reverse the digits of each element in the list.
   - However, the implementation of reversing digits is flawed. Specifically:
     - It tries to append non-reversed numbers to `rev_res` if their length remains the same after reversal.
     - It appends reversed numbers to `rev_val` if their length changes.
     - This logic is incorrect because the problem requires Anna to reverse the digits of any chosen element, and the length should change accordingly.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts `rev_val` and then concatenates elements based on their index.
   - If the index is even, it appends the element as is.
   - If the index is odd, it appends the reversed element.
   - This part of the logic seems to be unrelated to the actual game rules and might be intended to simulate some aspect of the game, but it is not aligned with the problem statement.

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the resulting number is greater than \(10^m\).
   - If true, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Reversal Logic:** The program incorrectly handles the reversal of digits. It should reverse all digits of each element, regardless of the length change.
2. **Irrelevant Concatenation Logic:** The sorting and conditional concatenation do not align with the game rules.
3. **Winning Condition Check:** The check for winning condition is based on the final concatenated number, which is not how the game is supposed to work.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the game logic:
1. Reverse the digits of each element.
2. Determine the optimal strategy based on the game rules.
3. Check if Sasha can form a number >= \(10^m\) on his last turn.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
