Output State: **`operational_list` contains at least one fewer element, `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`, `x` is no longer defined**.

In this case, the code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x_rev` (which is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`) to `rev_res`. Since `x` is no longer defined, the only change is to `rev_res` which now includes the sum of its previous value and `x_rev`. The precondition that `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element remains unchanged.
