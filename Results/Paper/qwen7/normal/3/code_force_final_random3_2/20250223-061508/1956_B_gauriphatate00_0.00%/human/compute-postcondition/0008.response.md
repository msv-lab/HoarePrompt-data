Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `idx`, which is now one more than its previous value.
