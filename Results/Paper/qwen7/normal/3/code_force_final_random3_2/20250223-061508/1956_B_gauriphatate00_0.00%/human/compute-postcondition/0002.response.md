Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read()`**.

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
