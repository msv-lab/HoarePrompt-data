Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read()`, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`idx`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
