Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `results`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `results`:**
   - According to the given information, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended three times.
   - This implies that `results` must already contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the State of `result`:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, `result` will take on the values from `results` one by one.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - No other variables in the loop head need adjustment because they are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `results` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
