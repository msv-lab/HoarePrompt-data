You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by the total length of all lists `a` (which is 3 * n), plus 3 (for the increments and the initial value of `t`); `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended three times, with each `n` and corresponding `a` being derived from the slices of `data` as per the loop's logic; `n` is the last integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is the list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should still be greater than 0, `idx` will point to the position right after the last processed list `a`, `results` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, a)` three times, and `n` and `a` will be set based on the final iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` must contain exactly three elements, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` must point to the position right after the last processed list `a`, and `n` and `a` must be set based on the final iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with three variables: an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list. It returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
