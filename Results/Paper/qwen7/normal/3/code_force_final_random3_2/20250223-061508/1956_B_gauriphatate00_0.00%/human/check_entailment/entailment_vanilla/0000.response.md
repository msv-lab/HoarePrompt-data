Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `n`: Number of cards.
   - `a`: List of integers representing the numbers on the cards in your hand.

2. **Logic**:
   - Use `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - Calculate the number of pairs (each pair consists of two identical numbers).
   - Return the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into tokens.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, extracts `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Processing**:
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to `results`.
   - Prints each result.

### Problem Description Analysis

The problem states that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This implies that Nene will try to prevent you from scoring points whenever possible.

### Key Observations

1. **Pairs Calculation**: The function correctly counts the number of pairs (two identical numbers) in your hand.
2. **Optimal Play**: The function returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This logic aligns with the problem statement because:
   - If you have fewer than `n // 2` pairs, you can only score up to `n // 2` points (since Nene can block the remaining pairs).
   - If you have `n // 2` or more pairs, you can score up to `n // 2` points, but Nene can block the rest.

### Testing and Verification

Given the example provided in the problem statement, let's verify the function with the sample inputs:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `a = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Pairs: 1 (from `1, 1`)
  - Result: `min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`
  - Pairs: 2 (from `8, 8` and `5, 5`)
  - Result: `min(2, 8 // 2) = 2`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6]`
  - Pairs: 1 (from `4, 4`)
  - Result: `min(1, 8 // 2) = 1`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Pairs: 0
  - Result: `min(0, 3 // 2) = 0`

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 1`, `a = [1]`
  - Pairs: 0
  - Result: `min(0, 1 // 2) = 0`

All these results match the expected outputs provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.

**Correctness: True**
