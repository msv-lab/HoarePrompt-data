Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2*n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`; `results` is a list to which `func_1(n, a)` has been appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `idx`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `results` now contains the result of `func_1(n, a)`.
