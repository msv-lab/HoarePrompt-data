Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read()`, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2*n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`; `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 3 * n + 1, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2*n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`; `results` is a list to which `func_1(n, a)` has been appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
