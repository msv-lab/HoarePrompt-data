Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the maximum number of points you can get.
- **Logic**: 
  - The function uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
  - It calculates the number of pairs (integers with a count of exactly 2).
  - It returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and half the number of cards in your hand (`n // 2`).

#### Explanation:
- The number of pairs directly corresponds to the number of times you can score points because each pair represents a card that matches a card already on the table.
- However, the function also considers `n // 2`. This is because even if there are more pairs available, you can only score points if you can play those pairs within the limit of `n // 2` turns. This is because Nene will always try to minimize your score, and she will block you from scoring if possible.

Given this logic, `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get under the optimal play conditions.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: To process multiple test cases and call `func_1` for each test case.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Processes each test case by calling `func_1` and collecting the results.
  - Prints the results for each test case.

#### Explanation:
- The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case by calling `func_1` appropriately.
- It handles multiple test cases efficiently and prints the results as required.

Given this logic, `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` to get the desired output.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
