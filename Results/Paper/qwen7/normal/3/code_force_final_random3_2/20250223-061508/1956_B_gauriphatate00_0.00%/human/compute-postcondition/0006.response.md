Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given state before the loop, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for _ in range(t)` will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on `t` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The other variables (`idx`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
