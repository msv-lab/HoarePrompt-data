Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the optimal strategy of Nene. Instead, it simply calculates the minimum number of pairs of cards in the player's hand and assumes that Nene will always pair up cards to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. However, this approach does not consider the fact that Nene will strategically place cards on the table to prevent the player from scoring points.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  1 1 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided functions):
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the player has two cards with the number 1. If the player plays the first card with a 1, Nene can play the other card with a 1 immediately, preventing the player from scoring any points. Therefore, the player can only score at most 1 point. However, the provided function incorrectly returns 2, which is not the maximum number of points the player can achieve under optimal play.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the player, making it incorrect.
