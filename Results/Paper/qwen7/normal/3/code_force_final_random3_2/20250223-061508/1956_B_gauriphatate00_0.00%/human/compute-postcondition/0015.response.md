Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2 * n + 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]` converted from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.**

This means that the list `a` has been updated to contain integers derived from the slice of `data` starting from index `idx` and of length `n`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
