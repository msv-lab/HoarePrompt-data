### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Counter Calculation**:
   - `counter = Counter(a)` creates a frequency counter for the elements in `a`.
   - `pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))` counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

2. **Return Statement**:
   - `return min(pairs, n // 2)` returns the minimum value between the number of pairs (i.e., numbers appearing exactly twice) and half the number of cards `n`.

#### Function `func_2`
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `input = sys.stdin.read` reads the entire input as a single string.
   - `data = input().split()` splits the input string into a list of strings.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - `t = int(data[idx])` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`, then calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the result.

3. **Output**:
   - `results.append(func_1(n, a))` appends the result of `func_1` for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Nene always tries to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - If a number appears exactly twice, one copy will be placed on the table immediately, giving Nene a point.
   - To maximize your score, you should try to avoid giving Nene points as much as possible.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of pairs (numbers appearing exactly twice).
   - The return statement `min(pairs, n // 2)` ensures that you do not overestimate your potential score. Since Nene can block you by placing cards on the table, the actual number of points you can get is limited to half the number of cards you have (`n // 2`).

3. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The function correctly processes the input and handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of pairs (numbers appearing exactly twice) using a counter.
  - The return statement ensures that the result is capped at `n // 2`, which is a reasonable upper bound considering Nene's optimal strategy.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It uses `func_1` to compute the maximum points you can get for each test case.
  - The results are printed correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against Nene. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
