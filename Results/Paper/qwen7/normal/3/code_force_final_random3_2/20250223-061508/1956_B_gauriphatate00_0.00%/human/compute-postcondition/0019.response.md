Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

In this case, the code assigns an integer value from `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the new information is that `n` now holds an integer value from the specified index in the `data` list.
