Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2*n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`; `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of the function `func_1(n, a)` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `idx`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `idx` is increased by `2*n` are still valid. The list `a` is still obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`, and `results` now includes the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.
