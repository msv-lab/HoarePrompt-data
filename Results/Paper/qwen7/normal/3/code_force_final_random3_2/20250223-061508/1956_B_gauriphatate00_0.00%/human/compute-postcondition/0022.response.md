Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2*n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx:idx + n]`. After executing `idx += n`, `idx` is further increased by `n`, making it increased by `1 + n` in total, which can be simplified to `2*n`. The value of `a` remains unchanged because the slicing operation for obtaining `a` is based on the original `idx` and `idx + n`, and `idx` has only been updated, not the slicing range used to define `a`. Therefore, `a` is still a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`.
