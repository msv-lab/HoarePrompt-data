Based on the initial state provided, `results` must contain at least one element. However, the specific value of the element in `results` is not explicitly stated. Since we need to provide the most precise description possible, we can only say that `results` contains at least one element, but we cannot determine the exact value of the element without more information.

Given this, the print statement will output the first element of the `results` list, assuming it is accessed directly as `result`.

Output: **the first element of results**
