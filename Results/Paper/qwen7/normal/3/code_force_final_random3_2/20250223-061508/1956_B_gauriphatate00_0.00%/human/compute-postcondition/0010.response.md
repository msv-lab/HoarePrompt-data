Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2*n; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx:idx + n]`. After executing `idx += n`, the value of `idx` is further increased by `n`. Therefore, `idx` is increased by a total of `1 + n`, which can be expressed as `2*n`. Additionally, since `a` was defined based on the original `idx` and `idx + n`, updating `idx` means `a` now corresponds to `data[idx - n:idx]`.
