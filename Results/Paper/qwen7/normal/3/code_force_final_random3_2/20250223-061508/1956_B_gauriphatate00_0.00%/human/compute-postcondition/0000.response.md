Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Instead, it reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` method. This means that when input is called later in the program, it will read from standard input without prompting the user for input. However, since no actual input is taken or processed in the given code snippet, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
