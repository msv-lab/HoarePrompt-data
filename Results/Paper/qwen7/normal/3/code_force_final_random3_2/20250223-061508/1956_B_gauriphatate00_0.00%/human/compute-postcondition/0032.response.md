Output State: **`results` must contain exactly three elements, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` must point to the position right after the last processed list `a`, and `n` and `a` must be set based on the final iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain exactly three elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, a)` from the respective iteration. The variable `t` will still be greater than 0, indicating that the loop conditions were met throughout. The index `idx` will point to the position immediately following the last list `a` that was processed. Additionally, the values of `n` and `a` will be determined based on the final iteration of the loop.
