Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with three variables: an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list. It returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any parameters when called directly but operates on the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` which are expected to be defined before calling the function. The function processes the list `a` and the integers `t` and `n` to produce some output based on the given constraints.
