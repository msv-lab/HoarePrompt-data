Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. According to the problem description, a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the program generates strings using a pattern ('110') which does not guarantee that the generated string will have exactly `n` special characters.

For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. The program will output 'NO', but according to the problem description, it should generate a string like 'A' or 'B', which has exactly 1 special character (since it has no neighbors). The current implementation fails to handle this case correctly.
