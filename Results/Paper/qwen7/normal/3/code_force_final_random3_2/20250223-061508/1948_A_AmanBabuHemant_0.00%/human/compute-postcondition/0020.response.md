Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The input function waits for user input, which is then converted to an integer using `int()`. The initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged, and `n` is now an integer based on the user's input.
