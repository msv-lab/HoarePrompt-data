Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is '110' repeated `n // 2` times.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer representing half the value of `n`. The conditions on `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
