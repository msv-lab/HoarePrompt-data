The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be a positive integer.

Since `testcases` must remain a positive integer for the loop to continue, we cannot specify an exact value but must ensure it remains positive.

State: **`testcases` must be a positive integer**
