To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and ensure that the loop can continue based on those conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
   - This means for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `h`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `f` is the next value in the list `F`.
   - `l` is `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, otherwise `l` remains the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`.
   - `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false, otherwise `h` remains the same.
   - `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, we need `l < h`.
   - If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustments are needed.
   - If `l` is not less than `h`, we need to ensure that `l` becomes less than `h` in the next iteration.

### Determining Adjustments:

- **Condition for `l < h`**:
  - If `l` is not less than `h`, it means `l` has been set to `h` or `h` has been set to `l` due to the condition not being met.
  - To ensure `l < h` in the next iteration, we need to adjust either `l` or `h` such that `l` becomes less than `h`.

Given the current states:
- `l` is determined based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.
- `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false.

If `l` is not less than `h`, it implies that the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` was false, and `h` was adjusted to `mid`.

To ensure `l < h` in the next iteration, we need to adjust `l` to be less than `h`. Since `h` is currently `mid`, we can set `l` to be `mid + 1` to ensure `l < h`.

### Final State Adjustment:

- We need to ensure `l < h` for the loop to continue.
- If `l` is not less than `h`, we set `l` to `mid + 1` to ensure `l < h`.

Thus, the state adjustment required is:

**State: `f` is the next value in the list `F`, `l` must be `mid + 1` (if `l` is not less than `h`), `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false, otherwise `h` remains the same, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

This ensures that `l < h` for the next iteration of the loop.
