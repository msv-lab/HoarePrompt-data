Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop**: The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute at least once, this condition must be true.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `f` is the next value in the list `F`.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`.
   - `h` is the index obtained by subtracting 1 from the index where `right - f` would be inserted in list `D` using binary search (bisect_left).

4. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that `l < h` when the loop starts.
   - If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed.
   - If `l` is not less than `h`, we need to adjust either `l` or `h` to make `l < h` true.

Given the current states:
- `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`.
- `h` is the index obtained by subtracting 1 from the index where `right - f` would be inserted in list `D` using binary search.

For `l < h` to be true:
- `l` should be less than `h`.
- If `l` is not less than `h`, we need to adjust `l` or `h` to satisfy the condition.

Since the exact values of `l` and `h` are not provided, we can only ensure that the condition `l < h` holds true. Therefore, we need to adjust the states such that `l` is less than `h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`f` is the next value in the list `F`, `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index obtained by subtracting 1 from the index where `right - f` would be inserted in list `D` using binary search, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
