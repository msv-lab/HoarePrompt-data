Output State: **`f` is the next value in the list `F`; `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`; `h` is the index obtained by subtracting 1 from the index where `right - f` would be inserted in list `D` using binary search (bisect_left).**

This means that `f` remains the same as it was initially, `l` remains unchanged, and `h` is calculated as the index found by `bisect_left(D, right - f)` minus 1.
