Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, and `h` remains unchanged.**

This means that `mid_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`. The value of `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, while `l` and `h` remain unchanged.
