Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
