Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `mid` is either `mid + 1` or `h` depending on whether `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**
