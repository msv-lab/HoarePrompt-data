Postcondition: **`f` is the next value in the list `F`, `l` is `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, otherwise `l` remains the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`. `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false, otherwise `h` remains the same. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The overall postcondition ensures that either `l` is updated to `mid + 1` with the condition being met, or `h` is adjusted to `mid` with the condition not being met.**
