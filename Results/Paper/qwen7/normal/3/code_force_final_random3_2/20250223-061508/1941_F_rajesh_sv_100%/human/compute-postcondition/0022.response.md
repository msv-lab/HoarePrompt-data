Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is as before, `next_max_diff` is as before, `index` is as before, `n` must be greater than 4**.

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 5. The variable `diff` has been updated to the difference between `A[5]` and `A[4]`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
