Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is the integer part of `(l + h) / 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Since the current value of `l` is equal to `h`, no changes are made to `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` other than their definitions remain valid.
