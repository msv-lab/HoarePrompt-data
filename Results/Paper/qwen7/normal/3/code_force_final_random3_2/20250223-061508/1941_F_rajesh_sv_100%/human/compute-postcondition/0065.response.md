Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is greater than `l`**.

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `mid_sum` is still `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is still `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is still updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `h` must still be greater than `l`.
