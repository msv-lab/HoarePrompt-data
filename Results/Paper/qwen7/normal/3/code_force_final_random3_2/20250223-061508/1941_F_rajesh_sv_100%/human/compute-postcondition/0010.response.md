Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but relies on variables set by external functions (`testcases`, `a`, `d`, and `f`). It iterates `testcases` times, calling `func_6()` each time. After completing the iterations, `testcases` is reduced to zero, and `func_6()` has been called exactly `testcases` times. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to validate the input constraints through the calls to `func_6()`.**
