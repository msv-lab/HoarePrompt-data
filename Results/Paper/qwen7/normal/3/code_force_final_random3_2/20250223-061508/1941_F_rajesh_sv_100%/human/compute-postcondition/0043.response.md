Output State: **`max_diff` holds the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second maximum difference found, `index` holds the index of the element where `max_diff` was found (or `None` if no valid `max_diff` was found), `i` is equal to `n`, `diff` is not defined, `left` is equal to `A[index - 1]`, `right` is equal to `A[index], `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max_diff` assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
