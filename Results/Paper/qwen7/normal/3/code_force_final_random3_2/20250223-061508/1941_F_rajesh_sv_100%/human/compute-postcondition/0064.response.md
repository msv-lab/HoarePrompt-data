Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `h` must be greater than `l`**

Explanation: The code reassigns `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` using the current values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`. It also updates `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`, while keeping `l` unchanged and ensuring that `h` is still greater than `l`.
