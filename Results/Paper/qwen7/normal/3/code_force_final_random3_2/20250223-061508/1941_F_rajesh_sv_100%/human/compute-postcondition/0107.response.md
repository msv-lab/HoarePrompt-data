Output State: **`f` is the next value in the list `F`; `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `left - f` in the sorted list `D`. This insertion point is the smallest index `i` such that `D[i] > left - f`. After executing this line, the value of `f` remains unchanged, but `l` is assigned the index found by the `bisect_right` function.
