Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the new value of `mid` by using the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`. This value is derived from the current values of `l` and `h`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
