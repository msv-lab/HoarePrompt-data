Output State: **`ans` is math.factorial(n), `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`**.

The code calculates the factorial of `n` and assigns it to `ans`. The values of `k`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
