Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value in the list `a` to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
