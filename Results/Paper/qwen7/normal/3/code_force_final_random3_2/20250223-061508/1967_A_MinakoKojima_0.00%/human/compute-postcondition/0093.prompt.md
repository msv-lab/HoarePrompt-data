Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type initially.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is either `math.factorial(n)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is the product of differences between consecutive elements from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. This means that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as the product of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
