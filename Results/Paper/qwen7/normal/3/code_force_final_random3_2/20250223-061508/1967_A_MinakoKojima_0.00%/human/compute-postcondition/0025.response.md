Output State: **`ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by multiplying its current value with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is used in the multiplication. The value of `i` remains `n` after the operation. The initial state of `ans` being updated to its current value multiplied by `a[n] - a[n - 1]` is preserved.
