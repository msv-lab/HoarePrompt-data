Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. It does not affect the values of `a` or `m`, nor does it change the value of `ans`. The precondition that `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated according to the rule given in the initial state.
