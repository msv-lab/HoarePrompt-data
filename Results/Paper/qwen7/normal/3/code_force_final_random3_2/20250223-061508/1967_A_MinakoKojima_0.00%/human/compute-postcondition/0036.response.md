Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `a` is now a list of integers from the input split and converted, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `m = min(a)` assigns the minimum value of the list `a` to the variable `m`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `m` is now the minimum value in the list `a`.
