Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). For each set, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**
