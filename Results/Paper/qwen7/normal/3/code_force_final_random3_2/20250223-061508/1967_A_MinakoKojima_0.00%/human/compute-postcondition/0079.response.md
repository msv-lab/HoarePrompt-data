Output State: `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[j]) for j in range(n))`, `a[j]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[j])` for each `j` in range(n).

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to 0. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of `min(k, m + k // n - a[j])` for each iteration `j` from 0 to `n-1`. Each element `a[j]` will be updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[j])` during its respective iteration.
