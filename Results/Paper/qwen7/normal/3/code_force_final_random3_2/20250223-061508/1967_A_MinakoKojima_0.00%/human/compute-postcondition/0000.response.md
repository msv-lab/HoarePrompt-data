Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since `_` is just a dummy variable, its value doesn't matter for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and this value will determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined within the given range, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the State**: The state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `int(input())` will indeed return a value within this range.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is simply ensuring that the input value matches the range of `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**.

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected, since `int(input())` will return a value within the specified range.
