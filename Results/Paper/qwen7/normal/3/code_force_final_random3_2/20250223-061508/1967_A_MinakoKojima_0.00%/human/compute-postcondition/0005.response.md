Postcondition: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`. The condition k is greater than or equal to n times m holds true.**
