Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. Since `y` is `x - 1`, `current_sum` becomes `gcd_val + (x - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
