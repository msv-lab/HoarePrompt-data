Output State: **`max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` is defined as `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is now also `gcd_val + y`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
