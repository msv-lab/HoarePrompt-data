Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is 2, `gcd_val` is calculated as `math.gcd(x, 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is 1, the GCD of any number `x` (which is at least 2) and 1 is always 1. Therefore, `gcd_val` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
