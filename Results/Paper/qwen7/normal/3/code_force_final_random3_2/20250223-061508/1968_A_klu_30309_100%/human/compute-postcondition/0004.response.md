Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `y` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):` will start executing if the range defined by `range(x - 1, 0, -1)` is valid.
   - For the range to be valid, `x - 1` should be greater than or equal to 0 (since the range is inclusive of the start value and exclusive of the stop value).

3. **Check the given state**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `max_sum` is 0.
   - `best_y` is 1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop depends on `x` and `y`. We need to ensure that the range `range(x - 1, 0, -1)` is valid.
   - For the range to be valid, `x - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Since `best_y` is initially set to 1, the loop will start with `y = x - 1`, and as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute starting from `y = x - 1` down to `y = 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `y` is initialized to `x - 1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is initialized to `x - 1`**
