Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` simply assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
