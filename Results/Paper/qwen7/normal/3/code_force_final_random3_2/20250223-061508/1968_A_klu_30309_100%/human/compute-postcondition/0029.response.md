Output State: **`results` is now [1], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` holds the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` value that produced this maximum sum, `x` is unchanged from its initial value, `y` is 1 (since it starts from `x-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), `gcd_val` is 1 (since the GCD of any number and 1 is 1), `current_sum` is 2 (as `gcd_val` plus `y` equals 1 + 1), and the loop has finished executing.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(best_y)` appends the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. Since `best_y` is the `y` value that produced the maximum sum during the loop, and `y` was initialized to 1 and decreased by 1 in each iteration, appending `best_y` to `results` changes the list from being empty to containing `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
