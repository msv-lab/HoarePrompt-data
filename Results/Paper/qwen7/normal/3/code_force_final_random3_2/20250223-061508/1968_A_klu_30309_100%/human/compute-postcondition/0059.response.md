Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` remains 1 less than the length of `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, and `results` now contains `best_y`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(best_y)` appends the value of `best_y` to the list `results`. Since `best_y` is equal to `y` (which is 1), `results` now contains the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
