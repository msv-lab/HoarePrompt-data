Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is 1, and `results` now contains 1**

Explanation: The code `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `best_y`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
