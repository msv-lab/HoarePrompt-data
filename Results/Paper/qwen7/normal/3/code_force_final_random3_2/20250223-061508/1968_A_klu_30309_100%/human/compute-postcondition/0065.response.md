Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `best_y` is 1, and `results` now contains 1**

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be `gcd_val + y`. Given the initial state, `gcd_val` is 1 and `y` is 1, so `current_sum` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
