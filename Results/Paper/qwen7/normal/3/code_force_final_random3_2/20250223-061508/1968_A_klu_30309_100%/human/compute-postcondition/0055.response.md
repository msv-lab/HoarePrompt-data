Output State: **`max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`.**

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` simply assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. Since no other operations or changes are made to the variables, all the initial conditions and values remain unchanged.
