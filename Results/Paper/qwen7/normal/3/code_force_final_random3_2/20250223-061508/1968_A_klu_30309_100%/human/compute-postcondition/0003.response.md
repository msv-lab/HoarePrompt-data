Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `best_y` is assigned the value 1. The values of `results` and `max_sum` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `t` also remains within its specified range.
