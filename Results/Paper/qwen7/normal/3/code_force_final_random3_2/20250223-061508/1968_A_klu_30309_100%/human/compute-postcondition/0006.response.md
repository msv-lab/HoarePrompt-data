Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `current_sum` the value of `gcd_val + y`. Since `y` is already defined as `x - 1`, `current_sum` becomes `gcd_val + (x - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
