Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for `t` and `n`.**

This means the function is designed to work with two integers, `t` and `n`, which are not passed as parameters to the function itself but are presumably provided elsewhere in the context of its usage. The function will return a value (though the specific value or condition for returning it is not detailed here) based on the constraints that `t` must be between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` must be between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
