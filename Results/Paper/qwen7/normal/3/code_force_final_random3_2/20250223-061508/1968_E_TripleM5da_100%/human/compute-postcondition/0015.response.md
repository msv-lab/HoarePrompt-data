Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is defined by the `range(0, int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for each integer from 0 up to but not including the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Current Iteration**: In the current iteration, `i` is 6. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjusting States**: We need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (from 6 to 7) and `n` must remain greater than or equal to 7 (since `i` starts from 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains unchanged (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)
- `i` is now 7
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 7

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 7, `n` must be greater than or equal to 7**
