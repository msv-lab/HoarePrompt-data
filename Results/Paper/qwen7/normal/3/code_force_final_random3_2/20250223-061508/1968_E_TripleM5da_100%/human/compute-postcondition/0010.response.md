Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(3, n + 1)`. This means \(3 \leq i \leq n\).

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the loop will continue as long as `i` is still within the range and `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to continue, `i` will increment by 1, making it 5.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is \(3 \leq i \leq n\). Since `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is now 5.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5**
