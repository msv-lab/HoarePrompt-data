### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The provided program attempts to achieve this by printing specific coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - Then, it prints coordinates of the form `(i, i)` for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of `n`**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 4, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 7, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 10, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The output is:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       3 3
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       7 7
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) has size 13, which is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly generates the required coordinates to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for different values of \( n \).

However, upon closer inspection, the program does not always generate the optimal set of coordinates to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Specifically, the program only prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((i, i)\) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \). This approach does not necessarily cover all possible Manhattan distances for larger values of \( n \).

For example, consider \( n = 4 \):
- The output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```
- The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). However, the optimal solution should include the pair \((1, 3)\) to achieve the full set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

Similarly, for \( n = 5 \):
- The output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  5 5
  ```
- The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\). The optimal solution should include the pair \((1, 3)\) and \((2, 5)\) to achieve the full set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\).

Therefore, the program does not always generate the optimal set of coordinates to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
