Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 2 * n - 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 3 to `n + 2` (since the loop runs from 3 to `n` inclusive and increments `i` by 1 each time). Therefore, `i` will be `n + 2`, which can be rewritten as `2 * n - 1` since `i` starts at 3 and increases by 1 each iteration. The variable `n` must be at least 11 for the loop to run the maximum number of times required to reach `i = 2 * n - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
