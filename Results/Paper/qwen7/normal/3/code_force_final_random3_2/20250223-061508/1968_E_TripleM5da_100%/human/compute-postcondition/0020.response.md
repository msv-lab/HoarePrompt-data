Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 50.
2. The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 7.
3. The variable `n` is mentioned to be greater than or equal to 7, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

This statement will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly defined as 7, both instances of `i` in the print statement will be replaced with 7.

Output: **7 7**
