Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program generates a specific pattern of points: 
   - It always starts with the points (1, 1) and (1, 2).
   - Then it prints points (i, i) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\).

3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances generated by this pattern:
   - The distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The distance between (1, 1) and (i, i) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
   - The distance between (1, 2) and (i, i) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-2)\).

4. For \(n \geq 3\), the distances generated are:
   - 1 (from (1, 1) to (1, 2))
   - 2, 4, 6, ..., 2(n-1) (from (1, 1) to (3, 3), (4, 4), ..., (n, n))
   - 2, 4, 6, ..., 2(n-2) (from (1, 2) to (3, 3), (4, 4), ..., (n, n))

5. This pattern ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all even numbers from 2 up to 2(n-1) and the number 1. Therefore, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) for even \(n\) and \(\frac{n+1}{2}\) for odd \(n\), which is maximized by this configuration.

6. Given the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\), this pattern will indeed maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all valid \(n\).

Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \(n\) within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
