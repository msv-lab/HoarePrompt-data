Based on the initial state provided, there are no variables or objects defined other than the print statement itself. The print statement simply prints the value of the variable `i` twice. Since no value for `i` is explicitly given, we cannot determine its value from the information provided.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **i i** (where `i` is the value of the variable `i`)
