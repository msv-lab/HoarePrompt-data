Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive). This means `i` will take on values from 3 to `n` in each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 3, this is the initial value of `i` when the loop begins its first iteration.

4. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 because the smallest value `i` can take is 3.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
- The variable `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state should include:
- `t` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` must be at least 3.

So, the final state is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` must be at least 3**
