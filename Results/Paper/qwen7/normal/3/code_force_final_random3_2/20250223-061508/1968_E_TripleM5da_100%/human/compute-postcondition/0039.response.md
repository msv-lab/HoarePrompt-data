Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 11, `n` must be at least 11.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 1 for each iteration, starting from 3 up to `n`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 10, meaning `n` must be at least 10. For the loop to complete all its iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `n + 2`, which is 11 in this case, given that `n` is at least 11. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
