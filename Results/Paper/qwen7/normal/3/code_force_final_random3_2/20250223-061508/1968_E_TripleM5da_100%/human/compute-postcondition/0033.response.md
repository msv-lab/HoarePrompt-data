Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `i` is explicitly given as 8.
- `n` must be at least 8, but its exact value is not specified and does not affect the print statement.

The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly given as 8, the output will be:

Output: **8 8**
