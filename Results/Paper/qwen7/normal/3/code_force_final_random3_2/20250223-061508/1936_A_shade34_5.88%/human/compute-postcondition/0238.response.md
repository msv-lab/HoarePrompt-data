Output State: **`pans` must have at least 2 elements**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the value of `pans`. It flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`, which means any buffered data is immediately written to the terminal or file. However, since the initial state only specifies that `pans` must have at least 2 elements, and no changes are made to `pans` by the code, the value of `pans` remains unchanged.
