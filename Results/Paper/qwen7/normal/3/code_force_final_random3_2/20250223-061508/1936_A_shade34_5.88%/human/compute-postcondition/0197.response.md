Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is being initialized to `n-1` and will be incremented in each iteration.
   - `n`: This variable must be at least 3 as given in the initial state.

2. **Determine the Initial State for `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to start executing, `i` should be within the range specified by `range(n)`. Since `range(n)` generates values from `0` to `n-1`, `i` must be between `0` and `n-1` inclusive. Given that `i` starts at `n-1`, the loop will start executing if `n > 0`.

3. **Initial State for `n`**: It is already given that `n` must be at least 3.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`mak2`, `pans`, `mak`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be `n-1`.
- `n` should be at least 3.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 3**
