Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the string input by the user and is reassigned to a new string input by the user, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If the input string `s` equals `"="<`, then `pans` will contain the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.
