Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the string input by the user**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the initial conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified, the values of `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
