Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1`, `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())**.

Explanation: The code snippet updates the list `pans` to contain only the element `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
