Output State: **`pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i`, the user has entered a string which is equal to '>' and this string is stored in a new variable.**

The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we only know that `mak` now holds the value of `i`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
