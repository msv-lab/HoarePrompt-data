Output State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `mak2 = mak` assigns the current value of `mak` (which is `n`) to `mak2`. This means `mak2` now holds the same value as `mak`, which is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
