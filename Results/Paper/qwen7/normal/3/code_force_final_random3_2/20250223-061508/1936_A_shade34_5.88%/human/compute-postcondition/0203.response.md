Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the string input by the user with current value '<', `mak` is equal to `i`, `pans` is a list containing `[i]`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `pans` as a list containing the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n-1`, the list `pans` now contains `[n-1]`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `mak` remain unchanged from their initial states.
