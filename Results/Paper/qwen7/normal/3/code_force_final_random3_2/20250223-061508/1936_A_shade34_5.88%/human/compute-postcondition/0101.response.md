Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`
   - `s` is the string `'>', n` if the input is `<`, otherwise it is the same as above.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is the input integer

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be set to `n` (since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration).

6. **Update other relevant variables**:
   - `mak` remains `i`, which is now `n`.
   - `mak2` remains `n-1`.
   - `pans` remains the same list `[n-1, n-1, n]`.
   - `s` remains the same string `'>', n` if the input is `<`, otherwise it is the same as above.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` if the input is `<`, otherwise it is the same as above.**
