Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n`
- `mak2` is `n`
- `i` is 1
- `pans` is either `['0']` or `[0]` (both representations are equivalent in Python)
- `s` is the string entered by the user
- `n` is the input integer from the user

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is `n`.
- `mak2` is `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak2` is `n`.

So, the print statement will output these values in the order they appear.

Output: **'? n n 1 n'**
