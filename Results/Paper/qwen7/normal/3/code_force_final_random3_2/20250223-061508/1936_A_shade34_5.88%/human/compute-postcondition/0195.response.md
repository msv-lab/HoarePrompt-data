Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is `n-1`, and `k` is `k-n+2`.**

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, `mak2` now holds the same value as `mak`, which is `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
