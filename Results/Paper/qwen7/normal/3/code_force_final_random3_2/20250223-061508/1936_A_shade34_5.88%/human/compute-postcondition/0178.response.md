Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is 1, and `k` is `k-1`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 1, to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `n` must still be at least 3, `pans` is still a list of length `n`, `mak` is now 1, and `k` is still `k-1`.
