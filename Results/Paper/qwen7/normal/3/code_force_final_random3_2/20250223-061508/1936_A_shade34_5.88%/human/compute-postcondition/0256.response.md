Based on the initial state provided:

- `pans` contains the original list of values from `n-1` down to `0`.
- `mak` is equal to the last value of `i` that was set within the loop, which would be `len(pans) - 1`.
- `mak2` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is not clear if it is a typo or a different variable. Given the context, it seems `mak2` might be intended to be `mak`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('!', mak2, mak)` will print:

- The string `!`
- The value of `mak`, which is `len(pans) - 1`

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **! len(pans) - 1**
