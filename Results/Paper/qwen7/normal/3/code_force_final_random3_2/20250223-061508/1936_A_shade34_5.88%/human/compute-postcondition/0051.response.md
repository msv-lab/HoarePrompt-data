Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, which is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `n-1` and `i` (which is `n-1`).
   - `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - If `s` is equal to `'<'`, `pans` remains unchanged.
   - If `s` is equal to `'='`, no changes are made to the variables.
   - Otherwise, the variables remain in their original state.

4. **Determine the new state after the loop**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `mak2` and `mak` will still be `n-1`.
   - `pans` will still contain `n-1` and `n-1`.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is determined by user input and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, which is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1` and `n-1`, and `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`.**
