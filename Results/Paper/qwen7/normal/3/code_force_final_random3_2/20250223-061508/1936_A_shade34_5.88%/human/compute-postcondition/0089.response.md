Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is `n - 1`
- `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`
- `s` is the string `'>', n` (though this variable is not used in the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `mak` is again 0.
- `i` is within the range `[1, n-1]`, but its exact value is not specified, so we'll just denote it as `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 0 i i'**
