Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 3 but its exact value is not specified.
- `pans` is a list of length `n`.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is `k-1`, but since `k` is not initialized or given any explicit value, we only know it is derived from another value of `k` which is not provided. However, this does not affect the values of `mak` and `i`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given the values:
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The print statement will output:
Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
