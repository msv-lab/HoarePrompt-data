Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\) and can be queried through bitwise operations using at most \(3n\) interactions.**
