Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `n`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n`
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`
   - `s` is the string '>'
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is `n` and the loop continues if `i` is less than `len(pans)`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next element in `pans`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n + 1`.
   - `len(pans)` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `mak` remains `n`
   - `mak2` remains `n-1`
   - `i` becomes `n + 1`
   - `pans` remains the same (a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`)
   - `s` remains the string '>'
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` will be executed again

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string '>', and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**
