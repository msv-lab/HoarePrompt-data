Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `n`
   - `mak2` is `n`
   - `i` is either 0 or 1
   - `pans` is either `['0']` or `[0]`
   - `s` is the string entered by the user
   - `n` is the input integer from the user
   - If `s` is '<', then `i` is 0 and `pans` is `['0']`; otherwise, `i` is 1 and `pans` is `[0]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` can only be 0 or 1, after each iteration, `i` will increment by 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 0, it will become 1; if `i` was 1, it will exceed `n` (since `n` is the same as the initial value of `i`), and the loop will terminate.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `mak` and `mak2` remain the same.
- `pans` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.

Since `i` can only be 0 or 1, and it will become 1 in the next iteration, the new state will be:

State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 1, `pans` is either `['0']` or `[0]`, `s` is the string entered by the user, and `n` is the input integer from the user.**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 1, `pans` is either `['0']` or `[0]`, `s` is the string entered by the user, and `n` is the input integer from the user.**
