Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `mak` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `n-1` and `n-1`.
   - `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state:
- `mak2` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is also `n-1`, so `mak2` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak2` is again `n-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string).
- `mak` which is `n-1`.
- `mak2` which is `n-1`.
- `i` which is `n`.
- `mak2` which is `n-1`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n n-1'**
