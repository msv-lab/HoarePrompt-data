Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print a string followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, repeated twice. Specifically, it will print:
- A question mark (`?`)
- The value of `mak` (which is 1), twice
- The value of `i` (which is 2), twice

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 1 2 2'**
