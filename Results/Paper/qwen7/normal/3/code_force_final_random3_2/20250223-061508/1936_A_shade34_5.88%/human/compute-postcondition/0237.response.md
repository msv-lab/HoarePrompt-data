Based on the initial state and the given code snippet:

- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- The indices `mak` and `i` are used in the print statement, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

Given this information, we cannot determine the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` without knowing the specific values assigned to `mak` and `i`. Therefore, the output will include placeholders for these values.

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
