Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently `2`.
   - `pans` is a list of length `n`.
   - If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` is `2`; otherwise, `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `3`.
   - The length of `pans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `mak` remains unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, and if the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.**
