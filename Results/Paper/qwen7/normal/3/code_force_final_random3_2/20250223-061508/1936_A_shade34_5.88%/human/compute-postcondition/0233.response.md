Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration and the current value of `i`, which is `n + 1`. If `s` equals `<`, `mak` is set to `i`; if `s` equals `=`, then `s` is unchanged, and `pans` includes the current value of `i`.
