Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it is used in the loop definition.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start with `i = n-1`, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` initially. This means `n` must be greater than `n-1`, which is always true. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, so `n` should be at least 1.
   - `i` is already set to `n-1`, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, which is `n-1`.
   - `mak` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is an empty list (no adjustment needed here).
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1**.
