Output State: **`c` is 'z', and `decoded` is a list containing the last character 'z'**.

Explanation: The variable `c` iterates through all characters from 'a' to 'z'. For each character, the program checks if it is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. If the condition is met, the loop breaks. After 26 iterations, `c` becomes 'z'. The line `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character 'z' to the list `decoded`. Since the loop completes without finding any new unique characters in the range from 'a' to 'z', `decoded` contains only one element, which is 'z'.
