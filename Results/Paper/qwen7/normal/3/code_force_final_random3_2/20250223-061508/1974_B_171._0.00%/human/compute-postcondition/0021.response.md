Output State: `decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the value `'a'`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character from 'a' to 'z'. For each character `c`, it checks if `chr(c)` (which is the character itself) is not in the values of `mapping`. If this condition is true, it adds the character `chr(c)` as a key to the `mapping` dictionary with the value `'a'`. Since the loop continues to add each character from 'a' to 'z' in sequence and the condition is always true initially, the `mapping` dictionary will contain all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the value `'a'`. The `decoded` list remains empty as it is not modified within the loop.
