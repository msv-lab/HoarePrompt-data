Output State: **`decoded` is a list containing one additional element `'mapping[char]'`, `mapping` remains unchanged, `encoded` is a string with at least one character remaining, and `char` is the next character in `encoded` after appending `'mapping[char]'` to `decoded`.**

This means that the `decoded` list now has one more element, which is `'mapping[char]'`. The `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged, `encoded` still has at least one character left, and `char` is updated to be the next character in the `encoded` string.
