Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` attempts to map characters from the encoded string back to the original characters, but it incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string to 'a' instead of finding the corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r` and performing the symmetric replacement.

According to the problem, the auxiliary string `r` should consist of all distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically. Then, each character in the encoded string should be replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

However, the current implementation does not construct the auxiliary string `r` and does not perform the symmetric replacement correctly. Instead, it tries to find the first unused lowercase letter and maps it to 'a', which is not the intended behavior.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
