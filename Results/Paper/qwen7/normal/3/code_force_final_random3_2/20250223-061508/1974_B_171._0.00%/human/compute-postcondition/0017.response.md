Output State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing the key `'b'` with the value `'a'`, and `chr(c)` is mapped to `char` in the dictionary.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` attempts to map `chr(c)` to `char` in the dictionary `mapping`. However, since `c` and `char` are not defined in the given context, we cannot determine their specific values. Therefore, the mapping operation is performed, but the exact values of `c` and `char` remain unspecified. The other variables (`decoded` and `mapping`) retain their initial states.
