Output State: `decoded` is a list containing all characters from the `encoded` string, where each character is mapped according to the rules defined in the loop. `mapping` is a dictionary that contains all lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') as keys, each mapped to the character 'a'. The `encoded` string remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every character in the `encoded` string has been processed. If a character was already present in the `mapping` dictionary, its corresponding value (as per the dictionary) is appended to `decoded`. If a character was not in `mapping`, the loop finds the first unused lowercase letter (starting from 'a') and maps it to the current character, then appends this letter to `decoded`. By the end of the loop, `decoded` will contain a sequence of characters based on these mappings, and `mapping` will have all possible lowercase letters mapped to 'a'.
