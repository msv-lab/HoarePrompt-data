The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced with the letter 'a', based on a specific mapping rule. If a character in `encoded` is already mapped to 'a' in the dictionary, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, the function finds the first unused lowercase letter and maps it to 'a', then replaces the character in `encoded` with 'a'.
