#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of encoded is at most 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the described algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: `decoded` is a list containing all characters from the `encoded` string, where each character is mapped according to the rules defined in the loop. `mapping` is a dictionary that contains all lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') as keys, each mapped to the character 'a'. The `encoded` string remains unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every character in the `encoded` string has been processed. If a character was already present in the `mapping` dictionary, its corresponding value (as per the dictionary) is appended to `decoded`. If a character was not in `mapping`, the loop finds the first unused lowercase letter (starting from 'a') and maps it to the current character, then appends this letter to `decoded`. By the end of the loop, `decoded` will contain a sequence of characters based on these mappings, and `mapping` will have all possible lowercase letters mapped to 'a'.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string composed of characters derived from the `encoded` string, where each character is mapped to 'a' according to the rules defined in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced with the letter 'a', based on a specific mapping rule. If a character in `encoded` is already mapped to 'a' in the dictionary, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, the function finds the first unused lowercase letter and maps it to 'a', then replaces the character in `encoded` with 'a'.
