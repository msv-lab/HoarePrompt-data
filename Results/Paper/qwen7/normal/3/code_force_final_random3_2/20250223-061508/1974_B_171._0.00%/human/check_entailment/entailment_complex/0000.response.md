Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the goal is to decode the `encoded` string back to the original string `s`. However, the function currently maps each character in the `encoded` string to the letter 'a', regardless of the original mapping defined during the encoding process.

In the encoding process, each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters string `r`. For example, if `r` is "cdefors", then 'c' in `s` would be replaced by 's', 'o' by 'e', and so on. The function should reverse this process to decode the string.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not maintain any state of the original mapping from `r` to the characters in `encoded`. Instead, it simply maps every character to 'a', which is incorrect.

Therefore, the function does not perform the required decoding operation.

Correctness: **False**
