Output State: **`ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2`, `x` is `x + 2`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state where `x` is `x + 1`, after executing the code, `x` becomes `x + 2`. The other variables (`ans`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
