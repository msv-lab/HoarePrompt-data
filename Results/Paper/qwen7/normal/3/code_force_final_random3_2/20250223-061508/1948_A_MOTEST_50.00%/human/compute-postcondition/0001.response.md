Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, s is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and os.system('cls') has been called.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `string.ascii_uppercase`, which is a string containing all uppercase letters from A to Z. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `os.system('cls')` has already been called, so its state is also preserved.
