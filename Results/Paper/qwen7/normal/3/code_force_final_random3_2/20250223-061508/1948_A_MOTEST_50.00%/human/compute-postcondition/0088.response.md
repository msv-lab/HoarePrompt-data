Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `j < n // 2`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `ans` is 's[0]*2' + 's[1]*2'.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body (based on the given information).
   - The variables `x` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

5. **New States**:
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `j` must be 2.
   - `x` remains 2.
   - `ans` remains 's[0]*2' + 's[1]*2'.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `x` is 2, `ans` is 's[0]*2' + 's[1]*2'**
