Output State: **`ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `s` remains unchanged**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state includes `ans` being increased by `2 * s[x]`, `x` being increased by 1, `j` being increased by 1, and `s` remaining unchanged.
2. The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1.
3. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the code, `x` is increased by 1, while `ans`, `j`, and `s` retain their original relationships and values from the initial state.
