Output State: **`n` is an odd number and at least 3, `j` is 2, `ans` is 'AAASSSS', `x` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3, and assuming `s` is 'AAASSS' (since `ans` is initially 'AAASSS'), appending twice the character at index 3 (which is 'S') to `ans` results in 'AAASSSS'. The values of `n`, `j`, and `x` remain unchanged.
