Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.
2. It checks if `n` is 1 and prints 'NO' if true, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. For `n > 1`, the program attempts to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters. However, the logic for constructing the string has some issues:
   - When `n` is even, the program correctly pairs characters from the alphabet to form the string.
   - When `n` is odd, the program starts with 'AAA' and then pairs the remaining characters, which might not always result in a string where exactly `n` characters are special.
4. The program does not ensure that the constructed string will have exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n` is odd and greater than 3, the initial 'AAA' will already have 3 special characters, and the remaining characters may not form a string with exactly `n` special characters.
5. The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when `n` is very close to the maximum limit (50), and the constructed string might exceed the required number of special characters.

Given these points, the program does not guarantee that the constructed string will have exactly `n` special characters for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
