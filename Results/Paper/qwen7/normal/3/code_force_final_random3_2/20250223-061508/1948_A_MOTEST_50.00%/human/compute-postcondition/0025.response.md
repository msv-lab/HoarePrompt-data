Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `s` and `x` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to its current value. However, since the initial values of `ans`, `s`, and `x` are not specified, we can only say that `ans` is updated accordingly, while `s` and `x` remain unchanged.
