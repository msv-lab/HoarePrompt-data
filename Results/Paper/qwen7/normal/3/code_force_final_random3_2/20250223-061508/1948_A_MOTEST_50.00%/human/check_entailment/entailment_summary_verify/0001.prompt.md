You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and then `t` integers `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`. The function does not return any value but prints output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console, which is not necessary for solving the problem and could be removed.
   - It imports `string` and defines a function `func()`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Calculation:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
   - Otherwise, it attempts to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` starting from 0.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating pairs of different characters from the uppercase alphabet.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with "AAA" and then continues constructing the string similarly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.
   - If the constructed string does not meet the requirement, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - When `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA". This means the first three characters are always 'A', which violates the condition that a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, the initial approach for odd `n` is flawed.

2. **String Length Constraint:**
   - The problem specifies that the string length should be at most 200. However, the current logic might generate strings longer than 200, especially when `n` is large.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the constructed string exceeds the maximum allowed length of 200.

### Corrected Approach

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the constructed string meets the special character requirement and does not exceed the length limit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] + s[(x + 1) % 26]
                    x += 1
            else:
                # Ensure the string does not exceed 200 characters
                while len(ans) < 200 and len(ans) < n:
                    ans += s[x] + s[(x + 1) % 26]
                    x += 1
                if len(ans) < n:
                    ans += s[x]
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical flaws, particularly in handling odd `n` values and ensuring the string length constraint. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected.
