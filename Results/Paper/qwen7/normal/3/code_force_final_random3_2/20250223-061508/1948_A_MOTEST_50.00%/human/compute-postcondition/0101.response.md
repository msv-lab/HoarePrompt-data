Output State: **`n` is an odd number and at least 3; `j` is 1; `ans` is 'AAASSS'; `x` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` in the string `s` to `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, it appends `s[2] * 2` to `ans`. Since `ans` was originally 'AAAS', appending `s[2] * 2` (which is `s[2]` repeated twice) changes `ans` to 'AAASSS'. All other variables remain unchanged.
