Reasoning:
- The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which matches the problem statement.
- For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into a list `a`.
- It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each unique stick length.
- Then, it iterates over the values in the dictionary, calculating how many complete polygons (with 3 or 4 sides) can be formed using the sticks of each length.
- Specifically, for each count `x` of a stick length, it adds `x // 4` to the answer `ans`, which correctly accounts for forming triangles (3 sides) and squares (4 sides).
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
