Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list of integers a_i.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each starting with an integer `t` indicating how many test cases follow, then an integer `n` indicating the number of integers in the list, and finally a list of `n` integers. The function does not return a single value but processes and returns information for each test case based on the given inputs.
