Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in the list `a`.

This final output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop. The values of `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 4


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is increased by `x // 4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is increased by the previous value of `x` // 4, and `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()` and ans is now ans plus x divided by 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `ans` plus the next value of `x // 4`, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()` and `ans` is updated by adding the next value of `x // 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
