Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n` (where `n` is derived from `x`).

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - `output1` is a list containing 1 and 3
   - `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2` and the integer value of `x / 3`

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, we need to check if `3 < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - If `3 < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is true, then `i` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `n` remains the same since it is derived from `x` and does not change within the loop.
   - The lists `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on these lists within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1 and 3, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2` and the integer value of `x / 3`**.
