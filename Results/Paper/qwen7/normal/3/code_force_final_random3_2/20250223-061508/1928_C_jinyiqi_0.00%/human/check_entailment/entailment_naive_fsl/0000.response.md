Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for a given `n` and `x`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but the logic to filter out valid `k` values is flawed.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`.

According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions. We need to find how many `k` values satisfy the conditions.

- For `k = 2`: The sequence is `1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2`. Position 2 has value 2, which matches.
- For `k = 3`: The sequence is `1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2`. Position 2 has value 2, which matches.
- For `k = 5`: The sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2`. Position 2 has value 2, which matches.
- For `k = 6`: The sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`. Position 2 has value 2, which matches.

So, the correct answer should be 4.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid `k` values. It checks the divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` and filters them based on certain conditions, but it does not correctly account for the repeating pattern and the constraints of `k > 1`.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic and fails to provide the correct answer for this and potentially other cases.
