Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1 and 3, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2` and the integer value of `x / 3`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `x / i` (which is `x / 3`) to the list `output2`. Since `i` is 3, `output2` now contains both the original value (which was the integer value of `x / 2`) and the new value (which is the integer value of `x / 3`). The other variables remain unchanged.
