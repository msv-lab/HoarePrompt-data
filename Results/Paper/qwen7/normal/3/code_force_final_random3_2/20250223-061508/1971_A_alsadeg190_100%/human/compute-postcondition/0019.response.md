Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and after executing the if-else block, if `x` is less than `y`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`; otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and `y` as well.**
