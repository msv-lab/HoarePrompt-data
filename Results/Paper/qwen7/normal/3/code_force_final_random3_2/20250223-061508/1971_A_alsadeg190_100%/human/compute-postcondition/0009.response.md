Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the condition also remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `x`, `x` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `x` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and if `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the condition also remains unchanged.**
