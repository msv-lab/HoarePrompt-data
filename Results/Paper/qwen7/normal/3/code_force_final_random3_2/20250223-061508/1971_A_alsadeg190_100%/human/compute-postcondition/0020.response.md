Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(x)` and `x` is an input integer greater than 0), `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and after executing the if-else block 99 times, if `x` is less than `y` in any iteration, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged; otherwise, they also remain unchanged.

This means that regardless of the values of `x` and `y` entered in each iteration, their final values will be the same as the last values assigned to them within the loop. Since the loop does not modify `x` and `y` unless `x` is less than `y`, and it continues to read new inputs in each iteration, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the result of the last input provided.
