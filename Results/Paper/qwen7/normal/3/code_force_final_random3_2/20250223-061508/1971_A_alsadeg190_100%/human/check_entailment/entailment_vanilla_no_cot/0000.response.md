Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program reads `x` at the beginning but then uses `x` and `y` within the loop without updating them. This means that the same value of `x` is used for all test cases, which is incorrect.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum and maximum as required.
