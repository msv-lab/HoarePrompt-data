Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs `x` times and `x` can be any positive integer up to 100 based on the initial state), `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and after executing the if-else block 99 times, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers provided as input, with the condition that either `x` is less than `y` or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains within its initial bounds, and `i` reaches its maximum possible value given the constraints of the problem.
