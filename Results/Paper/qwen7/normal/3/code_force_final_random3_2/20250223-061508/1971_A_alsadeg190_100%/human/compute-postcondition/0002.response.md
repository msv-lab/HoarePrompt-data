Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 0 is preserved.
