Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if x < y:
        print(x, y)
    else:
        print(y, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and if `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the condition also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and the condition `x` is less than `y` or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and after executing the if-else block, if `x` is less than `y`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`; otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and `y` as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
