Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes an integer t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each t, two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9. Based on these inputs, the function returns either an error message indicating t is out of range or specific values derived from x and y depending on the conditions provided.**
