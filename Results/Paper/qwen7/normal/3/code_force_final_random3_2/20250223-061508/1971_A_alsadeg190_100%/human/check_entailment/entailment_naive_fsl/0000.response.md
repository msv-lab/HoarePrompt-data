Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases in a loop, which is incorrect. Instead, it should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then process each test case individually. Here is an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
2
5 3
7 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3 5
2 7
```

Actual Output:
```
3 5
5 3
```

The program does not correctly handle the second test case because it uses the value of `x` from the first test case for the second test case, leading to incorrect results.
