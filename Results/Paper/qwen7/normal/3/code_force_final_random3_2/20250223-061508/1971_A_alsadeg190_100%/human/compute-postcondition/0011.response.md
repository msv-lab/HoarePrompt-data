Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and the condition `x` is less than `y` or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` remains unchanged.**

This means that `t` and `i` retain their initial values, `x` and `y` are updated to the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and the condition regarding `x` and `y` remains as it was before the code execution.
