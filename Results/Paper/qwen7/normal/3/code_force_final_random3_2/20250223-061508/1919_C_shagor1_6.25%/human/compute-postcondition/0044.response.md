Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `x` is the minimum value in the list `inp`, `y` is the second smallest value in the list `inp`, `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`, `inp` is the same list as before.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, and `inp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
