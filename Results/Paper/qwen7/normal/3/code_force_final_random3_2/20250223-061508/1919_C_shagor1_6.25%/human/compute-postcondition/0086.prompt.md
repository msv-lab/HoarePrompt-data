Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `n` is a new input integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `inp` is updated with new integer values from input.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `a` (which is equal to `x`) is less than or equal to any element in `inp`, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` is equal to the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `x`, and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `y` is greater than or equal to all elements in `inp`, and `x` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `a` is the next element in `inp`. If `a <= x`, then `x` remains unchanged, and `ans` is equal to its previous value. Otherwise, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is equal to its previous value plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` remains the same or increases by 1, `y` is either equal to `a` or the next element in `inp`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a` is greater than `y`, otherwise `ans` remains the same or increases by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
