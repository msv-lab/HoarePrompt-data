Output State: **`ans` is the count of unique minimum elements encountered in `inp`, `x` is the overall minimum element in `inp`, `y` is the last unique minimum element encountered in `inp` if there are multiple minimum elements, otherwise `y` is the same as `x` if there is only one minimum element; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `x`, and `y`. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user.
