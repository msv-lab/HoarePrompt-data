Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is equal to either `a` or the next element in `inp` (let's call it `a_new`), `y` is either `n + 1` or `a` depending on whether `a <= x` or `a > x`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a <= y` or `a_new <= y` holds true, and `y` is now equal to `a` if `a <= y` or `a_new` if `a > y`.
