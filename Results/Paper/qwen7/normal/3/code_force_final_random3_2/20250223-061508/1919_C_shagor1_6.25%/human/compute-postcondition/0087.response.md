Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the count of unique minimum elements encountered in `inp`.
- `x` is the overall minimum element in `inp`.
- `y` is the last unique minimum element encountered in `inp` if there are multiple minimum elements; otherwise, it is the same as `x` if there is only one minimum element.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the count of unique minimum elements found in the list `inp`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of unique minimum elements encountered in inp)**
