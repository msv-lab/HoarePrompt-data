Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n + 1` to both `x` and `y`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the tuple `inp` is also not affected by this code snippet.
