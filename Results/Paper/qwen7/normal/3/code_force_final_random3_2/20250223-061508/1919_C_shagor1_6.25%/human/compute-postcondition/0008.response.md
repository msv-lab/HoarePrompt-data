Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `inp` must have at least one element, and the value of `a` is less than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` assigns the value of `a` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
