Postcondition: `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `a` (which is equal to `x`) is less than or equal to any element in `inp`, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` is equal to the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `x`, and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `y` is greater than or equal to every element in `inp`, and `x` remains unchanged.
