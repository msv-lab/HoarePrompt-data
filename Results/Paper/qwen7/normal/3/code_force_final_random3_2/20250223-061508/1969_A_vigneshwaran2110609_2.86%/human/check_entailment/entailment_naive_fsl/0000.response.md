Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
2
2 1
```

In this case, there are only two friends, and each is the best friend of the other. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends so that at least two friends come to the party. However, the program prints `2` in this case, which is incorrect because sending invitations to only one friend would suffice (since both friends will come if either receives an invitation).

The program should check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and handle the case where no such pair exists separately.
