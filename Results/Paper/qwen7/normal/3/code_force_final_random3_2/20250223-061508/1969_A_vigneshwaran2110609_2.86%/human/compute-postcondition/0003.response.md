Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by taking a single line of input, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, splitting the input into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new list `l` contains the integers from the input.
