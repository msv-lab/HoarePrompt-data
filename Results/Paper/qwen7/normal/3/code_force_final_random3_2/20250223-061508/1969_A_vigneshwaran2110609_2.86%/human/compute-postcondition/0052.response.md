Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 50.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` must be greater than 50 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head but ensures the loop can potentially run).
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers (not directly relevant to the loop head).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 0. However, since `x` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `x` is a non-negative integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is already set to 50, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `x` is a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must be a non-negative integer.

**State:**
**`i` is 50, `x` must be a non-negative integer**
