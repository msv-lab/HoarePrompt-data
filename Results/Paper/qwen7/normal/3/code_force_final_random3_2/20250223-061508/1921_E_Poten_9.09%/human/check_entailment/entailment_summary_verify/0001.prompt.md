You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or neither can win based on specific conditions related to these integers. The function appends the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to a list for each test case and prints the results in the order they were processed. The final output is a list of outcomes for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly initializes the test cases and splits the input into individual variables for each test case.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's position (`x_a`) is greater than Bob's position (`x_b`) or if Alice is already in the last row (`x_a == h`).
   - If either condition is true, it directly appends "Draw" to the answers list. This part is correct because if Alice is in the last row, she cannot move further down, and if Alice's position is greater than Bob's, Bob cannot catch Alice.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd) of Alice's and Bob's positions.
   - If both positions have the same parity, it further checks the relative positions of Alice and Bob.
   - If Alice is to the left of Bob, it checks the distance between them and whether Alice can move to Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice.
   - If Alice is to the right of Bob, similar checks are performed.
   - If Alice and Bob have different parities, it directly assigns "Alice" as the winner. This is correct because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally when the parities differ.

4. **Detailed Checks for Specific Cases:**
   - The program handles specific cases where Alice and Bob are close to each other and checks if Alice can force a win or if the game results in a draw.
   - These checks involve comparing distances and ensuring that Alice can always move to Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice, considering the constraints of the board.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the outcomes are determined accurately based on the given rules. The program does not contain any logical errors or omissions that would lead to incorrect results.
