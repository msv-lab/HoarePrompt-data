Output State: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing all of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' generated during the loop's execution, `j` is the last element of the `answers` list.

In this final state, the loop has executed for all `test_cases`, appending either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' to the `answers` list based on the conditions inside the loop. After all iterations, `answers` will contain a list of all the outcomes for each test case, and `j` will hold the last outcome appended to the list, which is the last element of the `answers` list.
