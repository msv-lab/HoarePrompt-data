Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing one more element 'Alice' than before, `i` is `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. This increases the length of the `answers` list by one, making it contain one more element `'Alice'` than it did before. The `clues` list and the variable `i` (which is equal to `test_cases`) remain unchanged.
