Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing 'Draw'**.

The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Since `clues` was initially a list of integers entered by the user, its state remains unchanged. The new state includes that `answers` now contains the string `'Draw'`.
