Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, the third element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and either (clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)) holds true.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The value of `test_cases`, `i`, and the list `clues` remain unchanged. The conditions involving `clues` also remain valid as no changes were made to these elements.
