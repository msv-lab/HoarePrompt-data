Postcondition: `test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `i` is 0 or 1, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is either equal to or less than the fifth element of `clues`. If the third element is equal to the fifth element, the fourth element is not equal to the fifth element, and the decision to append 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' to `answers` is based on the parity of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` as well as the comparison between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`. If the third element is less than the fifth element, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`; if the third element is greater than the fifth element, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`; if the third element is equal to the fifth element, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
