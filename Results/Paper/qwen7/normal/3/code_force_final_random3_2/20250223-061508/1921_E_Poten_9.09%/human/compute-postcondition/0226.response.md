Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and `i` is `test_cases`. If `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` has an additional 'Draw' appended. Otherwise, `answers` has an additional 'Alice' appended.
