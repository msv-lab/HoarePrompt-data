Postcondition: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and `i` is `test_cases`. Depending on the condition `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0`:
- If the condition is true and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is true and `clues[3] == clues[5]` is false, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` and the following conditions are met: 
  - `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
- If the condition is true and `clues[3] == clues[5]` is false, 'Bob' is appended to `answers` if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` and the above conditions are not met.
- If the condition is true and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the following conditions are met: 
  - `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
- If the condition is true and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1` and the above conditions are not met, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is false and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is false and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is false and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the following conditions are met: 
  - `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.
- If the condition is false and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1` and the above conditions are not met, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.**
