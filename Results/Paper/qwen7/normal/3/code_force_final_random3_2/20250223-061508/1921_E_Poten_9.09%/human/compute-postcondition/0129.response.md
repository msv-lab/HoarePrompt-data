Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `clues`. Since the exact values are not provided, the state of `clues` is described as a list of integers entered by the user.
