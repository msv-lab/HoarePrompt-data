Postcondition: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and `i` is `test_cases`. Depending on the condition `clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1`:
- If the condition is true and `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] == clues[5]` is true, or 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] == clues[5]` is false and the specified conditions are met.
- If the condition is true and `clues[3] == clues[5]` is false and the specified conditions are not met, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is true and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the specified conditions are met, or 'Bob' is appended to `answers` if the specified conditions are not met.
- If the condition is false and `clues[3] == clues[5]` is true, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is false and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
- If the condition is false and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the specified conditions are met, or 'Alice' is appended to `answers` if the specified conditions are not met.**
