Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the following conditions: if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, or if `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2] - clues[4]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
