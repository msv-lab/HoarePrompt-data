Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings using space as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns these integers to the list `clues`. The `answers` list and the variable `i` (which is equal to `test_cases`) are not affected by this operation.
