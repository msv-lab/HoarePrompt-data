Output State: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing all of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' generated during the loop's execution, `j` is the last element of the `answers` list.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `answers` will contain every single outcome ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') generated for each test case, and `j` will be set to the last string added to the `answers` list, which is the result of the last test case processed.
