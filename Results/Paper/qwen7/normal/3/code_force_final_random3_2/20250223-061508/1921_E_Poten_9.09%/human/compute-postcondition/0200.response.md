Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Bob' appended, `i` is `test_cases`**.

The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The lists `clues` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
