Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing 'Alice'**.

The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Since `clues` was initially a list of integers, its state remains unchanged. The new state includes that `answers` now contains the element `'Alice'`.
