Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing the element 'Bob' appended to the original list, `i` is `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Bob')` appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`clues` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
