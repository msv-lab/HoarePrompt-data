Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing 'Bob'**.

The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Since `clues` was the only list mentioned in the initial state and no changes were made to it, its state remains unchanged. The new state includes the updated `answers` list which now contains the string `'Bob'`.
