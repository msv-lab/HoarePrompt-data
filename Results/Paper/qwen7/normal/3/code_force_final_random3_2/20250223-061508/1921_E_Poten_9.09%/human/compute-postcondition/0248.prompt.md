You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and (x_a, y_a) ≠ (x_b, y_b).

    #State: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each iteration of the loop, and `i` is equal to `test_cases` - 1. The value of `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces for each iteration. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' is appended to `answers` for each test case.
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing all of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' generated during the loop's execution, `j` is the last element of the `answers` list.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has executed for all `test_cases`, appending either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' to the `answers` list based on the conditions inside the loop. After all iterations, `answers` will contain a list of all the outcomes for each test case, and `j` will hold the last outcome appended to the list, which is the last element of the `answers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and (x_a, y_a) ≠ (x_b, y_b). It also ensures that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function returns a value based on the given conditions.
