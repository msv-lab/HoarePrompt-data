Postcondition: `test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than or equal to the current value of `clues[5]`, and the following inequality holds: \((clues[5] - 1 - 1) \leq abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)\) and \((clues[3] - clues[5] - 1) \leq abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)\).
