Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, then `answers` remains as ['Draw']. Otherwise, `answers` is updated to contain either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on additional unspecified conditions.
