Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` now contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents.
- `n` is the next value from `qs`.
- `qs` must still have at least one value remaining.

The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement will join the elements of `res` into a single string with spaces between them and then print it.

Since `res` includes the result of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents, the exact values in `res` depend on the initial contents and the result of `func_1`.

Output: **the elements of res separated by spaces (where res includes the previous contents plus the result of func_1(res[0], p))**
