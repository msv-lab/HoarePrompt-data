Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` contains the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `func_1(n, p)` has been called.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values in `qs` for `n` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `n` from `qs`, the variable `n` will change in each iteration.
   - The variable `qs` itself does not change within the loop; it is the source of the values for `n`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `res` will contain the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the current value of `n`.
   - `n` will be the next value from `qs`.
   - `qs` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified outside the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `n` and the unchanged `qs` and `res`.

**State: **`res` contains the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` must still have at least one value remaining**.
