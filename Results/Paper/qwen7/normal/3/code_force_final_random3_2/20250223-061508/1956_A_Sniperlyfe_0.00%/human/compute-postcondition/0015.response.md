Output State: **`res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is an empty list (after all elements have been processed), `n` does not exist as it has been iterated through all elements in `qs`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to every element `n` in the list `qs`. The variable `t` remains greater than 0, `k` and `q` remain as they were initially input by the user, `p` remains as a list of integers split from a string, and `qs` becomes an empty list since all its elements have been processed. The variable `n` no longer exists because the loop has completed all its iterations over `qs`.
