Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs:`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is an integer input from the user
   - `q` is an integer input from the user
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `n` is an element of `qs`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be the next element in the list `qs`. Since `n` was an element of `qs` in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `n` should be set to the next element in `qs`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `res` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop
- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop
- `k` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop
- `q` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop
- `p` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop
- `qs` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop
- `n` is now the next element in `qs`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the next element of `qs`**
