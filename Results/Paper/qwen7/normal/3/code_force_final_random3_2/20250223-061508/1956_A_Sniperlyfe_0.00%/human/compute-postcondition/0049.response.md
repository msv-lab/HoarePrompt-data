Output State: `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, for all iterations of the loop. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer input from the user. After all iterations, `res` will contain `t * len(qs)` elements, with each element being the result of applying `func_1` to each integer in `qs` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, and `t` is reduced to 0 after all iterations have completed.
