Output State: **`k` is the first integer input from the user, `q` is the second integer input from the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `k` and `q` are integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is now a list of integers obtained from the map function, `n` does not exist as it has been iterated through all elements in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. This list is assigned to `qs`. The values of `k`, `q`, `t`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
