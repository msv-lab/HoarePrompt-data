Output State: **`res` now contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents, `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` has one less value remaining; `res` is updated by appending the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to itself.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Here, `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` must have at least one value remaining (one less than before). The initial state of `res` contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents, and `n` is the next value from `qs`. After executing the code, `res` is updated by appending the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to itself, and `qs` has one less value remaining.
