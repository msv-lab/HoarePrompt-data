Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user.
   - `q` is an integer input from the user.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is an empty list (after all elements have been processed).
   - `n` does not exist as it has been iterated through all elements in `qs`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - Therefore, `t` should be decremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is an empty list (after all elements have been processed), `n` does not exist as it has been iterated through all elements in `qs`.**
