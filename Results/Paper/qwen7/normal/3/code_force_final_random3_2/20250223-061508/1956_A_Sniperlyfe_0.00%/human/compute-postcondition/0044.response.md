Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` has two elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)`. After appending, `res` now has three elements, with the third element being the same as the second element, both being the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The values of `qs` and `n` remain unchanged.
