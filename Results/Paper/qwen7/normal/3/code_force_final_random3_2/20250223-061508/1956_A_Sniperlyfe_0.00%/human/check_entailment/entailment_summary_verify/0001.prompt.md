You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases (controlled by `t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `k` and `q`, followed by a list `p` of `k` distinct positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then applies another function `func_1` to each element in `qs` using the corresponding `p`, storing the results in a list `res`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` after processing all elements in `qs` for all test cases. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list of results based on the input lists `p` and `qs`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the game process.
   - It takes two parameters: `n`, the number of players, and `p`, which is the sequence of positions to kick out players.
   - The function iteratively reduces the number of players `n` by the number of players that need to be kicked out in each round.
   - The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out in a round.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2()` is the main function that processes the input and outputs the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the sequence `k` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to get the number of winners and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` as specified.
   - This matches the problem description.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function `func_1` simulates the game process correctly.
   - It iteratively reduces the number of players by the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - It stops when no more players can be kicked out in a round, which is the correct stopping condition.
   - The logic inside the loop is correct for the game simulation.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input, simulates the game process accurately, and produces the correct output.
