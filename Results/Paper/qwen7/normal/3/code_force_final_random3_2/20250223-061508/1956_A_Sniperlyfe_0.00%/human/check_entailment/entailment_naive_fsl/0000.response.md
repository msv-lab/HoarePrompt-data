Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. 

Let's analyze the issue with `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Kicking Out Players**: The function `func_1` subtracts the sum of players to be kicked out from `n` without properly accounting for the sequence `p`. It simply iterates over `p` and subtracts 1 for each element less than or equal to `n`, which does not reflect the actual game rules.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   2 1
   3 5
   5
   ```
   According to the problem statement, the sequence of events should be:
   - Round 1: Kick out the 3rd and 5th players (C and E). Remaining players: ABD.
   - Round 2: Kick out the 3rd player (D). Remaining players: AB.
   - No more players to kick out in the next round, so A and B are declared as winners.

   However, the function `func_1` will incorrectly handle this:
   - For `n = 5`, it will subtract 2 (for the 3rd and 5th positions) and then 1 (for the 3rd position again), resulting in `n = 2`. This is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the game rules.

Therefore, since the function does not correctly implement the game logic, the program is incorrect.
