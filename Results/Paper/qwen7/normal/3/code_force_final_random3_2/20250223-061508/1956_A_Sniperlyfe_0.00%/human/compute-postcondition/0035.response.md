Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `res`. None of the other variables (`qs`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
