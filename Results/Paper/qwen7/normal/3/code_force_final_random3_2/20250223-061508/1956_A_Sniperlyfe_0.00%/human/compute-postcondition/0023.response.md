To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` contains the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `func_1(n, p)` has been called, but the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

Given this information, we need to understand what `res` might contain after `func_1(n, p)` is called. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `res`. However, we know that `res` is expected to be a list or an iterable of elements, and the `map` function will apply the `str` function to each element in `res`.

The `join` method then concatenates these string representations with spaces in between.

Since we do not have the exact values or types of elements in `res`, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **a space-separated string of the string representations of the elements in `res`**
