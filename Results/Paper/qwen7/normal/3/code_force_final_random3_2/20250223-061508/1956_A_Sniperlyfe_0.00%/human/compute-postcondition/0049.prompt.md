Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 <= `p[0]` < `p[1]` < ... < `p[k-1]` <= 100, `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 <= `qs[i]` <= 100 for all 0 <= `i` < `q`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is an empty list (after all elements have been processed), `n` does not exist as it has been iterated through all elements in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` iterates through every element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will be a list where each element corresponds to the result of applying `func_1` to each integer in `qs`, in the order they appear in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
