Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists k and q, where k and q are positive integers within the range of 1 to 100, and p is a list of k positive integers in ascending order within the range of 1 to 100, and qs is a list of q positive integers within the range of 1 to 100. The function returns a result based on the relationship between the elements of p and qs.**

This means the function processes two lists, p and qs, which are predefined within the function, and checks each element of qs against the elements in p to determine the output.
