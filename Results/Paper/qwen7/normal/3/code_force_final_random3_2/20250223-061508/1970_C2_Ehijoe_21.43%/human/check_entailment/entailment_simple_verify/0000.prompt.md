You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function is designed to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it does not account for the game's rules and the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on optimal play. The current implementation does not handle the game rounds or the alternating moves between players. Instead, it calculates distances, which is not relevant to determining the winner of the game.

For example, consider a tree with 5 nodes and one round, where the starting node is 1:

- Tree structure: 
  ```
  1
 / \
2   3
|   |
4   5
  ```

- Starting node: 1

In this case, Ron would start by moving the stone to either node 2 or node 3. Hermione would then move the stone to the other child of the chosen node, and so on. The program should simulate these moves and determine the winner based on the optimal strategy, but it currently does not do so.
