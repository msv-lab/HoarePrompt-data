Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 4, `nodes[u]` is a list containing `v`, and `nodes[v].append(u)` is executed.**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contains `v`. After executing `nodes[v].append(u)`, the list `nodes[v]` now contains both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
