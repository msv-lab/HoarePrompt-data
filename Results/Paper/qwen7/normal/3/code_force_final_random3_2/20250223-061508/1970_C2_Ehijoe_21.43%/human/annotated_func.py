#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary where each key represents a node (an integer between 1 and n), and the corresponding value is a list of integers representing its neighbors (excluding the parent node if provided). start is an integer representing the starting node (a value between 1 and n), and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node of the current node (default is None).

    return distances
    #The program returns the list `distances` which contains all possible path lengths from the starting node (`start`) to every other node in the `nodes` graph, incremented by 1 for each step taken away from the starting node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `nodes`, an integer `start`, and an optional integer `parent`. The dictionary `nodes` represents a graph where keys are nodes and values are lists of neighbors. The function returns either a list containing a single element 0 if the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent, or a list of all possible path lengths from the starting node to every other node in the graph, incremented by 1 for each step taken away from the starting node.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and moves is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made during the game.
def func_2():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []

    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing tuples representing all the edges entered during the loop, `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it, `i` is \(n-1\), and both `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` contain each other for every edge \((u, v)\) added to the graph.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `nodes` defaultdict will represent the entire graph with each node pointing to all nodes it is connected to via the edges provided by the user inputs. The variable `i` will be set to \(n-1\) since the loop runs \(n-1\) times, and `edges` will contain all the edges as tuples.
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: All keys in the `nodes` defaultdict that have a list of length 1 are appended to the `leaves` deque.
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: All keys in the `nodes` defaultdict that have a list of length 1 are appended to the `leaves` deque, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If at least one move in `moves` is an odd number, the condition is met. Otherwise, all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure defined by its nodes and edges. It starts by reading the number of nodes (n), the number of edges (t), the edges themselves, and the starting node (start). It then identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection) and stores them. After obtaining a sequence of moves from another function (func_1), it checks if any move in the sequence is odd. If at least one move is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function ultimately determines and outputs either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the parity of the moves in the sequence.
