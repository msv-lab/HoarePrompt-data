Postcondition: `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key, and `leaves` has the key appended to it if the length of `nodes[key]` is 1. If the length of `nodes[key]` is not 1, `nodes` and `leaves` remain unchanged.
