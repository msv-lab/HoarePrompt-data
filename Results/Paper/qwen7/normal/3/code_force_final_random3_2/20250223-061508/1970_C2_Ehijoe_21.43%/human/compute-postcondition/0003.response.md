Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` where all values are lists. This does not change the values of the existing variables (`empty`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `nodes` is created with the specified default behavior.
