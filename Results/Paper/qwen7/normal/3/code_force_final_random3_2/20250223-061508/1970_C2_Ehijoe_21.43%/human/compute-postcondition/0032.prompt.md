Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing tuples representing all the edges entered during the loop, `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it, `i` is \(n-1\), and `leaves` is a deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key. If the length of the list corresponding to the key is exactly 1, `leaves` is a list containing the key. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key, and `leaves` has the key appended to it if the length of `nodes[key]` is 1. If the length of `nodes[key]` is not 1, `nodes` and `leaves` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key, and `leaves` now has the key appended to it if the length of `nodes[key]` is 1. If the length of `nodes[key]` is not 1, `leaves` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
