Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing tuples representing all the edges entered during the loop, `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it, `i` is \(n-1\), and `leaves` is a deque.**

Explanation: The line `leaves = deque()` creates a new empty deque named `leaves`. This deque is initialized to be empty, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, all other variables retain their previous states.
