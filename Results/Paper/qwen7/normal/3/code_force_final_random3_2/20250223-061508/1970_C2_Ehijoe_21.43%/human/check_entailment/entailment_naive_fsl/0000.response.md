Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function is designed to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it does not account for the game's rules and the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on optimal play. The current implementation does not handle the game rounds or the alternating moves between players. Instead, it calculates distances, which is not relevant to determining the winner of the game.

For example, consider a tree with 5 nodes and one round, where the starting node is 1:

- Tree structure: 
  ```
  1
 / \
2   3
|   |
4   5
  ```

- Starting node: 1

In this case, Ron would start by moving the stone to either node 2 or node 3. Hermione would then move the stone to the other child of the chosen node, and so on. The program should simulate these moves and determine the winner based on the optimal strategy, but it currently does not do so.
