Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v), `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` contains the value `v`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. All other variables remain unchanged.
