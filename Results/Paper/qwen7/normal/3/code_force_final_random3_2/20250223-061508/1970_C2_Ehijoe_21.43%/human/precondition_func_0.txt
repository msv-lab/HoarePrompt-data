nodes is a dictionary where each key represents a node (an integer between 1 and n), and the corresponding value is a list of integers representing its neighbors (excluding the parent node if provided). start is an integer representing the starting node (a value between 1 and n), and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node of the current node (default is None).
