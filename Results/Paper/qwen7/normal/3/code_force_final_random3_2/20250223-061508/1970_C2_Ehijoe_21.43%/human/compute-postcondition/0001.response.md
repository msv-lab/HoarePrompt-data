Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made during the game.**

The code initializes the variable `edges` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `start`, or `moves`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
