Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Min`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Min), k - Min)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / (k - Min)), k - Min)`, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)`**, and `n - Min * Max` must be greater than or equal to `k - Min` and `k - Min` must be greater than 0.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `k`. The conditions for `n`, `Min`, `Max`, and `k` remain valid post-execution.
