Output: **NO**

Explanation: The print statement `print('NO')` directly outputs the string 'NO'. According to the initial state, none of the variables `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, `tab`, and `t` are relevant to the print statement. The only string being printed is the literal string 'NO'.
