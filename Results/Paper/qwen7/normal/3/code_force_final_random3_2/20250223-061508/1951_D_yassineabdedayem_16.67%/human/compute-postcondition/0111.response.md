Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tab`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the second element of `tab`.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `Min` is 0.
   - `Max` is 0.
   - `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `tab` for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently the second element of `tab`, the next value of `i` will be the third element of `tab`.
   - The list `tab` will now have one fewer element because the loop will move to the next element.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be the third element of `tab`.
- `tab` will have at least 59 elements (since it had at least 60 elements before and one element was processed).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is the third element of `tab`, `tab` is a list containing at least 59 elements, `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration**
