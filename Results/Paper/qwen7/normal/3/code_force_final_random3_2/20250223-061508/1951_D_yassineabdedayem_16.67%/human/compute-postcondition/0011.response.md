Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is equal to `Min`, `k` is `k - Max`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. `Min` and `Max` are defined based on the initial values of `n` and `k`, and `number` is set to `Min`. After executing the code, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, while `t`, `n`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` retain their initial definitions relative to the initial values of `n` and `k`.
