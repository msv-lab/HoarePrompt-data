Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `n // k`, `Max` is `int(n / k)`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `int(n / k)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `n // k`, `number` now holds the same value as `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged.
