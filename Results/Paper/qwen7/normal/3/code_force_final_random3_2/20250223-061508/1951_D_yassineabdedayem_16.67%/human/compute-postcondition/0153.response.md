Output State: **`n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` (which is `max(int(n / k), k)`) to the variable `number`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
