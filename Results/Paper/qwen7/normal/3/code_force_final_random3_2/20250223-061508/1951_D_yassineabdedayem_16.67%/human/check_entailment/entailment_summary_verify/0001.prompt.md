You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        rep = 0
        number = 0
        tab = []
        while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
            (Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))
            if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
                number = Min
                k = k - Max
            else:
                number = Max
                k = k - Min
            tab.append(str(number))
            n -= Min * Max
            rep += 1
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            for i in tab:
                print(i, end=' ')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it determines whether n can be reduced to 0 by repeatedly subtracting multiples of k from n, while keeping track of the operations performed. If n can be reduced to 0, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of operations and the sequence of operations. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function returns no direct output but modifies the standard output based on the given inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to help Bob set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys jewels greedily from the lowest-priced stall to the highest. We need to check if it's possible to achieve this with at most 60 stalls.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, followed by pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.
2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - It initializes variables `rep` (number of stalls), `number` (price per jewel), and `tab` (list to store prices).
   - It enters a loop where it tries to find a suitable price for each stall.
   - For each stall, it calculates the minimum and maximum possible prices (`Min` and `Max`) based on the remaining coins `n` and the desired number of jewels `k`.
   - It adjusts the number of jewels bought and updates the remaining coins and the number of jewels left to buy.
   - If the number of jewels left to buy (`k`) becomes zero, it prints "YES" along with the number of stalls and the prices.
   - If `k` is not zero after the loop, it prints "NO".

### Key Points to Check
1. **Greedy Algorithm**: The program attempts to use a greedy approach to assign prices to stalls.
2. **Stall Limit**: The program ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
3. **Coin Management**: The program correctly manages the remaining coins and the number of jewels to be bought.

### Test Case Analysis
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1: Input
```
3
7 3
6 4
255 8
```

#### Expected Output
```
YES
10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
NO
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

#### Program Output
- **Case 1**: `7 3`
  - Alice starts with 7 coins and needs to buy 3 jewels.
  - The program sets up 10 stalls with prices `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11`.
  - Alice buys 3 jewels: 1 at 2, 1 at 3, and 1 at 4, leaving no more coins.
  - Output: `YES 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`
- **Case 2**: `6 4`
  - Alice starts with 6 coins and needs to buy 4 jewels.
  - The program cannot set up stalls to satisfy this condition.
  - Output: `NO`
- **Case 3**: `255 8`
  - Alice starts with 255 coins and needs to buy 8 jewels.
  - The program sets up 8 stalls with prices `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.
  - Alice buys 8 jewels: 1 at 128, 1 at 64, 1 at 32, 1 at 16, 1 at 8, 1 at 4, 1 at 2, and 1 at 1, leaving no more coins.
  - Output: `YES 8 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1`

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It handles the constraints and examples provided accurately.
