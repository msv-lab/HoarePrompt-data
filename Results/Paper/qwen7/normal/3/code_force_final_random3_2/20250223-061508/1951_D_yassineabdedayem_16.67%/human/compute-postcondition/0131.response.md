Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, and `t` is 61.**

Explanation: The code `number = Max` assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, the variable `number` now holds the value of `max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
