Output State: `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from the loop iterations, and `t` is 61.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 60 iterations (since `rep` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches 60), the conditions `n != 0` and `k > 0` will no longer be met, causing the loop to terminate. By the end of the loop, both `n` and `k` will be 0 because they are continuously decremented within the loop. The variable `Min` and `Max` will also be 0 as they are reassigned based on the remaining values of `n` and `k`, which become 0. The variable `number` will be 0 as well since `n` becomes 0. The list `tab` will contain the string representations of the `number` values determined in each iteration of the loop.
