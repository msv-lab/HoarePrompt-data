Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is decreased by `Min`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The line `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial states.
