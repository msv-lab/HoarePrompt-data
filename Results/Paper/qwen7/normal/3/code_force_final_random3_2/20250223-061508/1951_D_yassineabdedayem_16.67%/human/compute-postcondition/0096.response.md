Postcondition: `rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `Min` and `Max`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is updated to `Max - Min`, and `tab` includes the string representation of `Max - Min`.
