Output State: **t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), rep is 60, n is 0, k is 0, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, tab is a list containing the string representations of number with 60 elements.**

**Explanation:**
Given the provided information, we can infer that the loop is iterating over the `tab` list, which contains 60 elements. The loop does not modify any of the variables `t`, `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, or `number`. Instead, it simply prints each element of the `tab` list using the `print(i, end=' ')` statement. Since the loop iterates exactly 60 times (once for each element in `tab`), after all iterations, the `tab` list remains unchanged, still containing the string representations of `number` from each iteration. All other variables (`t`, `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain at their initial values because they are not being modified within the loop.
