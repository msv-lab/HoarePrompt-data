Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // (k - min(n // k, k)), k - min(n // k, k))`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`, `number` is `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The variable `rep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet.
