Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The new variables `Min` and `Max` are defined based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` takes the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` takes the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
