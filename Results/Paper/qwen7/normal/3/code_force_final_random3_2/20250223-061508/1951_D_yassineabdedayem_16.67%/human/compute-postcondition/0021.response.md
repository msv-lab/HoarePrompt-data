Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Since `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, these conditions remain valid. The values of `Min` and `Max` are calculated as follows:
- `Min` is the minimum between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is the maximum between `int(n / k)` and `k`.

These new values replace the original values of `Min` and `Max`, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `rep`) retain their original constraints.
