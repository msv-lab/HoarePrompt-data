Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. The current value of `Max` is `k` and the current value of `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.
