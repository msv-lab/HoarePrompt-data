Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated based on the condition (`k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k - min(n // k, k)`), `Min` is updated accordingly (`min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `min(n // k, k)`), `Max` is updated accordingly (`k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `max(int(n / k), k)`), `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the condition, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)`, and `t` is 61.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. The values of `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, `tab`, and `t` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly updated elsewhere in the code, which is not the case here. Therefore, their states are carried forward from the initial state.
