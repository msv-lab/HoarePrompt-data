Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, `k` is `k - Min`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from its current value. The other variables (`n`, `rep`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
