Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in the input; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `tab`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `number` remain unchanged from their initial states.
