Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in tab:`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element of `tab`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the second element of `tab`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` should now be the second element of `tab`.
   - Other variables (`tab`, `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is the second element of `tab`, `tab` is a list containing at least 60 elements, `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration**.
