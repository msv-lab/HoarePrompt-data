Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is `rep + 60`, `n` is `n - 60 * (Min * Max)`, `k` is `k - 60 * Min` or `k - 60 * Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` after 60 iterations, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` after 60 iterations, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` after 60 iterations, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed up to its maximum allowed iterations (60). The variables `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` reflect their values after 60 iterations of the loop, while `tab` accumulates the string representations of `number` for each iteration.
