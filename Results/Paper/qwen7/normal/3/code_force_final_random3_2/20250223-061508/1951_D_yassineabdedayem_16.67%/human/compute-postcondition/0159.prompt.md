Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is a non-positive integer, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, and `t` is 61.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated based on the condition (`k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k - min(n // k, k)`), `Min` is updated accordingly (`min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `min(n // k, k)`), `Max` is updated accordingly (`k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `max(int(n / k), k)`), `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the condition, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)`, and `t` is 61.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rep` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `min(n // (k - Min), k - Min)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int((n - Min * Max) / (k - Max)), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k - Min)), k - Min)`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)` appended, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rep` is increased by 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is decreased by `Min`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
