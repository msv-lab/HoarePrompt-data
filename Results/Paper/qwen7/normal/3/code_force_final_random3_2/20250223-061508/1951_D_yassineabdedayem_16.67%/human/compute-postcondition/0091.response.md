Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the if condition, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max`, and now includes the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `Min` and `Max`. `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables (`rep`, `n`, `number`, and `tab`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
