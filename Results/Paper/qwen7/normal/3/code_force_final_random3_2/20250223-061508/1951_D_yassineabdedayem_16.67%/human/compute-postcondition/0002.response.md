Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in the input.**

The code reads two integers from the standard input using `stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. These strings are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second integer is assigned to `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
