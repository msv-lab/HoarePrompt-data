Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\), `rep` is 60, `n` is an integer read from the standard input, `k` is either 0 or greater than 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the standard input using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
