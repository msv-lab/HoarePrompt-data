Output State: `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `Min` and `Max` repeated 60 times.

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`. Given the conditions, the loop will run exactly 60 times because `rep` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches 60.
- After 60 iterations, `n` will be reduced to 0 because `n -= Min * Max` and `Min * Max` is always a positive value as long as `n` and `k` are positive.
- `k` will also be reduced to 0 because it decreases by `Min` or `Max` in each iteration, and eventually, it will reach 0 after sufficient iterations.
- `Min` and `Max` are recalculated in each iteration but since `n` and `k` are eventually reduced to 0, their values will be 0.
- `number` will be assigned `Max` in the last iteration, which is `max(int(n / k), k)`, but since `n` and `k` are 0, `Max` will be 0.
- `tab` will contain the string representations of `Min` and `Max` repeated 60 times, as `number` is appended to `tab` in each iteration.
