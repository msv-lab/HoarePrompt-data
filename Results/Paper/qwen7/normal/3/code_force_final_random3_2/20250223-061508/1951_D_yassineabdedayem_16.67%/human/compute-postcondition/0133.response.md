Postcondition: `rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is set to `k - Max`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, `Max` is updated to `k - Max`, `number` is set to `Min`, and `k` is adjusted such that `Max` is `k - Max`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k - min(n // k, k)`, `Min` remains as `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` remains as `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is set to `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `k` is adjusted accordingly. `number` and `tab` remain as empty lists, and `t` remains 61.
