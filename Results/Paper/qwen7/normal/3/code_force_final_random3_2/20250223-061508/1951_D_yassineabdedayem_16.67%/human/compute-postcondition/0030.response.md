Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `number` is `min(n // k, k) - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

The code `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes `rep` being increased by 1, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
