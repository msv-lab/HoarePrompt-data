Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer and `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` and convert it to an integer.

Let's break down the expression:

1. `2 * b` multiplies `b` by 2.
2. `- n` subtracts `n` from the result of `2 * b`.
3. `+ 1` adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
4. `* n` multiplies the result by `n`.
5. `// 2` performs integer division by 2.

Given that `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, let's denote the actual values of `a` and `b` as follows:
- Let `a = some_integer_a`
- Let `b = some_integer_b` where `some_integer_b > some_integer_a` and `some_integer_b - some_integer_a >= n`

For simplicity, let's assume specific values for `a`, `b`, and `n` that satisfy the conditions. For example, let `a = 5`, `b = 10`, and `n = 5`.

Substituting these values into the expression:

1. `2 * b = 2 * 10 = 20`
2. `20 - n = 20 - 5 = 15`
3. `15 + 1 = 16`
4. `16 * n = 16 * 5 = 80`
5. `80 // 2 = 40`

Thus, the expression evaluates to `40`.

Output: **40**
