Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The print statement is `print(n * a)`. Here, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input. Therefore, the print statement will multiply these two integers and print the result.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer from the input and a is the second integer from the input)**
