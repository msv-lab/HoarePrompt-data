Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The expression to be evaluated is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `2 * b` multiplies the value of `b` by 2.
2. `- n` subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous step.
3. `+ 1` adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
4. `* n` multiplies the result by `n`.
5. `// 2` performs integer division by 2.

Given that `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, the exact values of `n` and `b` will determine the final result. Since the values of `a` and `t` are not used in the expression, they do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will be the integer result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2**
