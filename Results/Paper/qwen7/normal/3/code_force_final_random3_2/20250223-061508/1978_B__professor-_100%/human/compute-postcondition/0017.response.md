Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is updated to the first input integer.
- `a` is updated to the second input integer.
- `b` is updated to the third input integer.

When the print statement `print(n * a)` is executed, it will print the product of the updated `n` and `a`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n * a (where n is the first input integer and a is the second input integer)**
