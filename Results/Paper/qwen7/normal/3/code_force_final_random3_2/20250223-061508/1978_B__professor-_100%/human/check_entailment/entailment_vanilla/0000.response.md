Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program prints `n * a`. This means all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. This suggests selling all buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`. This suggests selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`.

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - When `b <= a`, the maximum profit is indeed `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - When `b - a >= n`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the modified prices. The sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1` is given by the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence: 
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left(2b - (n - 1)\right) = \frac{n}{2} (2b - n + 1)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}
     \]
   - When `b - a < n`, the optimal strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price. The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     S_k = \frac{k}{2} \left(2b - (k - 1)\right) = \frac{k}{2} (2b - k + 1)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     S_k = \frac{(2b - k + 1) \cdot k}{2}
     \]
     The total profit is then:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{(2b - k + 1) \cdot k}{2} + a \cdot (n - k)
     \]
     To maximize this, we need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the expression. However, the provided formula directly gives the maximum profit without explicitly finding `k`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the conditions given. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
