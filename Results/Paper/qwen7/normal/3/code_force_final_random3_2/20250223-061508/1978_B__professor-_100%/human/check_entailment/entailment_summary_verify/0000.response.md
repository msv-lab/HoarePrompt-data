### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
- Bob has \( n \) buns.
- The usual price of a bun is \( a \) coins.
- Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)).
- The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price of \( b - i + 1 \) coins each.
- The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.
- The goal is to maximize the profit.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes \( t \) test cases.
- Each test case consists of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
- It calculates and prints the result based on the given conditions.
- After processing all test cases, the variable \( t \) is set to 0, indicating completion.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - If \( b \le a \), all buns should be sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The profit is \( n \times a \).
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - If \( b - a \ge n \), the optimal choice is to sell all \( n \) buns at the modified price.
   - The sum of the modified prices is the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) with a common difference of -1.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) terms of this sequence is \( \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1) \).
   - This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - Here, we need to find the optimal \( k \) such that the profit is maximized.
   - The profit is given by \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) / 2 + a \times (n - k) \).
   - The optimal \( k \) is \( \min(b, n) \).
   - The program correctly uses this formula when \( b - a < n \).

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the program logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and handles all potential cases as required by the problem description.
