Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is then updated to the first input integer.
- `a` is updated to the second input integer.
- `b` is updated to the third input integer.

The expression being evaluated in the `print` statement is:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]

Let's break it down:

1. `b - a` gives the difference between the second and first input integers.
2. `b - a + 1` adds 1 to this difference.
3. `(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)` multiplies these two values.
4. `// 2` performs integer division by 2.
5. `a \times n` multiplies the first input integer by the input integer `n`.

So, the expression calculates the sum of the first `b - a` positive integers (which is the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series starting from 1), plus `a` times `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the above expression, where `a` and `b` are the second and third input integers, respectively, and `n` is the first input integer.

Output: **int((input_integer3 - input_integer2) * (input_integer3 - input_integer2 + 1) // 2 + input_integer2 * input_integer1)**
