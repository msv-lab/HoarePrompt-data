Postcondition: `q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i, q // i]` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`, and after the if-else block executes, `i` is added to itself in the list `M`. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `q // i` is also added to the list `M`.
