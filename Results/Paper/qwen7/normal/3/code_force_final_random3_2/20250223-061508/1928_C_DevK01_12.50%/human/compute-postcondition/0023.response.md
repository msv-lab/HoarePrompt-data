Output State: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i, q // i]` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`, and `M` is updated by adding `q // i` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. The values of `q`, `x`, `w`, and the condition `i` being a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1` remain unchanged. The list `M` now includes the new value `q // i`.
