Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions to complete one full cycle.

3. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` which calculates possible values of `k` for the first part of the settling pattern.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it also calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` for the second part of the settling pattern.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates possible values of `k` using a mathematical approach.
   - It first checks if `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`) is a perfect square.
   - Then it iterates through all divisors of `q` and adds those divisors to the list `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the unique values in `L1` after processing both parts of the settling pattern.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0` because no valid `k` exists.
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies potential `k` values by checking divisors and perfect squares.
  - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that the second part of the settling pattern is considered only when necessary.

- **Mathematical Correctness:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies divisors and perfect squares that could represent valid `k` values.
  - The use of set to remove duplicates before calculating the length ensures the output is unique.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
