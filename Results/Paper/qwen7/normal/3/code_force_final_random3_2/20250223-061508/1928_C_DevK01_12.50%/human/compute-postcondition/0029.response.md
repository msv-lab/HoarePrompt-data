Output State: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i+1, q // (i+1), i]`**.

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains `[w, i+1, q // (i+1)]`. After appending `i`, the updated list `M` becomes `[w, i+1, q // (i+1), i]`. All other variables (`q`, `x`, `w`) remain unchanged.
