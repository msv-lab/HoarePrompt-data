Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `M` is a list containing `[w]`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` (which is the square root of `q`) to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially empty, after this operation, `M` contains `[w]`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial states.
