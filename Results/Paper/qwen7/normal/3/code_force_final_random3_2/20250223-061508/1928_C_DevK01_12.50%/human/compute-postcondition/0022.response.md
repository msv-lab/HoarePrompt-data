Postcondition: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i, q // i]` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`; otherwise, `M` remains unchanged, and `i` is `w - 1`. After the if-else block executes, `i` is added to itself in the list `M`.**
