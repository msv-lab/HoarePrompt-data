Output State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SFSF'` or `'FFSF'`, `j` is `3`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `j` is `3`, `xx[i][j - 1]` refers to `xx[i][2]`. Since `i` is less than `4` and `xx[i][2]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated by appending the value of `xx[i][2]` to `nx`. The original value of `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`, so appending another character results in either `'SFSF'` or `'FFSF'`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
