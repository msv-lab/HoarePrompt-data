Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is an input string, `j` is 4, `a[4]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[4]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `n` must still be at least 3, `x` remains an input string, `j` remains 4, and `a[4]` is increased by 1.
