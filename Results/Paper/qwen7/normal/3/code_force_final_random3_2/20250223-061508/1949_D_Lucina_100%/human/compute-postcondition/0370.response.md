Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'xS'**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`. Given that `nx` was originally either `'x', 'S', 'F', 'xS', 'FS', 'SF', 'xF'`, after adding `'S'` to `nx`, the possible values for `nx` become `'xS', 'SS', 'FS', 'xSS', 'FSS', 'SSF', 'xFSS'`. However, since `nx` could only be one of the specified values initially, the only valid concatenation is `nx` becoming `'xS'`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
