Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `x[j-1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1 or unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with either `b[2]` or `b[i]` increased by 1 or 2 respectively, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`.
