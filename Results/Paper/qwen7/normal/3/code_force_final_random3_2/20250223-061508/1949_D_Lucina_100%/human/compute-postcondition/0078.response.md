Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) is now `2`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()` where `x[0]` is `'F'`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the element at index `n + 1` in list `a` is incremented by 1. Initially, since `a` is a list of length `n + 1` and assuming it was initialized with zeros, the value at index `n + 1` would be `1`. After executing the code, it becomes `2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
