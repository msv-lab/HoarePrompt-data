Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive), so `j` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is a list of characters.
   - `j` is `previous_j + 1`.
   - `n` is such that `previous_j + 1 <= n`.
   - The character at `x[previous_j]` is either 'F' or 'S'.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes occur to `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `previous_j + 2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `previous_j + 2 <= n`.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is updated to `previous_j + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 2, and `n` is such that previous_j + 2 <= n. The character at `x[previous_j + 1]` must be either 'F' or 'S'. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character at `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes occur to `a[j]` and `b[j]`.**
