Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `i` is initially 2.
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `x` is an input string.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be such that the condition `1 <= j < n + 1` holds true.
   - Since `n` is at least 4, the smallest possible value for `n` that allows the loop to execute is 4 (since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n + 1`).

5. **Final State**:
   - The variable `i` is not involved in the loop condition and its initial value of 2 does not affect the loop execution.
   - The variable `x` is not involved in the loop condition and its initial value as an input string does not affect the loop execution.
   - Therefore, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`, which must be at least 4.

**State:**
**`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input string**
