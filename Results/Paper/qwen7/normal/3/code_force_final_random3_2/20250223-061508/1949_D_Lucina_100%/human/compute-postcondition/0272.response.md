Output State: **i is 3, n is 3, a[3] is 0, b[3] is 0, sa is [1, 2, 3], sb is [2, 2, 3].**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, which is 3. The loop condition `if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:` checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero before appending `i` to `sb`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will append 2 and 3 to `sb` in the first and second iterations respectively. In the third iteration, `i` is 3, but since `a[3]` and `b[3]` are not specified to be changed within the loop, they remain 0. Therefore, `i` becomes 3, `n` remains 3, `a[3]` is 0, `b[3]` is 0, `sa` remains as the list of numbers from 1 to 3, and `sb` contains [2, 2, 3] after the third iteration.
