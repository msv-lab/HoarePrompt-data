Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'FF', `j` is 6, and `n` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Initially, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. Since the exact value was not specified, we consider both possibilities. In both cases, appending 'F' results in 'FF'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
