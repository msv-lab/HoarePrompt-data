Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The length of `b` is `n + 1`, which is the same as the length of `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is still a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros. Therefore, `b` is also a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
