Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 5, and `n` is 4. If `xx[5][4]` is not '?', then `nx` is the value of `xx[5][4]` plus itself (which means `nx` is doubled). Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
