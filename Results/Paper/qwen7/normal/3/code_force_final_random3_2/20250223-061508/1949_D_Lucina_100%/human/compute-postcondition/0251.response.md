Postcondition: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, `nx` is either 'F' followed by the character in `xx[i][j - 1]` or 'FS', `j` is `j + 1`, and `n` is the same. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is 'F' followed by the character in `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F' followed by the character in `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'FS'.**
