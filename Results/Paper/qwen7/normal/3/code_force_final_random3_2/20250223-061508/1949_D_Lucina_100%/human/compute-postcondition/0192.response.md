Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially 5.
   - `n` is initially 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will start with `j = 1` and continue until `j = n + 1 - 1`, which is `j = 4` in this case.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range [1, n + 1).
   - Given `n = 4`, the loop will run for `j` values from 1 to 4 inclusive.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is currently 5, it is outside the range [1, 5). Therefore, the loop will not execute with the current state.
   - We need to adjust `j` to be within the range [1, 5) for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is '', `j` must be within the range [1, 5), `n` is 4**
