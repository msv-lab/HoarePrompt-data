Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is incremented by 1. Since no initial value for `a` is provided, we assume `a[1]` was initially 1 (as it needs to be incremented), making it 2 now. All other variables remain unchanged.
