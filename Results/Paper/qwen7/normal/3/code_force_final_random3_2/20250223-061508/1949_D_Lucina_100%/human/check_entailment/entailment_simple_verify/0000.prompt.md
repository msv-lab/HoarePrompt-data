You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` (indicating the loop has completed `n` iterations), and `j` will be `n + 1` (as the inner loop also completes its iterations).

    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached `n + 1`. The conditions inside the loop ensure that every index `i` from 1 to `n` is added to both `sa` and `sb` lists. Since the loop continues as long as there are indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` or `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and given that these conditions are met for all `i` from 1 to `n` (as per the provided states), each index `i` will be appended to both `sa` and `sb` exactly once. By the end of the loop, all indices from 1 to `n` will be present in both `sa` and `sb`, making them identical lists containing the numbers from 1 to `n`. Additionally, since the loop increments `i` but does not modify `a[i]` or `b[i]` within the loop body when appending to `sa` and `sb`, these lists will contain zeros for `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

The variable `j` will be `n + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 + 5 = 10` because `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. The variable `nx` will be 'FFS' because the loop processes `j` values from 1 to 4, and based on the given conditions, it appends 'F' twice and 'S' once to `nx`. The variable `total` remains 0 as there is no operation modifying it in the provided loop body.

The exact content of `nx` depends on the value of `xx[4][2]`, as well as whether `i` (which remains 4) and `j` (which reaches 3) are in the specified sublists `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`. Since the loop runs for `n` which is 3, `i` will always be 4 by the end of the loop, and `j` will be 3 after the last iteration.
    #State: `i` is 6, `n` is 4, `j` is 10, `nx` is 'FFS', and both `sa` and `sb` are identical lists containing the numbers from 1 to 4, with `a[i]` and `b[i]` being 0 for all `i` from 1 to 4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. 

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
.F???
.?F?.
.??.F
???F.
?????
```

The program's output for this input is:
```
.FFFF
.FFFF
.FFFF
.FFFF
.FFFF
```

However, this output is incorrect because for the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sequence of transition videos would be `FFFFF`, which has 5 consecutive 'F' (funny) videos, violating the condition of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for any permutation of the scenarios, the sequence of transition videos does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm that considers all possible permutations and ensures the constraint is met.
