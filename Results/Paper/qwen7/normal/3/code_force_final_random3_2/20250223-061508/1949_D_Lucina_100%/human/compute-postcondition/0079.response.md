Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `j` (which is `1`) is now `2`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()` where `x[0]` is `'F'`.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in list `a` by 1. Given that `j` is `1`, the value at index `1` of list `a` changes from its original value (which was `2` because `i` is `n + 1` and `a[i]` was set to `2`) to `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
