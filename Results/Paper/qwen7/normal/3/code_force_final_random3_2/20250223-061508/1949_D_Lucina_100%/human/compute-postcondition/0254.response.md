Based on the initial state provided and the explanation of how the variables evolve during the loop iterations, we can determine the value of `nx` when the `print(nx)` statement is executed.

- `total` remains 0.
- `i` remains 6.
- `nx` is 'FFS' after the third iteration and does not change further.
- `j` is 10.
- `n` is 4.

The `print(nx)` statement will print the current value of `nx`, which is 'FFS'.

Output: **FFS**
