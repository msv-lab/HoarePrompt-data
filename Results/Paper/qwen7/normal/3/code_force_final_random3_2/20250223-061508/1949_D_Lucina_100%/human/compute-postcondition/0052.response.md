Postcondition: `x` is a list of characters, and `j` is an index within the list `x`. If the character at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then the value of `a[j]` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then the value of `b[j]` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the code raises a TypeError because `b[j]` is a string.
