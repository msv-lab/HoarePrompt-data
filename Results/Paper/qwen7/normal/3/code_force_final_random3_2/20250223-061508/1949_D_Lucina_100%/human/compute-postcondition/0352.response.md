Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` must be 1, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string (`''`). After appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.
