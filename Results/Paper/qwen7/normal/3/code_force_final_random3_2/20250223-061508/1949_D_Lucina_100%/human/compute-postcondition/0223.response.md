Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 5
   - `nx` is 'FFS'
   - `j` is 7
   - `n` is 4

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `n + 1`. Since `n` is 4, the loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `5`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - **`i`**: The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `6` (since `n + 1` is 5). Therefore, `i` must be set to 6 for the loop to continue.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains 4.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - **`total`**: The problem statement mentions that `total` remains 0 as there is no operation modifying it in the provided loop body.
   - **`nx`**: The problem statement does not specify any changes to `nx` within the loop, so it remains 'FFS'.
   - **`j`**: The value of `j` is not relevant to the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 6, `nx` is 'FFS', `j` is 7, and `n` is 4**
