Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element has been incremented based on the occurrences of 'F' across all input strings stored in `xx`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element has been incremented based on the occurrences of 'S' across all input strings stored in `xx`, `xx` contains all the input strings provided during the loop executions, `sa` is an empty list, `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()` for each iteration, `sb` is an empty list.**

The code `sb = []` initializes an empty list `sb`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
