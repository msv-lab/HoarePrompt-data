Output State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`, `j` is `2`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was either `'S'` or `'F'`, after appending 'F', `nx` becomes either `'SF'` or `'FF'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
