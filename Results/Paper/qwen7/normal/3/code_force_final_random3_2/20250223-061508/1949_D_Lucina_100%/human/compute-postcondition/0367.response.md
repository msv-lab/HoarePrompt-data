Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 2, and `nx` is either 'x', 'S', 'F', 'xS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'xF'. If `xx[4][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to 'x', 'S', or 'F' based on the original conditions. If `xx[4][1]` is '?', then `nx` is updated to 'xS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'xF' based on whether `i` or `j` is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.
