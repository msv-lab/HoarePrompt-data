Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 5
   - `nx` is either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx'
   - `j` is 4
   - `n` is 4

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - Since `n` is 4, the loop will run 4 times (from `i = 1` to `i = 4`).

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5, which means the loop has completed all its iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = 4`).
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `i` is now 5 and the loop condition `i < n + 1` (which is `i < 5`) is no longer satisfied.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop head variable `i`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of the loop, but since the loop does not execute again, `i` remains 5.

6. **Final state**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `i` remains 5.
   - `nx` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx').
   - `j` remains 4.
   - `n` remains 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not exist since the loop does not execute again) would be:

**State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx', `j` is 4, `n` is 4.**
