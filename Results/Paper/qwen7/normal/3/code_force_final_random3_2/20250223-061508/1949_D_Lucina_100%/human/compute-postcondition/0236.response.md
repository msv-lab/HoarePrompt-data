Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' based on the following conditions:
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' based on whether `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. If either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
