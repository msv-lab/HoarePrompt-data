Output State: **`xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` is an index within the bounds of `xx`, and `j - 1` is an index within the bounds of `xx[i]`; `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` does not contain `i` and does not contain `j`; `nx` is 'S' added to the previous value of `nx`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The values of `xx`, `i`, `j`, `sa`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
