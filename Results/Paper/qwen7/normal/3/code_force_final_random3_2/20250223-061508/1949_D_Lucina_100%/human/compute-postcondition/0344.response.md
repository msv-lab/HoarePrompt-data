Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `j` is 4
   - `nx` is 'FSSF'

4. **Determine if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n + 1`.
   - Substituting the current values: `4 < 3 + 1` which simplifies to `4 < 4`.
   - Since `4` is not less than `4`, the loop cannot continue.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop cannot continue, no changes are needed for the loop head variables `i` and `n`.
   - The variables `j` and `nx` are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is the end of the loop) remains the same as the current state.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is 'FSSF'**
