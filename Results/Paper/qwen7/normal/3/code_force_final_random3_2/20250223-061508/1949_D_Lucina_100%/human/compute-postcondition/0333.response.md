Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `j` is 4
   - `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SF'
   - Additional condition for `nx`: If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'SS', 'SF', 'FS', or 'FF'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'FS' if `i` or `j` is present in the substring `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'SF' otherwise.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j in range(1, n + 1)`. Since `n` is 3, the valid range for `j` is from 1 to 3.

4. **Current value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4. This means the loop has already completed its iterations for `j = 1, 2, 3`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `j` is currently 4 and the loop range is from 1 to 3, the loop cannot execute again because `j` exceeds the upper limit of the range.

6. **Final state**: The state remains unchanged as the loop does not execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SF'**
