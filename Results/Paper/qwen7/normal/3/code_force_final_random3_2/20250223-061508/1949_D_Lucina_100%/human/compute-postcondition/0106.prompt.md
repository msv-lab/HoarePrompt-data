Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged, `x` is assigned the value of `input()`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is either `1` or `2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[j]` increased by 1 if `j` is `2`, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`. If `x[j - 1]` is `'F'`, then `a[j]` is `2`. Otherwise, `j` is set to `2` and `b[j]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `x[j-1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `j` increased by 1 or unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with either `b[2]` increased by 1 or `b[i]` increased by 2, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3 or 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `j` increased by 1 or unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with either `b[2]` increased by 1 or `b[i]` increased by 2 or 3, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from input().




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
