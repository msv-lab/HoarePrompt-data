Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `n + 1` increased by 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[2]` increased by 1, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` in list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the element at index `n + 1` in list `a` is increased by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
