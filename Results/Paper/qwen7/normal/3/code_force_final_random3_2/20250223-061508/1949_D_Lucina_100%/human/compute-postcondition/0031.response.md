Output State: **`i` is 1; `b[i]` is increased by 1; `n` must be at least 3; `x` is an input string; `j` is 4**.

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
