Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is 'FF', `j` is 3, `n` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is originally either 'F' or 'S'. In this case, it is updated by concatenating the string 'F' to its current value. Since the initial value of `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', after the operation, it becomes either 'FF' or 'SF'. However, since the exact initial value of `nx` is not specified beyond being 'F' or 'S', we can only definitively say it becomes 'FF'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
