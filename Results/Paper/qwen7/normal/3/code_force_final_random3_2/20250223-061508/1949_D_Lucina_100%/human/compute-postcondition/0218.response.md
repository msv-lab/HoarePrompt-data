Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS', `j` is 6, and `n` is 4. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` remains either 'FF' or 'FS'. Additionally, if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` becomes 'FF'. Otherwise, `nx` becomes 'FS'.
