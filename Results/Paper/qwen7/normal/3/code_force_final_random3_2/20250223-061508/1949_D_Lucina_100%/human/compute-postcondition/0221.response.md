Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'FFS', `j` is 7, and `n` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (4 times since `n` is 4), the variable `j` will be `n + 1 = 5 + 2 = 7` because `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. The variable `nx` will be 'FFS' because the loop processes `j` values from 1 to 4, and based on the given conditions, it appends 'F' twice and 'S' once to `nx`. The variable `i` remains 5 as it is not modified within the loop, and `total` remains 0 as there is no operation modifying it in the provided loop body.
