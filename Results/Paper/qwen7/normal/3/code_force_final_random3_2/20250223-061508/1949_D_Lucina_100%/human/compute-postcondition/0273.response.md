Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 3.
   - `n` is initially 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `i` should be between 1 and `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Check the current value of `i` and `n`**:
   - Currently, `i` is 3.
   - `n` is 3.
   - Since `i` is equal to `n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not in the range `[1, n + 1)`.

5. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**: To make the loop execute, `i` must be in the range `[1, n + 1)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given the initial values, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is 3, `i` should be less than 4.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be less than `n + 1` (which is 4).
- `n` remains 3.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3**.
