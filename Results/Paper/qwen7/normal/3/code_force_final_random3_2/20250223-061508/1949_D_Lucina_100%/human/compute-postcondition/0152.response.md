Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `a[3]` is 0, `b[3]` is 0, `sa` is [1, 2, 3, 4], `sb` is [1, 2, 3]

Explanation: If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is updated to include the value of `i` (which is 4). The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `a[3]`, `b[3]`, and `sb`) remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, these variables retain their original values if the condition is not met.
