Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 500.
Code of the loop:
for e in range(t):
    l = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = 0
    y = 100000000
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i] > x:
            x = nums[i]
        if nums[i] < y:
            y = nums[i]
    print(x - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` is the total length of the list `nums`, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `l-1`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is the input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
