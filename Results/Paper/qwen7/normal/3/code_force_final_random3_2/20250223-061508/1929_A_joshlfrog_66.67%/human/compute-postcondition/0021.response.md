Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input, `x` is equal to `nums[i]`, `y` is equal to `nums[i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `i` is initially 1, `y` will have the same value as `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
