Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `e`. The loop runs from `0` to `t-1`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` equals `l-1`
   - `e` is 1
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`
   - `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `e < t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be incremented by 1 and should still satisfy the condition `e < t`.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop variable `e` is being incremented by 1, `e` will become `2` (assuming `t > 2`). There is no change required for `i`, `l`, `x`, or `y` as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `e`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` equals `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`**
