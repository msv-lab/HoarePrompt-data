You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It finds the maximum and minimum values in each list and calculates the difference between these values. The function prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the differences for all cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and printing their difference. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `l` is the length of the array.
   - `nums` is the list of array elements.

2. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - `x` is initialized to 0 and `y` is initialized to 100000000 (a large value).
   - The program iterates through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values.

3. **Printing Result:**
   - The result is printed as `x - y`.

### Reasoning
- The logic of finding the maximum and minimum values and calculating their difference does not directly address the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
- The program assumes that the maximum difference between any two elements in the array will be the maximum possible beauty, which is not necessarily true. The beauty depends on the arrangement of elements such that the positive differences outweigh the negative ones.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** 
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `3` and `1` respectively
  - Output: `3 - 1 = 2`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[1, 2, 3]`, the beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `69` and `69` respectively
  - Output: `69 - 69 = 0`
  - Correct Output: The beauty remains `0` since all elements are the same.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `100` and `43` respectively
  - Output: `100 - 43 = 57`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, the beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `4` and `3` respectively
  - Output: `4 - 3 = 1`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, the beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Maximum and Minimum: `2` and `1` respectively
  - Output: `2 - 1 = 1`
  - Correct Output: By rearranging to `[1, 2]`, the beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

### Conclusion
While the program correctly outputs the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values, it does not ensure that the beauty is maximized by rearranging the array. Therefore, the program does not fully solve the problem as required.
