Output State: **`i` is less than `l`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `nums[i]` is specified to be greater than 0, `x` will also be a positive integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
