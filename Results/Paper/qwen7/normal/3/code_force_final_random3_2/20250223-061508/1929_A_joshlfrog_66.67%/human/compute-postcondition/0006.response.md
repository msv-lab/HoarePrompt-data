Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (as is typical for `range(l)`).
   - `l` is the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `l` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states based on the above conditions**:
   - `t`, `e`, `x`, and `y` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.
   - `i` is set to 0 by default when the loop starts.
   - `l` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` (which must be at least 1) and `i` (which is already set to 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000**
