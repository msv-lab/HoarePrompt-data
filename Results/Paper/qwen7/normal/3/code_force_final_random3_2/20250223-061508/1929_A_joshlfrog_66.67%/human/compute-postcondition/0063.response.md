Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `l-1`.
- `e` is 1.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`.

The print statement is `print(x - y)`, which calculates the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) found in the list `nums`.

Since `x` is the maximum value in `nums` and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, the expression `x - y` computes the range of the values in the list `nums`.

Output: **the range of values in the list nums (x - y)**
