Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`, `l` is updated to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `l`. The other variables (`i`, `e`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged with their respective values or conditions as per the initial state.
