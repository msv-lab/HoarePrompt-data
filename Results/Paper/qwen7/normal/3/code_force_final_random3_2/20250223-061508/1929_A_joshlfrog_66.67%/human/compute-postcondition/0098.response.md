Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each 't' test cases, 'n' is an integer between 2 and 100 followed by 'n' integers 'a_1, a_2, ..., a_n' each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns results based on the processed input data for each test case.**
