Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `nums[2]`, `x` is assigned the value of `nums[i]` which is `nums[2]`.**

In this case, the value of `x` is updated to be equal to the element at index `i` in the list `nums`, which is `nums[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
