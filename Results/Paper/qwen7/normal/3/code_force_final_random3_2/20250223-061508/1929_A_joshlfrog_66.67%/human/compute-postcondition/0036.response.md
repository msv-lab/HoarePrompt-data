Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is 0, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.**

The code sets `x` to 0, which updates the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
