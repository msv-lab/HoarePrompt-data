Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is `nums[i]`, `y` is equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `y`, and if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `e`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` was initially `i + 2`, so it stays as `i + 2`. `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, and `y` is defined based on whether `nums[i]` is greater than `y` or not.
