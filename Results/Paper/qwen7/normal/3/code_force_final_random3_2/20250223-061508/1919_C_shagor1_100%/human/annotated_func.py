#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It verifies that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \) for each element in the list. If the conditions are met, it returns a result indicating that the test case is valid; otherwise, it indicates that the test case is invalid.
