You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `k` will be 0, and `nums` will be a list where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
    #- For each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
    #- Then, `k` is decreased by `nums[i]`.
    #
    #Since `k` starts as some positive value and is decreased by a value that depends on its bit length, eventually `k` will become 0 after enough iterations. When `k` reaches 0, the subtraction operation will no longer change `k`, and since `n` is decremented with each iteration, `n` will also reach 0.
    #
    #Each time through the loop, `nums[i]` is set to a value based on the current bit length of `k`. As `k` decreases, the bit length of `k` decreases, and thus the value of `nums[i]` will be adjusted accordingly. By the end of the loop, `nums` will contain the sequence of values that were assigned to it during the iterations, and `k` will be 0.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, and the last element of `nums` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums` and `k` is an integer. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with zeros. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it sets `nums[i]` to a value derived from the bit length of `k`, specifically `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and then decreases `k` by this value. After the loop, it adjusts the last element of `nums` by adding any remaining value of `k`. Finally, it returns the list `nums`. The returned list contains the sequence of values assigned to it during the iterations, with zeros in the positions not affected by the loop, and the last element set to zero.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of `n` integers that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then iterates through the array, setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1.
   - After setting each element, it subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the sum of the array equals `k`.

3. **Binary OR Operation Consideration:**
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements.
   - The approach taken in `func_1` sets most elements to the largest possible value with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1, which ensures that the OR operation will include many 1s.
   - However, the last element is adjusted to make sure the sum of the array equals `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is small enough, some elements might be zero, but the OR operation still includes many 1s.
   - The approach handles the sum constraint correctly by adjusting the last element.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `1 5`
  - Expected output: `5`
  - Explanation: The only integer is 5, and the sum is 5.
- **Test Case 2:** `2 3`
  - Expected output: `1 2`
  - Explanation: `1 + 2 = 3`, and `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones.
- **Test Case 3:** `2 5`
  - Expected output: `5 0`
  - Explanation: `5 + 0 = 5`, and `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which has 2 ones.
- **Test Case 4:** `6 51`
  - Expected output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
  - Explanation: `3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51`, and `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101111` (binary), which has 5 ones.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of integers that meet the criteria. The function `func_1` ensures the sum is correct and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary OR operation.
