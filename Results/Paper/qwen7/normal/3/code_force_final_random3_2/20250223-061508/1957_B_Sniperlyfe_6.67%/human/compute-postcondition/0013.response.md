Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, and the last element of `nums` is 0.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is 0 and `k` is 0.
- The list `nums` is constructed such that each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise.
- Since `k` is 0, `k.bit_length()` is also 0, making the expression `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` evaluate to `(1 << (-1)) - 1`, which is not valid as bit_length of 0 does not allow negative shift. However, considering the context, if `k` is 0, no elements should be set in `nums` other than the last element which is explicitly set to `k` (i.e., 0).
- Therefore, `nums` will be a list of zeros, and the last element will be 0.

Hence, the program returns a list where all elements are 0, and the last element is 0.
