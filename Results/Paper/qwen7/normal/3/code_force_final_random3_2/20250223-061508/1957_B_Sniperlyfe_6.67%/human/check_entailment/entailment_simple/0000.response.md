Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the list, setting each element to \((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1\), which is the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k`.
   - After setting these values, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The value \((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1\) is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k`. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the numbers will have many 1s.
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, meaning all elements are filled.
   - The last element is adjusted to make sure the total sum is `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k \) is 0, the function correctly sets all elements to 0.
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, the function correctly distributes the value among the elements.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the sum of the elements is `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the elements will have the maximum number of 1s because each element is set to the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k`.

Based on the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly constructs the required sequence.

Correctness: **True**
