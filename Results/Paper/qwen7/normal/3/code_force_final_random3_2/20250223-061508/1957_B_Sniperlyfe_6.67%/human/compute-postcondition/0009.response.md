Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is updated such that `nums[2]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) - 1`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `k` is calculated as `k - 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- After executing `k -= nums[i]`, `k` is further reduced by the value of `nums[i]`, which is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) - 1`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.
- The value of `nums[2]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.
