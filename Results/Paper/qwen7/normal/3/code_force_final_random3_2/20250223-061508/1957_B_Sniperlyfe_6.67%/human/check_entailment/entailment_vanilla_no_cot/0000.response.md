Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to set most of the numbers to the highest possible value with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits set to 1 (i.e., `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`). This approach does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - For example, if `k = 3`, the highest value with 2 bits set to 1 is `3` (binary `11`). However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Simpler Correct Approach**:
   - A better approach would be to distribute the value `k` among the `n` elements in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. One effective strategy is to set all but one element to 0 and the last element to `k`. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will be `k`, which is the maximum possible value for a single integer with `k` bits set to 1.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    # Distribute k among n-1 elements as 0 and the last element as k
    result = [0] * (n - 1) + [k]
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))
```

This corrected program will ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized while satisfying the sum constraint.
