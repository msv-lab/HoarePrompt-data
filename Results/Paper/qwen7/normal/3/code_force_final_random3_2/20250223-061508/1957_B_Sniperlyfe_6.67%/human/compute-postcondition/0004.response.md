Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0.
   - The loop decrements `k` by `nums[i]`, where `nums[i]` is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be 1 (assuming it was 0 in the previous iteration), and `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was 0 before, it will be 1 now.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated state should reflect these changes:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
