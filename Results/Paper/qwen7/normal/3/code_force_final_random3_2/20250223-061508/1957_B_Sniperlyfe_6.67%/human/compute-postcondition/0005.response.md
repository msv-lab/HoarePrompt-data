Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `nums[i]` is 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `nums[i]`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `k`, so we express the value of `nums[i]` in terms of `k`. The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` calculates a value based on the bit length of `k`. Since the exact value of `k` is not given, we keep it in its symbolic form. The other variables remain unchanged.
