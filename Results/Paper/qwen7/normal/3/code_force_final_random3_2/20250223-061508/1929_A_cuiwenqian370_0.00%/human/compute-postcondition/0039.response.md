Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[4]` and `new_arr[3]`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code updates `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, `new_arr[i]` refers to `new_arr[4]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` refers to `new_arr[3]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged.
