Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` in a specific order.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, meaning `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 0. The `new_arr` list will contain all elements from the original array `arr`, but in a specific order where elements from the end of the array are added before elements from the beginning, except when `left` equals `right`, in which case only one element is appended.
