Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `n` and the range of integers within `arr` remain unchanged, but the list `arr` itself is now sorted.
