Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is `right - 1`, and `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and at least one of `arr[1]` or `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1, so `right` becomes `right - 1`. The values of `left` and `new_arr` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
