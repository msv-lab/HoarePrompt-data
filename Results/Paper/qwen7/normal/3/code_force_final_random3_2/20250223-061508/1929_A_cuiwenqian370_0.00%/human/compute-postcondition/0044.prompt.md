You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` in a specific order.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, meaning `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 0. The `new_arr` list will contain all elements from the original array `arr`, but in a specific order where elements from the end of the array are added before elements from the beginning, except when `left` equals `right`, in which case only one element is appended.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `max_beauty` will hold the total beauty calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between every adjacent pair of elements in the `new_arr` list, starting from `new_arr[1]` up to `new_arr[n-1]`. The value of `i` will be `n`, and the loop will have iterated `n-1` times, covering all possible pairs of consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
    return max_beauty
    #`The program returns max_beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in new_arr from index 1 to n-1`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, and returns the maximum beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1.

```

Return Postconditions: `The program returns max_beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in new_arr from index 1 to n-1`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
