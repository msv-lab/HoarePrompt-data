Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the element `arr[0]`, and the current value of `left` is equal to `right`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `left` (which is 0) from the array `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Since `left` was initially equal to `right`, and no changes were made to `right`, its value remains unchanged. `new_arr` now contains one element, which is `arr[0]`.
