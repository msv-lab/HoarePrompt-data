Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - In `func_1`, the array is sorted and then rearranged by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - Sorting the array helps in easily pairing the smallest and largest elements.
   - Alternating between the smallest and largest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between these pairs gives the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, sorting and rearranging will not change the beauty, which should be zero.
   - If the array has only two distinct values, the maximum beauty is the difference between these values multiplied by the number of elements minus one.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the solution.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the rearrangement and calculation of the beauty.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
