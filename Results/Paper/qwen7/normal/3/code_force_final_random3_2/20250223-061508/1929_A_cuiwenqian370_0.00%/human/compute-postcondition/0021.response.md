Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is greater than or equal to 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and at least one of `arr[1]` or `arr[right]`, depending on whether `left` equals `right`.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The conditions and values of `right` and `new_arr` remain unchanged from the initial state.
