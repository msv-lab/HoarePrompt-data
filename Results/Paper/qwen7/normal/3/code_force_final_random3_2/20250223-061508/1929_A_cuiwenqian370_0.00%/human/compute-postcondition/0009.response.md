Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the element `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `right` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Since `right` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` will contain one element, which is `arr[right]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged from their initial state.
