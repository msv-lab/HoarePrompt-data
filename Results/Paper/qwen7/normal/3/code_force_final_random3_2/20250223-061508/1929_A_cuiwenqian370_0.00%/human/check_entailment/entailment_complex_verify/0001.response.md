### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
   - The provided solution sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements to construct a new array `new_arr`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, arr)` to compute the maximum beauty.
   - In `func_1`, the array is sorted and then rearranged by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - Sorting the array helps in easily pairing the smallest and largest elements.
   - Alternating between the smallest and largest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between these pairs gives the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, sorting and rearranging will not change the beauty, which should be zero.
   - If the array has only two distinct values, the maximum beauty is the difference between these values multiplied by the number of elements minus one.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the solution.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the rearrangement and calculation of the beauty.

However, upon closer inspection of the `func_1` function, we notice that the logic of constructing `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest elements is flawed. Specifically, the construction of `new_arr` does not ensure that the maximum beauty is achieved. Instead, it alternates between the smallest and largest elements without considering the optimal arrangement.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should consider the following approach:
- Sort the array.
- Pair the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(n // 2):
        max_beauty += abs(arr[i] - arr[-(i + 1)])
    if n % 2 == 1:
        max_beauty += arr[n // 2]
    return max_beauty
```

This function correctly pairs the smallest and largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided solution does not correctly construct the array to maximize the beauty. The corrected approach involves sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to achieve the maximum beauty.

**Final: False**
