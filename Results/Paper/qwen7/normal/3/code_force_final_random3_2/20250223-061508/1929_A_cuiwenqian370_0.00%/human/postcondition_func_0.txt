The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it constructs a new list `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and beginning of the sorted list, except when only one element remains, in which case it adds that element. Finally, it calculates and returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
