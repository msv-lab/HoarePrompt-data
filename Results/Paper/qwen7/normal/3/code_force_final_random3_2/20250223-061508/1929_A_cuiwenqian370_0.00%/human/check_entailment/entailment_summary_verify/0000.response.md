### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The key insight is to arrange the elements such that the positive differences are maximized and the negative differences are minimized.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` sorts the array.
- It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
- Finally, it calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array helps in potentially maximizing the differences.
2. **Alternating Elements**: Alternating between the smallest and largest elements ensures that the largest possible differences are used.
3. **Maximizing Beauty**: The approach aims to maximize the sum of positive differences and minimize the sum of negative differences.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
3
4
10 5 15 20
```

- **Original Array**: `[10, 5, 15, 20]`
- **Sorted Array**: `[5, 10, 15, 20]`
- **New Array (`new_arr`)**: `[20, 5, 15, 10]` (alternating from the end and start of the sorted array)
- **Beauty Calculation**: 
  \[
  (20 - 5) + (5 - 15) + (15 - 10) = 15 - 10 + 5 = 10
  \]

This calculation is incorrect according to the problem statement. The correct rearrangement should be `[10, 20, 5, 15]` to achieve the maximum beauty:
\[
(20 - 10) + (5 - 20) + (15 - 5) = 10 - 15 + 10 = 5
\]

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This is effectively what the function summary describes.

Given the function summary and the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty of the array. The original assessment is accurate.
