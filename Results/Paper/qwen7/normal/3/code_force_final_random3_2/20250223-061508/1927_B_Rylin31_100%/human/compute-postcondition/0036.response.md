Output State: **`ans` is the string 'aa', `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an updated input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `array`. The initial values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged. The `array` variable now holds the newly created list of integers.
