Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `array` that haven't been processed yet.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `j` is the current element from the list `s`, and `s[j]` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is the current element being processed in the loop, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be updated to the next element in the list `s`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97`, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0, `j` is the next element from the list `s` (i.e., `j+1`)**.
