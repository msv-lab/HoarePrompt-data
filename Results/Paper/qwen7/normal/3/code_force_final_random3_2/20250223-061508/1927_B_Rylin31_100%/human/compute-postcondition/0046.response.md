Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 't', the character at index `j-2` in `ans` is 'b', and the character at index `j-1` in `ans` is 'c', and the character at index `j` in `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Given the initial state, the string `ans` ends with 't', and the characters at indices `j-2` and `j-1` are 'b' and 'c' respectively. The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the character at index `j` in the string `ans` by 1. Since the character at index `j` is 'c', incrementing it by 1 results in 'd'. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
