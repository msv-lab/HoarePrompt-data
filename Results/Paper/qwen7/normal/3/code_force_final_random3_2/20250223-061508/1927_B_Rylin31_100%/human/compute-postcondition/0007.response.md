Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a' + the character corresponding to the value of `s[j]` + 97, and `s[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The initial state of `ans` is described such that its last character is derived from the value of `s[j]`. After executing the code, `s[j]` is increased by 1, but the exact value of `ans` remains unchanged because the calculation for the last character of `ans` depends on the new value of `s[j]`, which is now one more than its original value.
