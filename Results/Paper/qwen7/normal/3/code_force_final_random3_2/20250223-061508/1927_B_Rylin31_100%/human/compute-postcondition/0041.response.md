Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `for j in array`. This means the loop variable `j` is taken from the `array`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a string where the last character is 'a'.
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - The character at index `j-1` in `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the bounds of the `array`. Since `j` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, it will be checked against the length of `array` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it is not directly modified by the loop itself but by the character at index `j-1`.
   - `j` is increased by 1 from the previous value.
   - The character at index `j-1` in `ans` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Given that `j` is increased by 1, let's assume the initial value of `j` was `k` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration). After the increment, `j` becomes `k + 1`.

Since the character at index `j-1` in `ans` is incremented, the new character at index `j-2` (which was `j-1` in the previous iteration) will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a', `j` is increased by 1 from its previous value, and the character at index `j-2` in `ans` is incremented by 1**.
