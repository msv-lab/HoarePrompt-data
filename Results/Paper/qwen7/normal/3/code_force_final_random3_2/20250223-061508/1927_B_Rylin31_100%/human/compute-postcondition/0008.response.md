Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in array:`. The variables involved here are `j` and `array`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a string where the last character is 'a' + the character corresponding to the value of `s[j]` + 97.
   - `s[j]` is increased by 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `array`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the last element processed from `array`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was the last element processed, the next iteration will start with `j` being the next element in `array`.
   - `s[j]` is increased by 1, so for the next iteration, `s[j]` will be the new value of `s[j]` after the increment.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it depends on the current value of `s[j]`, which changes inside the loop but does not affect the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - `j` will be the next element in `array`.
   - `s[j]` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a' + the character corresponding to the value of `s[j]` + 97, `j` is the next element in `array`, and `s[j]` is the value of `s[j]` after being increased by 1**.
