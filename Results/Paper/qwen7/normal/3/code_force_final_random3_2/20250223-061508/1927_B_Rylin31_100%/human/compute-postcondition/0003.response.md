Output State: **`l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4; `s` is a list of `l` elements, each element being 0; `array` is a list of integers created from input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `array`. The length of `array` is determined by the number of elements in the input, which is the same as `l`. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged, with `s` being a list of `l` elements, each set to 0.
