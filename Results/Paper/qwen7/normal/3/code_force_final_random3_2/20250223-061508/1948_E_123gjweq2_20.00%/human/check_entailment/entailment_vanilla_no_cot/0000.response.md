Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cliques**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`, but this does not necessarily give the optimal number of cliques required to minimize the number of cliques. The problem requires finding the minimum possible number of cliques, which is more complex than just dividing `n` by `k`.

2. **Incorrect Assignment of Values to Vertices**: The assignment of values to vertices (`arr`) and the calculation of cliques (`cliquess`) are done incorrectly. The function `make_array` is supposed to fill the array and set the clique numbers, but it does not correctly handle the logic to ensure that the conditions `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` are satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)`.

3. **Missing Logic to Ensure Conditions**: The code does not include the necessary logic to ensure that the assigned values satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. This is crucial for forming the correct cliques.

4. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: The function `make_array` is defined but not called within `func_1`. Additionally, the function `make_array` uses variables `arr` and `cliquess` that are not defined in its scope unless they are global, which is not a good practice.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that ensures the conditions are met while minimizing the number of cliques. This might involve dynamic programming or other combinatorial optimization techniques.
