Output State: **`i` is 0; `not_mid` is greater than 0; `arr[left + mid + i]` is equal to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` updates the element in the array `arr` at the index `left + mid + i` to be the value of `big_element - i`. Since `i` is initially 0 and does not change within the given code snippet, its value remains 0. The condition that `not_mid` must be greater than 0 is also unchanged.
