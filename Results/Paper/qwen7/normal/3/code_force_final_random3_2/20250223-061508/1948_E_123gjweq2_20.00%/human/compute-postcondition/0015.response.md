Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i < not_mid`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be 0.

3. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < not_mid`. This means `not_mid` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `arr`, `left`, `mid`, `small_element`, `cliquess`, and `clique` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. They are part of the pre-loop state and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `not_mid`.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0**
