Output State: All elements in the array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array are all set to the value of `clique - (not_mid - 1)`, with the exception of the element at `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, which remains equal to `clique`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `arr` array will contain values starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` up to `big_element - 1` from index `left + mid` onwards, spanning a total of `not_mid` elements. Similarly, the `cliquess` array will contain the value `clique - (not_mid - 1)` for each of these indices, except for the last one which retains the original `clique` value if `not_mid` is 1 or greater.
