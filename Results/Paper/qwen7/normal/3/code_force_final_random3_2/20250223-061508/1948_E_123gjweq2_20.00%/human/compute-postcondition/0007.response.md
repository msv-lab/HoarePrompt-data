Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(mid)`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Understand the State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cliquess[left + i]' is set to the value of `clique'.
   - `arr[left + i]' is equal to `small_element + i'.

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `cliquess[left + i]' will now be `cliquess[left + (i + 1)]'.
   - `arr[left + i]' will now be `arr[left + (i + 1)]'.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state should reflect the updated values of `cliquess[left + i]' and `arr[left + i]' for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`cliquess[left + i]' is set to the value of `clique' where i is i + 1, and `arr[left + i]' is equal to `small_element + (i + 1)'**
