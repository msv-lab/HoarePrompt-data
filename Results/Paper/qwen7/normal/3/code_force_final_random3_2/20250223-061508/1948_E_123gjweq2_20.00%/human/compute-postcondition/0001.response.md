Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `big_element` is assigned the value `right + 1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
