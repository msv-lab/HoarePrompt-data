Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is set to the value of `clique`; `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is equal to `small_element + (i + 1)'; `arr[left + i]` remains equal to `small_element + i`.**

Explanation:
- The line `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to be equal to the value of `clique`.
- The values of `arr[left + (i + 1)]` and `arr[left + i]` remain unchanged from their initial states because they are not affected by the given line of code.
