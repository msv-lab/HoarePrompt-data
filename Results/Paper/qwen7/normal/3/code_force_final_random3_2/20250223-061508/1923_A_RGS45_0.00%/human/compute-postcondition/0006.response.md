Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`. This means `z` contains characters from `arr` starting at the position `x` and ending at the position `n - y - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
