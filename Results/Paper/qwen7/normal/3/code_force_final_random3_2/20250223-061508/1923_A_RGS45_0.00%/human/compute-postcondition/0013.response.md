Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- The value of `y` remains unchanged as it is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`.
- The value of `z` is now a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were in the initial state, except for the new definition of `z`.
