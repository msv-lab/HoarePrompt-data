You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The variable `t` will be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the initial value of `t`. For each iteration, `n` will be an input integer, `arr` will be a string input from the user, `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (or -1 if '1' is not found), `y` will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (or -1 if '1' is not found), and `z` will be a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`. After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them, and we need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string representation of the cells where `1` indicates a chip and `0` indicates a free cell.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program attempts to find the positions of the first and last chips (`x` and `y`).
   - It then extracts the substring `z` between these positions.
   - Finally, it counts the number of zeros in `z` and prints it.

4. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The logic does not correctly simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left.
   - The count of zeros in the substring `z` does not represent the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
   - For example, consider the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`. The correct answer should be 1 (move the chip from position 7 to position 5), but the program incorrectly counts the zeros in the substring `111011` which is 3.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the positions of the chips and move them one by one to the left until they form a single block.
   - We can use a greedy approach to always move the rightmost chip to the leftmost available free cell.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
