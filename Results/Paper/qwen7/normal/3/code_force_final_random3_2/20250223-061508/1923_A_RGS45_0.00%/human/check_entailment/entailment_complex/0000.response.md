Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block without any free cells between them, and the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.
2. **Given Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells (`n`) and a binary string (`arr`) representing the cells.
   - It finds the first occurrence (`x`) and the last occurrence (`y`) of '1' in the string.
   - It extracts a substring `z` from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - It counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` and prints the result.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Finding Indices**: The indices `x` and `y` are correctly identified as the positions of the first and last '1' in the string, respectively.
   - **Substring Extraction**: The substring `z` is extracted correctly from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - **Counting '0's**: The count of '0's in the substring `z` is calculated correctly.
   - **Objective**: The objective of forming a single block of chips without any free cells between them is not directly addressed by counting '0's in the substring. Instead, the correct approach would involve moving chips to the leftmost possible positions.

4. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The current approach does not simulate the actual movement of chips to the leftmost possible positions.
   - It only counts the number of '0's in a specific substring, which does not reflect the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to simulate the actual movements of chips to achieve the desired configuration.

Correctness: **False**
