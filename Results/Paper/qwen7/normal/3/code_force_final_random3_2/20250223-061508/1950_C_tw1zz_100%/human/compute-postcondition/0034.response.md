Output State: **`h1` is '06', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is '06'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'06'` to the variable `h1`. Since `h` was previously `'06'` and is not equal to `'05'`, its value remains unchanged. The values of `m1` and `time` remain as they were in the initial state.
