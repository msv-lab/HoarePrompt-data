Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. However, there are several issues with the logic used to determine whether the time is in the AM or PM period:

1. The program uses a series of `elif` statements to manually map each hour from 00 to 23 to its corresponding 12-hour format representation and AM/PM indicator. This approach is inefficient and error-prone.
2. The program does not handle the conversion correctly for hours that are directly between 13 and 23. Instead of converting 13 to 1, 14 to 2, and so on, it incorrectly maps these values back to the 1-12 range without properly adjusting the AM/PM indicator.
3. The program unnecessarily updates `h1`, `m1`, and `time` to reflect the last processed time, rather than printing the converted time for each individual test case.

To fix these issues, the program should use simple arithmetic to determine the 12-hour format and the correct AM/PM indicator. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = int(h) % 12
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f"{h1}:{m} {time}")
```

This corrected version:
1. Uses modulo 12 arithmetic to convert the hour to the 12-hour format.
2. Determines the AM/PM indicator based on whether the original hour is less than 12.
3. Prints the converted time directly for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for determining the 12-hour format and AM/PM indicator. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
