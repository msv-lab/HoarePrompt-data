Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', `h` is not equal to '02', and the current value of `h` is '03'.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `time` to 'AM'. This updates the value of `time` to 'AM'. The other variables (`h1`, `m1`, `h`) retain their original values from the initial state.
