Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is a string representing the hour part of the input.
- `m1` is equal to `m`, where `m` is the minute part of the input.
- `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input.
- `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01', '02', '03', or '04'. Otherwise, `time` is 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the value of `h`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Let's break it down:

1. `h1` is the same as `h`, which is the hour part of the input.
2. `m` is the minute part of the input, and `m1` is equal to `m`.
3. `time` is determined by the value of `h`. If `h` is '01', '02', '03', or '04', then `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `time` could be either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given this, the output will depend on the value of `h`:

- If `h` is '01', '02', '03', or '04', then `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is any other value (e.g., '05', '06', ..., '12'), then `time` is 'AM' or 'PM'.

Therefore, the output will be in the format of `hour : minute AM/PM`.

To provide a precise answer, let's consider both cases:

- If `h` is '01', '02', '03', or '04':
  Output: **h1 : m1 AM**

- If `h` is any other value (e.g., '05', '06', ..., '12'):
  Output: **h1 : m1 AM/PM**

Since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we need to consider both possibilities. However, for clarity, we'll provide the general form:

Output: **h1 : m1 [time]** (where `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01', '02', '03', or '04', and 'AM' or 'PM' otherwise).
