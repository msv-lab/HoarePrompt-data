Functionality: **The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them into the 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators. It prints out each converted time and updates the variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` to reflect the last processed time in the 12-hour format. After processing all inputs, the final state includes `h1` as the 12-hour formatted hour, `m1` as the minute part, and `time` as either 'AM' or 'PM'.**
