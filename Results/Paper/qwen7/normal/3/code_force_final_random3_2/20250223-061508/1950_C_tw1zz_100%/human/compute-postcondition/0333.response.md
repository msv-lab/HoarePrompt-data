Output State: **`h1` is '06', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `time` is 'PM'**

Explanation: The variable `time` is assigned the value `'PM'`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, and the original `time` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, they remain as they were in the initial state.
