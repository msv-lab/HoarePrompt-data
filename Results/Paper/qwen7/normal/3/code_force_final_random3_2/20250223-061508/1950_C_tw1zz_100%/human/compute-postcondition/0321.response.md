Output State: **`h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `time` is 'PM'**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, and the content of `time` are updated accordingly. The initial values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged, and `h` remains a string containing the hour part of the input. The value of `time` is now explicitly set to `'PM'`.
