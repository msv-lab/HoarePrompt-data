Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input**.

The code splits the input string using `':'` as the delimiter and converts both parts to strings. The original condition that the input value must be a positive integer is no longer directly applicable since the input is now split into two string parts (`h` and `m`).
