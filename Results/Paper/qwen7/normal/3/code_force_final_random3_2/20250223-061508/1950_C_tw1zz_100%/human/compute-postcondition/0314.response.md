Output State: **`h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `time` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'09'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables (`m1`, `h`, and `time`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
