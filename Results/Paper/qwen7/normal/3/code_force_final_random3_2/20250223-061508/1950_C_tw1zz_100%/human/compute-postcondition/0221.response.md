Output State: **`h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'01'` to the variable `h1`. The other variables (`m1`, `h`, `m`, and `time`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
