Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the integer input provided by the user. After all iterations, the output state will be as follows:

- `h1` will be the 12-hour format representation of the hour part of the last input time, with 'AM' or 'PM' appended based on whether the hour is before or after noon.
- `m1` will be equal to the minute part of the last input time.
- `time` will be 'AM' if the hour part of the last input time is '01', '02', '03', or '04', and 'PM' otherwise.

In summary, the final output will reflect the 12-hour format of the last processed time along with its minutes and AM/PM indicator.
