Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, `h` is not equal to '02', and the current value of `h` is '03'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'03'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables (`m1`, `time`, `h`) retain their previous values as per the initial state.
