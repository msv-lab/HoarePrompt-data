To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - The conditions for `h1` and `time` are specified:
     - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```
   This statement prints `h1`, followed by a colon (`:`), then `m`, followed by a space, and finally `time`, with no spaces between the arguments due to the `sep=''` parameter.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since the exact value of `h` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider the possible values for `h` and their corresponding `h1` and `time`:
     - If `h` is any value from '01' to '12', `h1` will be the same as `h` and `time` will be 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '13', `h1` will be '01' and `time` will be 'PM'.
   - `m` is not explicitly defined, but it is mentioned that `m1` is equal to `m`, so `m` can be any valid minute value (e.g., '00', '01', ..., '59').

4. **Final Output:**
   - Given the conditions, the most general form of the output would be:
     - `h1` is the 12-hour format of `h`.
     - `m` is the minute value.
     - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the value of `h`.

Therefore, the output will be in the format of `h1 : m time`, where `h1` is the 12-hour format of `h`, `m` is the minute value, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **h1 : m AM/PM**
