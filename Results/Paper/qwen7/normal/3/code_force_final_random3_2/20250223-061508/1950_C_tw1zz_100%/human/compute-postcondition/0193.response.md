Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- The conditions for `h1` and `time` based on `h` are as follows:
  - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is used, which means it is not being used in the loop body and does not affect the state.
- The loop will run for a number of times specified by the user input.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
Since the loop does not depend on the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `time` to determine whether it should continue, these values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final State
The state remains the same as the initial state because the loop head does not modify these variables.

### Answer
State: **`h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'.**
