Output State: **`h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'PM'**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected. The initial values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and the updated values of `h` and `m` (which are the input values split by `:`) remain unchanged.
