Functionality: **The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and prints 'Yes' if \( (n - m) \) is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the condition.**
