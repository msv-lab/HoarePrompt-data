Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The current value of `n - m` is even and non-negative.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since no specific values for `n` and `m` are provided other than the conditions they must satisfy, the `print` statement does not depend on these variables.

Output: **Yes**
