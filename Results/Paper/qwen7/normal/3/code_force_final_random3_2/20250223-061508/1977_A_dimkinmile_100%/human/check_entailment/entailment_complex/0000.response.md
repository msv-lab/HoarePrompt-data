Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, which is correctly handled within the loop that iterates `t` times.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers, `n` and `m`, and checks if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
3. The logic in `func_1()` correctly determines whether it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves by checking if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. This logic is sound because:
   - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that the difference between the number of additions and removals of cubes results in exactly `m` cubes, which is possible given the rules of the problem.
   - If the condition is not met, it means that achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves is not possible under the given rules.
4. The program outputs "Yes" or "No" based on the condition, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
