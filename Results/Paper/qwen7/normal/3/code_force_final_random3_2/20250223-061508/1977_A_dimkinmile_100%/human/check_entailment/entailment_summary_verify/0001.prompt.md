You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and prints 'Yes' if \( (n - m) \) is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the condition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This is problematic because the function is called inside the loop without any implementation.

3. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.

4. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic to check if it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, which means the operations can balance out to achieve `m` cubes.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on the logic check, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error due to the unimplemented function `func_1()`. However, if we assume the intention was to call `func_1()` within the loop to process each test case, the core logic for determining whether it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct.

Given the context and assuming the intention was to call `func_1()` instead of leaving it undefined, the program should be modified to:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Since the core logic is correct and the function should be called to process each test case, the correctness of the program is contingent on this assumption.

Correctness: **False** (due to the unimplemented function `func_1()`)

If the function `func_1()` is implemented as intended, the correctness would be **True**.
