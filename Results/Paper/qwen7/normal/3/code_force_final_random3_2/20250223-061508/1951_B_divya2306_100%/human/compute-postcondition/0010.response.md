Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `wins` is increased by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`wins` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
