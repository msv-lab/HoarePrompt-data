Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `wins` is 4, `i` is 9999, `n` is 10000, and `t`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values or states as they were not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `wins` is 5, `i` is less than `k - 1`, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[k - 1]`, no change occurs to `i` or the break condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `wins` is 6, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then `i` is less than or equal to `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[k - 1]`, the same conditions apply as the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `wins` is 7, `i` is 7




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
