Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not used in the code. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not used in the code. The new variable `a` is created and assigned a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`.
