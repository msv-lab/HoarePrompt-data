Output State: **`wins` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `wins` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `wins` to 0.
