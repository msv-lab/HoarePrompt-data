Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `win_with_swap` (which is used in the range function) and `k - 1` (the upper bound of the range).

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 9999.
   - `win_with_swap` is part of the range function but its value is not explicitly given. We need to consider how it affects the loop.
   - `k - 1` is the upper bound of the range, and `k` is not directly given, but we know that the loop will run until `i` is less than `k - 1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `k - 1` for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is currently 9999. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `k - 1`.
   - `win_with_swap` is not explicitly mentioned, but since it is part of the range function, we need to ensure that the range is valid. However, the exact value of `win_with_swap` is not critical for determining the loop's execution as long as it is within the valid range of integers.
   - `k - 1` should be greater than 9999 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs adjustment is `i` being less than `k - 1`.

**State:**
- `wins` is 4
- `i` must be less than `k - 1`
- `n` is 10000 (though it doesn't affect the loop directly, it provides context)

Since `n` is not directly involved in the loop condition, we don't need to adjust it specifically for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`wins` is 4, `i` must be less than `k - 1`, `n` is 10000**
