Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `wins` is 10000.
   - `i` is 9999.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
   ```

3. **Understanding the Expression**:
   - `wins` is explicitly given as 10000.
   - `win_with_swap` is not explicitly given, but it is irrelevant for the calculation since it does not appear in the expression directly.
   - The expression inside the `max` function is `max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0))`.

4. **Evaluating the Expression**:
   - `wins - 1` evaluates to `10000 - 1 = 9999`.
   - `(wins != 0)` evaluates to `True` because `wins` is 10000, which is not zero. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1`.
   - So, `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` simplifies to `win_with_swap - 10000 - 1 + 1 = win_with_swap - 10000`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since `win_with_swap` is not specified, let's assume it doesn't affect the result because the expression `win_with_swap - 10000` would just be some number subtracted from 10000. The important part is comparing `9999` and `win_with_swap - 10000`.
   - Regardless of the value of `win_with_swap`, the term `win_with_swap - 10000` will always be less than or equal to 9999 (since `win_with_swap` is some value, and even if it were 10000, it would still be 0).

Therefore, the `max` function will return `9999`.

Output: **9999**
