Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`**

Explanation: The code initializes `lsum` by adding the first two elements of the list `S[i]` where `i` is 0. So, `lsum` becomes the sum of `S[0][0]` and `S[0][1]`. The values of `i` and `left` remain unchanged from their initial states.
