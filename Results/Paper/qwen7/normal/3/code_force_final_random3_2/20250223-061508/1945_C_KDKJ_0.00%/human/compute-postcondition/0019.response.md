Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `s` is the current character being processed in the string `a`.
   - `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S[0]` plus 1 if `s` is '0', or equal to the last element of the list `S[0]` if `s` is '1'.
   - `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S[1]` if `s` is '0', or equal to the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1 if `s` is '1'.
   - `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `s` in the string `a`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `s`, `x`, `y`, and `S`.
   - After processing each character `s` in the string `a`, the value of `s` changes to the next character in the string.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the current value of `s`.
   - The list `S` is updated to include the new values of `x` and `y`.

4. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - Since `a` is a non-empty string, after processing the first character, the remaining string `a` will be one character shorter.
   - The variable `s` will be set to the next character in the string `a`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the current value of `s`.
   - The list `S` will be updated to include the new values of `x` and `y`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `a` will be one character shorter than its initial length.
   - `s` will be the next character in the string `a`.
   - `x` and `y` will be updated based on the current value of `s`.
   - `S` will be updated to include the new values of `x` and `y`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the current character in the string `a`; if `s` is '0', then `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S[0]` plus 1 and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S[1]`; otherwise, `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S[0]` and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`**.
