Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; if `s` is '0', then `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0] plus 1 and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1]; otherwise, `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0] and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1] plus 1.
