Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]) - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1])`, `ans` is 2, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`**.

Explanation: If the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` is true, then `ans` is set to 2. Since there is no else part, the values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `right` remain unchanged. If the condition is false, `ans` remains as its original value, which is either 0 or 1, and the other variables also remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state of the variables is determined by the condition and the initial values provided.
