Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for laying the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums for both zeros and ones up to each house. This allows it to quickly determine the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides for any given position `i`.

2. **Satisfaction Check**: For each possible position `i`, it checks if the number of satisfied residents on both sides meets the requirement (`left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`). 

3. **Optimal Position Selection**: It selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the center of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i)`). If multiple positions have the same minimum distance, it chooses the smaller one.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program handles all described cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
