You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called three times.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, `func_1()` has been called three times as specified by the loop condition. The state of these variables does not change during the loop's execution; they retain their initial conditions except for the number of times `func_1()` has been called, which is now three.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the binary string 'a' of length n, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, consisting only of '0' and '1'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
