### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of houses) and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1').
   - It processes the string `a` to count the occurrences of '0' and '1' and stores these counts in a list `S`.
   - The list `S` is constructed such that `S[i]` contains the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th position in the string `a`.
   - The function then iterates through the list `S` to find the optimal index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while ensuring a balanced distribution of '0's and '1's on either side of `i`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` (number of test cases) from standard input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` three times.
   - The function does not modify the values of `n` and `a` beyond reading them once per test case and calling `func_1` three times.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the optimal index `i` such that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
   - The solution involves counting the number of '0's and '1's up to each position and checking the balance condition.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the string `a` and calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It then iterates through these counts to find the optimal index `i` that satisfies the balance condition and minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` three times for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
