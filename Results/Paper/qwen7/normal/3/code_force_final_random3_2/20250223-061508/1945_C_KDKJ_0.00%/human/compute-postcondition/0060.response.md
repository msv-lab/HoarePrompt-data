The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, `ans`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]) - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1])`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`.**
