Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function processes the string `a` to count the occurrences of '0' and '1' and stores these counts in a list `S`. After processing, it determines the optimal index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while ensuring a balanced distribution of '0's and '1's on either side of `i`. Finally, it prints the index `i` that satisfies these conditions.**
