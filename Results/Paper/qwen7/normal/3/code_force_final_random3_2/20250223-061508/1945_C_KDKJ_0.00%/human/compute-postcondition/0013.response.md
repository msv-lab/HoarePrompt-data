Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0], `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1]**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `S` to `x` and the second last element of the list `S` to `y`. Since `S` contains either `[x+1, y]` or `[x, y+1]`, the values of `x` and `y` are now updated to the last elements of `S`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
