Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
