Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is greater than 0, `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code reassigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` to new values entered by the user. It also calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. Additionally, it calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`. The values of `t` and `B` remain unchanged from their previous definitions.
