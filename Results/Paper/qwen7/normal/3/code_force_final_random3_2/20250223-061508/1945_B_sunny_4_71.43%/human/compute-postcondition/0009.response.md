Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `A` is the value of `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `B` is updated to the value of `int(m / b) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `B` to `int(m / b) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the integers entered by the user, and `A` remains as `int(m / a) + 1`. The variable `t` is decremented by 1, but since the initial state did not specify the value of `t`, we only note that `t` is now `t - 1`.
