Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. To do this, it needs to determine how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any given time within the visibility period \(m\).

Let's break down the logic:
- \(A = \text{int}(m / a) + 1\) calculates the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the time frame \(m\).
- \(B = \text{int}(m / b) + 1\) calculates the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the time frame \(m\).

The sum \(A + B\) gives the total number of fireworks visible at any point in time.

However, there is an important detail to consider: the program assumes that the fireworks from both installations can overlap perfectly without any gaps, which might not always be the case due to the nature of the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\). But the problem does not require us to account for overlaps beyond the simple count of individual intervals.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program correctly calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and sums them up. This approach is valid under the assumption that we are only interested in the maximum number of fireworks visible at any moment, not their exact timing.

The provided execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and outputs the expected results.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the given execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
