Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
- The solution calculates \(A\) and \(B\) as the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installation within the visibility period \(m\), respectively.
- \(A\) is calculated as \(\text{int}(m / a) + 1\) which gives the number of intervals of length \(a\) that fit into \(m\), plus one additional interval.
- Similarly, \(B\) is calculated as \(\text{int}(m / b) + 1\).
- The sum \(A + B\) represents the total number of fireworks visible at any given moment since they are launched at different intervals.
- The logic correctly accounts for the fact that fireworks from both installations can overlap in their visibility periods, but the calculation ensures that the maximum number of simultaneous visible fireworks is captured.
- The program processes each test case correctly and prints the result for each case, ensuring that the final output is the sum of \(A\) and \(B\) for the last test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
