Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
2. The given solution calculates \(A\) and \(B\), which represent the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installation within \(m\) minutes, respectively.
3. \(A\) is calculated as \(\text{int}(m / a) + 1\), which represents the number of multiples of \(a\) up to \(m\).
4. Similarly, \(B\) is calculated as \(\text{int}(m / b) + 1\), representing the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(m\).
5. The sum \(A + B\) gives the total number of fireworks visible simultaneously, considering they might overlap.
6. However, the logic assumes that there is no overlap between the fireworks from the two installations, which is incorrect because fireworks launched at the same time from different installations should not be counted twice.
7. To correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which would give us the periodicity of when both installations launch fireworks at the same time.
8. The current solution does not account for this overlap and simply adds the counts of individual installations, leading to an overestimation.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched simultaneously from both installations.

Correctness: **False**
