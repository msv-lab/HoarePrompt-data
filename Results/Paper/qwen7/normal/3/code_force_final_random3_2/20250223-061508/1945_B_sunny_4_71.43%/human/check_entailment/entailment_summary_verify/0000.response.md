### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes up to 10,000 test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates two values \(A\) and \(B\) as \(A = \text{int}(m / a) + 1\) and \(B = \text{int}(m / b) + 1\).
- It then prints the sum \(A + B\).

#### Analysis:
1. **Calculation of \(A\) and \(B\):**
   - \(A = \text{int}(m / a) + 1\) represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period \(m\).
   - \(B = \text{int}(m / b) + 1\) represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period \(m\).

2. **Sum \(A + B\):**
   - The program simply adds these two values and prints the result. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

3. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the overlap of the launch times from both installations.
   - The key insight is that the overlap occurs at multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to calculate the number of unique launch times from both installations within the visibility period \(m\).
   - The number of unique launch times from the first installation is \( \text{int}(m / a) + 1 \).
   - The number of unique launch times from the second installation is \( \text{int}(m / b) + 1 \).
   - The number of overlaps (common launch times) is \( \text{int}(m / \text{lcm}(a, b)) \).

5. **Formula for Maximum Fireworks Visible:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is given by:
     \[
     \text{max\_visible} = A + B - \text{int}(m / \text{lcm}(a, b))
     \]

#### Example Calculation:
- For the input `(a=6, b=7, m=4)`:
  - \(A = \text{int}(4 / 6) + 1 = 1\)
  - \(B = \text{int}(4 / 7) + 1 = 1\)
  - LCM of 6 and 7 is 42, so \(\text{int}(4 / 42) = 0\)
  - Maximum visible fireworks = \(1 + 1 - 0 = 2\)

The program provided in the original assessment does not correctly handle the overlap, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time due to the lack of overlap consideration.

**Final: False**
