You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles. It recursively determines whether the player who starts the game can guarantee a win based on the current configuration of stone piles. If the starting player can guarantee a win, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 2.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players take turns removing a positive integer `k` (where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile simultaneously.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **`func_1(a)`**: This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a`, calculates the difference between consecutive elements, and returns the modified list. However, this function does not seem to be directly related to solving the game logic.
   - **`func_2(a, n)`**: This function is intended to determine the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`a`). It uses recursion to determine the winner.

3. **Game Theory Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.

4. **Checking the Function Implementation:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - For `n == 1`, the function returns 1 (Alice wins).
     - For `n == 2`, it checks if the first pile size is even. If even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - It recursively calls itself with the remaining piles and checks if the opponent can force a win.
     - If the opponent can force a win or if the first pile size is not 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The base cases handle small scenarios correctly.
   - The recursive case seems to follow the logic of determining the winner based on the optimal moves.
   - However, the function does not use the Nim-sum approach, which is a more efficient and correct way to solve this type of game.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the game logic based on the Nim-sum approach. Therefore, the function may produce incorrect results for certain test cases.
