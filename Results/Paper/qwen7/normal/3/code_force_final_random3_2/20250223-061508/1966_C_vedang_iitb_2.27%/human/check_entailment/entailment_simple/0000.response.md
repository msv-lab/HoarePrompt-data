Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. Both players play optimally, removing a positive integer \(k\) (at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile simultaneously. The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**: The solution to this problem lies in the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, the player whose turn it is will win.

3. **Analyzed Code**:
   - **func_1**: This function sorts the unique values in the list `a` and performs a transformation on these values. However, the transformation itself does not align with the Nim-sum strategy. It seems to be an unnecessary step and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.
   - **func_2**: This function attempts to solve the problem using a recursive approach to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum concept. However, it incorrectly handles the base cases and recursive logic. Specifically:
     - For \(n = 1\), it should always return 1 (Alice wins).
     - For \(n = 2\), it should check if the first pile is even; if so, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
     - For \(n > 2\), it should use the recursive logic correctly to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum of the remaining piles.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player loses.
   - Otherwise, the current player wins.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the Nim-sum strategy and contains logical errors in the recursive function. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
