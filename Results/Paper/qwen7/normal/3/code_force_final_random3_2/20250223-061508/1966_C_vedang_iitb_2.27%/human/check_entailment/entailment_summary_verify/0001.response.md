### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones.
   - Players take turns removing a positive integer `k` (where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile simultaneously.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **`func_1(a)`**: This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a`, calculates the difference between consecutive elements, and returns the modified list. However, this function does not seem to be directly related to solving the game logic.
   - **`func_2(a, n)`**: This function is intended to determine the winner based on the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`a`). It uses recursion to determine the winner.

3. **Game Theory Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.

4. **Checking the Function Implementation:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - For `n == 1`, the function returns 1 (Alice wins).
     - For `n == 2`, it checks if the first pile size is even. If even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - It recursively calls itself with the remaining piles and checks if the opponent can force a win.
     - If the opponent can force a win or if the first pile size is not 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The base cases handle small scenarios correctly.
   - The recursive case seems to follow the logic of determining the winner based on the optimal moves.
   - However, the function does not use the Nim-sum approach, which is a more efficient and correct way to solve this type of game.

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that `func_2` determines the winner based on the current configuration of stone piles. Given the recursive nature and the base cases, it appears to correctly implement the game logic for small cases but does not explicitly use the Nim-sum approach.

7. **Test Cases Evaluation:**
   - The provided test cases show that the function produces the correct results for the given examples. This suggests that the function is likely correct for the specific cases tested.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_2` correctly implements the game logic for the given test cases. While it does not explicitly use the Nim-sum approach, it correctly determines the winner based on the optimal moves for the given configurations.

**Correctness: **True**

### Final:
Final: **True**
