Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to win.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: This function processes the input list `a` by sorting it, removing duplicates, and then updating the list such that each element `a_new[i]` is the difference between the current element and the sum of all previous elements. This transformation is crucial for simplifying the game state.
   - **func_2**: This recursive function determines the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`. It uses a recursive strategy to determine if the starting player can force a win.

3. **Analysis of func_1**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly transforms the input list `a` into a new list `a_new` where each element represents the unique, cumulative difference of stones in the piles. This transformation helps in simplifying the game state for the recursive function `func_2`.

4. **Analysis of func_2**:
   - The base cases handle scenarios with 1 or 2 piles directly.
   - For more than 2 piles, the function checks if the next player (`winNext`) can be forced into a losing position. If the current player can force the next player into a losing position or if the next player cannot force a win and the current pile size is not 1, the current player wins.

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the input, processes it using `func_1`, and then uses `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the game's rules and ensures that the optimal moves are considered.

Given the detailed analysis, the transformations and recursive logic in the provided functions correctly implement the game's rules and determine the winner based on the optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
