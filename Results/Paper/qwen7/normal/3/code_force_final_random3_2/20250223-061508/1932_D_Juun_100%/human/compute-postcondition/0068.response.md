Postcondition: `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last element, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`. If `trumps` is not empty, `trumps` will have been modified to exclude the last element and `answers` will contain one additional valid answer. If `trumps` is empty, the function returns `None`.
