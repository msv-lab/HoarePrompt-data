#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings where the first character is the rank of the card ("23456789") and the second character is the suit of the card ("CDHS"). All cards are unique within each test case.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: All cards have been processed, `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue

            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list since it has been emptied after all its elements were popped in each iteration, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with each element being a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are `None` since all ranks have been processed and there are no more valid answers to generate.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, processing all ranks for each suit and generating the required answers. The `trumps` list is now empty because all its elements have been popped out. The `suits` dictionary reflects that all ranks have been processed, with all values set to `None`.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to run as long as `trumps` is not empty. Since the loop removes two elements from `trumps` in each iteration (with `trumps.pop()` called twice), eventually `trumps` will become empty, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, there are no more elements left to pop from `trumps`, so it remains empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `answers` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of card descriptions based on a specified trump suit. It identifies cards matching the trump suit, generates valid answers by comparing ranks of non-trump cards, and prints these answers. Finally, it prints pairs of remaining trump cards in descending order of their ranks. The function does not return any value.
