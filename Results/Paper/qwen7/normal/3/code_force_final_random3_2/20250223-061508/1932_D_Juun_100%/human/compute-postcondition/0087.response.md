Output State: **`answers` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: Given that the loop continues to run as long as `answers` is not empty and it removes one element from `answers` in each iteration (since `print(answer)` consumes one element from `answers`), the loop will continue to execute until `answers` becomes empty. Once `answers` is empty, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `answers` will be an empty list.
