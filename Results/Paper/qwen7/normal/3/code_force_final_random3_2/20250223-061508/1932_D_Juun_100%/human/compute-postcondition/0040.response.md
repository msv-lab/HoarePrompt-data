Output State: **All cards have been processed, `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `trumps` will contain all ranks of cards whose suit matches the specified trump suit.
- The variable `answers` will contain all valid answers generated during the loop execution, where each answer is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`).
- The variable `suits` will be a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`, indicating that no suits have any ranks assigned after processing all cards.
