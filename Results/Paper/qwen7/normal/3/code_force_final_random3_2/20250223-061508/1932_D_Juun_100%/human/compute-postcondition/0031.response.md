Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing one or two elements where the second element is `rank` if the suit matches the trump suit, otherwise it is a list containing only `rank`, `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None` except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank` if `suits[suit]` is not `None` or to `None` if `suits[suit]` is `None`, `rank` is the rank of the current card, `suit` is the suit of the current card.**
