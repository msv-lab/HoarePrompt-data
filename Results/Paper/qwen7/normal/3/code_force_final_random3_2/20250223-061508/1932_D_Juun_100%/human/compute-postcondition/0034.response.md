Output State: **`rank` is the rank of the next card, `suit` is the suit of the next card, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing the second element as `rank` (previously it was one or two elements where the second element was `rank` if the suit matched the trump suit), `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None` except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank` if `suits[suit]` is not `None` or to `None` if `suits[suit]` is `None`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. Since `trumps` originally had one or two elements, and the second element was `rank` if the suit matched the trump suit, appending `rank` again changes its structure to just contain `rank`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
