Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string which is the input from the user, `trumps` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `trumps`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the trump suit remains as an unassigned user input string.
