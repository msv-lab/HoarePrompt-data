Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string which is the input from the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing one element which is `rank` if the suit matches the trump suit, otherwise it is an empty list. `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None` except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank` (if `suits[suit]` is not `None`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing one or two elements where the second element is `rank` if the suit matches the trump suit, otherwise it is a list containing only `rank`, `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None` except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank` if `suits[suit]` is not `None` or to `None` if `suits[suit]` is `None`, `rank` is the rank of the current card, `suit` is the suit of the current card.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rank` is the rank of the next card, `suit` is the suit of the next card, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing one or two elements where the second element is `rank` if the suit matches the trump suit, otherwise it is a list containing only `rank`, `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None` except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank` if `suits[suit]` is not `None` or to `None` if `suits[suit]` is `None`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
