Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card, `suits[suit]` is not `None`, and `suit` is not equal to `trump suit`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `answers` list a string created by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space. Since `suits[suit]` is not `None` and `suit` is not equal to `trump suit`, these values are used in the operation. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
