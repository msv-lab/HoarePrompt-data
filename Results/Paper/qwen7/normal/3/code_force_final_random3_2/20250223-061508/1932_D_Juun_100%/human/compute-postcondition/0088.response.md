Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a set of card descriptions and does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code. If the function reaches a point where it needs to return, it returns None.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters and does not return anything under normal circumstances. It processes some input data (card descriptions) internally but does not provide any output through a return statement. If there is a need to indicate the end of execution or an absence of result, it returns `None`.
