Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to run as long as `trumps` is not empty. Each iteration of the loop removes two elements from `trumps` using `pop()`, which means that once all elements are removed, `trumps` becomes empty, causing the loop to terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list.
