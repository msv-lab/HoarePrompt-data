The only variable in the loop head is the variable `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` is not an empty list. For the loop to be executed one more time, `trumps` must still not be an empty list.

State: **`trumps` is not an empty list**
