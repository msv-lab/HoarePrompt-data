Functionality: **The function processes a set of card descriptions based on a specified trump suit. It identifies cards matching the trump suit, generates valid answers by comparing ranks of non-trump cards, and prints these answers. Finally, it prints pairs of remaining trump cards in descending order of their ranks. The function does not return any value.**
