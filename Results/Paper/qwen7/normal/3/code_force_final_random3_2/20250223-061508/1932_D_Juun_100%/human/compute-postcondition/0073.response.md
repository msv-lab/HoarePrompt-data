Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `trumps != []`. This means the loop will execute as long as the list `trumps` is not empty.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `trumps` is an empty list.
   - `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution.
   - `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are `None`.
   - `trumps` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute the first time, `trumps` must not be empty. Since `trumps` is currently an empty list, we need to change this state so that `trumps` is not empty.

4. **Adjusting the State**: We need to ensure that `trumps` is not empty at the start of the loop. This can be achieved by adding at least one element to the list `trumps`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `trumps` should not be an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`trumps` is not an empty list**
