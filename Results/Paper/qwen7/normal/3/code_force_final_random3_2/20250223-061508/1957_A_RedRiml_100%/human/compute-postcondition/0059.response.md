Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with key `i` is now `1`, and the value associated with other keys remains `None`.**

The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The list `palka` and the other values in the dictionary `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.
