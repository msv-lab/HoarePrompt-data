The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `palka`.

At the end of the last iteration, `palka` is a list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. The loop increments the count of `i` in the dictionary `d` if `i` is already present, or sets `d[i]` to 1 if `i` is not present.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `palka`.
2. The variable `i` will take the next element from the list `palka`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can only say that `i` will be the next element in the list `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `palka` remains the same list of integers.
- `i` will be the next element in the list `palka`.

State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`**
