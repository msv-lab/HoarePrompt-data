Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for each `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

This means that `shapes` is calculated by iterating over each `j` in `pl` and adding `d[j] // 3` to `shapes` only if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. Since the actual values of `d` and `pl` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`.

However, the print statement simply outputs the value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for each `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3)**
