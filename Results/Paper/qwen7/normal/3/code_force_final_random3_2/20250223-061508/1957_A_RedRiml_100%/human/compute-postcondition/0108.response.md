Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of the list `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `palka`, the first value of `i` will be the first element of `palka`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `palka`**: The list `palka` is obtained from splitting an input and converting each element to an integer. Therefore, `palka` must contain at least one integer.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be the first element of `palka`.
- `palka` must contain at least one integer.

Therefore, the state after adjustment would be:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `palka`, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `shapes` is 6, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary**.
