Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `d` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.**

This means that the dictionary `d` will have every unique integer from the list `palka` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The list `pl` will be a sorted version of the unique elements from `palka`, preserving the order in which they first appeared.
