State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(w):`, which means the loop will run `w` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `w` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), because `range(w)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `w-1`.
3. The variable `t` is not used within the loop condition or directly controlling the loop's execution, so its current state (being an integer between 1 and 100) does not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `t`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring `w` is greater than 0.
