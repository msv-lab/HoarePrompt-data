Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `d` is a dictionary.
- The postcondition states that if `i` is not in the list `palka`, then `i` is added as a key in the dictionary and its value is set to 1. If `i` is already in the dictionary, its value is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`.
- The loop body (which is omitted) updates the dictionary `d` based on the value of `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `palka`.
2. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `palka`, the variable `i` will change with each iteration.
   - The dictionary `d` will be updated based on the value of `i`.

### Possible Scenarios
- If `i` was not in `palka` during the previous iteration, it might have been added to the dictionary `d` with a value of 1.
- If `i` was already in `d`, its value would have been incremented by 1.

### Updated State
Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `i` will be the next element in `palka` for the next iteration. Therefore, the state of `d` will depend on the value of `i` in the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`d` is a dictionary, and `i` is the next element in the list `palka`**.

This means that `i` will be the next element in `palka` for the next iteration, and `d` will be updated accordingly based on the value of `i`.
