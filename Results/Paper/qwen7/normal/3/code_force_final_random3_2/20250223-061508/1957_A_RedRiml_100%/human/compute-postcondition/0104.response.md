Output State: **`shapes` is 6, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer.**

The code `ln = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `ln`. The initial values of `shapes` and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, `shapes` is still 6 and `w` must still be greater than 0. The value of `ln` is the integer input from the user.
