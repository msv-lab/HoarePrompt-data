Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in pl:`. This means the loop variable is `j`, and it iterates over the elements in the list `pl`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will continue if there are more elements in `pl` to iterate over.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (assuming `pl` contains at least two elements).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 2.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that the current value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - After incrementing `j` to 2, we need to ensure that `d[2]` is greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the next iteration requires `d[2]` to be greater than or equal to 3.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`shapes` is 1, `j` is 2, and the current value of `d[2]` is greater than or equal to 3**.
