Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 6, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element of `palka`, `palka` is a list of integers, `shapes` is 6, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing `i`, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of `i` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka` appended once, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the second element of `palka` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` twice, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the third element of `palka` is set to 1 if it was initially `None`, or incremented by 1 if it was not `None`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
