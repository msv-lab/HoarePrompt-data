Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `i` is the second element of `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka` appended once.
   - `d` is a dictionary where the value of the second element of `palka` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `palka` after the current element `i` has been processed.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `palka`, the next element in `palka` will be the third element.
   - `pl` will now contain the third element of `palka` appended once.
   - `d` will be updated based on the third element of `palka`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be the third element of `palka`.
- `pl` will be a list containing the third element of `palka` appended once.
- `d` will be updated based on the third element of `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` appended once, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the third element of `palka` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.**
