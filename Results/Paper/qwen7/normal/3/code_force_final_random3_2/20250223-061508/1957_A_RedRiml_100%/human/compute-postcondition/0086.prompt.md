Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `w` is decremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `d`, then the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with one additional element which is `i`, and `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its current value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with one additional element `i`, and `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its current value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
