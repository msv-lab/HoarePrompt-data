Output State: `minn` is either `maxx` + 1, `maxx` + 2, ..., up to `maxx + n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or an additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` for each iteration, and `maxx` is the maximum value between `maxx` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `minn` will be at least `maxx + 1` and can be as high as `maxx + n`.
- `t`, `n`, and `arr` will retain their initial values.
- `mex` will contain all the values calculated during the loop, including the absolute differences and the values of `minn` appended when `arr[i] > 0`.
- `maxx` will be the highest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
