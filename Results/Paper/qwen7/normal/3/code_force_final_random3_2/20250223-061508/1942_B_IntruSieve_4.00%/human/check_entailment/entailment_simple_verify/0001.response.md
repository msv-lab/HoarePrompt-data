### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.

3. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the program checks if the value is positive.
     - If positive, it appends the current `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it resets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
   - If the value is negative, it calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if necessary.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex`.

#### Problem-Specific Analysis

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of an array is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
  - The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

- **Handling Positive Values**:
  - When `arr[i]` is positive, the program correctly sets `mex[i]` to `minn` and increments `minn`.
  - This ensures that the smallest missing integer is added to the permutation, which is consistent with the definition of MEX.

- **Handling Negative Values**:
  - When `arr[i]` is negative, the program calculates the MEX as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`.
  - This step ensures that the permutation is constructed correctly to match the given `a` array.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `minn` equals `maxx` by resetting `minn` to `maxx + 1`, ensuring that the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

- **Initial State**:
  - `t` is read and represents the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` is read and represents the size of the permutation and array `a`.

- **Function `func_1()`**:
  - `n` is read and represents the size of the permutation and array `a`.
  - `arr` is read and converted to a list of integers.
  - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
  - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0.
  - A loop iterates over the elements of `arr`:
    - If `arr[i]` is positive, `minn` is appended to `mex` and `minn` is incremented.
    - If `minn` equals `maxx`, `minn` is reset to `maxx + 1`.
    - If `arr[i]` is negative, the MEX value is calculated as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appended to `mex`. `maxx` is updated if necessary.
  - The elements of `mex` are printed.

- **Output State**:
  - After processing all elements, the program prints the elements of `mex`.

#### Correctness of the Program

- The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and follows the logic of the MEX function.
- The handling of positive and negative values in `arr` is correct.
- The edge case where `minn` equals `maxx` is handled correctly by resetting `minn`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and follows the logic of the MEX function. Therefore, the program is correct.
