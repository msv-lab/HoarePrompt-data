Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `itm` in `mex`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mex` must be a non-empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `mex` is not empty and there are elements to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must still be a non-empty list.
   - Since `itm` is just an element being iterated over, its specific value does not affect the loop condition directly.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `mex`, which must remain a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mex` must be a non-empty list**
