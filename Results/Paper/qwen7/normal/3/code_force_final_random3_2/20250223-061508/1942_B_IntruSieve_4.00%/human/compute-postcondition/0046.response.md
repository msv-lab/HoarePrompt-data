Output State: `minn` is either `maxx` + 1, `maxx` + 2, ..., up to the maximum possible value of `minn` which would be `n` (since `i` goes up to `n-1`), `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or an additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` for each iteration, and `maxx` is the maximum value between the original `maxx` and any `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered during the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `minn` will be the highest value it reached, which could be anywhere from `maxx + 1` to `n`, depending on the values in `arr`. The list `mex` will contain all the values calculated as the minimum non-negative integer not present in the set of adjusted `arr` values plus the original `minn` value added once. `maxx` will hold the largest value found among the differences between elements in `arr` and `minn`.
