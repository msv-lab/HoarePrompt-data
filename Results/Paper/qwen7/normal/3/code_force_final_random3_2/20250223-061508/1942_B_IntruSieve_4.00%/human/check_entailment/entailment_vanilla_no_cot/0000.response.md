Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX for each position in the array `arr` but does not correctly handle the logic for constructing the permutation `p`. Specifically, the logic inside `func_1` does not accurately reflect how the MEX value should be derived from the permutation `p`.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program tries to precompute the MEX values (`mex`) and then directly prints them. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting `p` will satisfy the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

3. **Missing Permutation Construction**: The program does not actually construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Instead, it seems to be trying to precompute MEX values which is not the right approach.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to construct the permutation `p` step-by-step while ensuring that the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\) holds true. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n  # Initialize the permutation with -1
    mex = 0  # Start with the smallest non-negative integer

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            # If arr[i] is non-negative, place mex at position i
            p[i] = mex
            mex += 1
        else:
            # If arr[i] is negative, find the position to place mex
            while mex in p[:i]:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            mex += 1

    # Print the constructed permutation
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly and satisfies the given conditions.
