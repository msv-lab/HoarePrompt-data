You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers stored in `mex` based on the input array and a variable `minn`. After processing all test cases, it prints the elements of `mex` for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed sequence of integers for each test case, while the input variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and constructing the permutation is flawed.

Let's analyze the program:

1. The program initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
2. It iterates through the array `arr` and tries to calculate the MEX value for each element.
3. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. However, this logic does not correctly compute the MEX value.
4. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to `mex`.

This approach does not correctly compute the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation, but the program incorrectly handles this calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0 1 0 1 2
```

This is incorrect because the MEX values do not match the expected values. For instance, after the first two elements `[0, 1]`, the MEX should be `2`, but the program incorrectly calculates it as `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly compute the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation and ensure that the resulting permutation satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
