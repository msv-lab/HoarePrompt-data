### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.

3. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the program checks if the value is positive.
     - If positive, it appends the current `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it resets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
   - If the value is negative, it calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if necessary.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Handling Positive Values
- When `arr[i]` is positive, the program correctly sets `mex[i]` to `minn` and increments `minn`.
- This ensures that the smallest missing integer is added to the permutation, which is consistent with the definition of MEX.

#### Handling Negative Values
- When `arr[i]` is negative, the program calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`.
- This step ensures that the permutation is constructed correctly to match the given `a` array.

#### Edge Cases
- The program handles the edge case where `minn` equals `maxx` by resetting `minn` to `maxx + 1`, ensuring that the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

### Correctness of the Program

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input as expected.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the MEX for each position in the array `a` and stores it in the list `mex`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs the permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
   - The logic for handling both positive and negative values in `a` is sound and ensures the correct construction of the permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex`, which represent the constructed permutation `p`.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and follows the logic of the MEX function. Therefore, the program is correct.
