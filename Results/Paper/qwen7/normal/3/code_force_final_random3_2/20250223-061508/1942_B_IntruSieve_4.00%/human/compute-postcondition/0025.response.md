Output State: **`minn` is `maxx` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, and `maxx` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This changes the value of `minn` to `maxx + 1`. All other variables remain in their initial states as no other operations are performed on them.
