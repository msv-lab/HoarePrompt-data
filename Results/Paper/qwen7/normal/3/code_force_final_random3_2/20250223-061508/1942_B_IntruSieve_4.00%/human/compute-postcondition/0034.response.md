Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or `maxx` + 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.
   - `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the loop, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
- `minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or `maxx` + 2.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.
- `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.

State: **`minn` is either `maxx` + 1 or `maxx` + 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or one additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**
