Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the logic used in the function `func()` aligns with the problem statement and the expected output.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched every \(a\) minutes.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched every \(b\) minutes.
- Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes after launch.
- The formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is derived from the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), but the given solution uses a different approach.

### Given Program Logic:
The program calculates the number of fireworks visible using the formula:
\[ \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \]

### Explanation of the Formula:
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the interval \([0, m]\).
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the interval \([0, m]\).
- Adding 2 accounts for the fact that the first and last fireworks launched might overlap in visibility, and the initial and final fireworks from each installation might also overlap.

### Verification:
Let's verify the given examples with the provided formula:
1. **Example 1**: \(a = 6\), \(b = 7\), \(m = 4\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{4}{6} \right\rfloor = 0\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{4}{7} \right\rfloor = 0\)
   - Result: \(0 + 0 + 2 = 2\)

2. **Example 2**: \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), \(m = 10\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{3} \right\rfloor = 3\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{4} \right\rfloor = 2\)
   - Result: \(3 + 2 + 2 = 7\)

3. **Example 3**: \(a = 7\), \(b = 8\), \(m = 56\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{56}{7} \right\rfloor = 8\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{56}{8} \right\rfloor = 7\)
   - Result: \(8 + 7 + 2 = 17\)

The formula matches the expected results for the given examples. Therefore, the logic in the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Correctness: **True**
