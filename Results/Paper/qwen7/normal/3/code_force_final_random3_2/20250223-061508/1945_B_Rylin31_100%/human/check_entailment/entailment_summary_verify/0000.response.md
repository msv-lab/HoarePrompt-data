### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched every \(a\) minutes.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched every \(b\) minutes.
- Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes after launch.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It prints the result of the expression \(m // a + m // b + 2\) for each test case.
- It does not return any value.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not account for simultaneous launches from both installations.

#### Analysis:
1. **Expression \(m // a + m // b + 2\)**:
   - \(m // a\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period \(m\).
   - \(m // b\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period \(m\).
   - Adding 2 accounts for the initial fireworks launched at \(t=0\).

2. **Simultaneous Launches**:
   - The key issue is that the program does not account for the possibility of simultaneous launches from both installations.
   - For example, if \(a = 6\) and \(b = 7\), and \(m = 4\):
     - The first installation launches at \(0, 6, 12, 18, \ldots\)
     - The second installation launches at \(0, 7, 14, 21, \ldots\)
     - Within \(m = 4\), the only simultaneous launch is at \(0\).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) gives the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - We then need to count how many such simultaneous launches fit within the visibility period \(m\).

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - For \(a = 6\), \(b = 7\), and \(m = 4\):
     - Simultaneous launches occur at \(0\) (LCM of 6 and 7 is 42, but within 4, only 0 is considered).
     - Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (initial launch + simultaneous launch).

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the scenario where fireworks from both installations overlap within the visibility period. The original assessment is accurate because the program does not account for simultaneous launches, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not properly account for simultaneous launches from both installations.
