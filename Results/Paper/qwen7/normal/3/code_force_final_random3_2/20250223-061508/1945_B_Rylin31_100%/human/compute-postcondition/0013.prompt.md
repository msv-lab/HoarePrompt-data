You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations the loop will run, `i` will be equal to `t`, `a` will be the last input integer received for the first iteration, `b` will be the last input integer received for the second iteration, and `m` will be the last input integer received for the third iteration. The loop will print the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the final value it was initialized to, `i` will be equal to `t`, and `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values of the last set of inputs provided for the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each of the `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}). It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
