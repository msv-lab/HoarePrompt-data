You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)), and prints the result of the expression \(m // a + m // b + 2\) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch. The key is to count how many fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time.

### Given Program Analysis
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It then calculates and prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Calculation Explanation
- `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the interval `[0, m]`.
- `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the interval `[0, m]`.
- The term `+ 2` accounts for the initial fireworks launched at time `0` from both installations, which are always visible together.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
  - Fireworks from the first installation: `[0, 6, 12]` (only `0` and `6` are within `[0, 4]`)
  - Fireworks from the second installation: `[0, 7]` (only `0` is within `[0, 4]`)
  - Total fireworks visible: `1 (from first) + 1 (from second) + 2 (initial ones) = 4 - 2 = 2`

- **Example 2**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
  - Fireworks from the first installation: `[0, 3, 6, 9]`
  - Fireworks from the second installation: `[0, 4, 8]`
  - Total fireworks visible: `4 (from first) + 3 (from second) + 2 (initial ones) = 9 - 1 = 7`

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not directly account for overlapping intervals correctly. Instead, we need to use the least common multiple (LCM) to find the intervals where both installations have fireworks visible simultaneously.

### Correct Solution
The correct approach involves using the LCM of `a` and `b` to find the intervals where both installations have fireworks visible simultaneously. However, the given solution does not correctly handle this.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the overlapping intervals properly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
