Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is correctly handled by the loop iterating `t` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the inputs are correctly parsed.

3. **Calculating Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \). This formula is derived from the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but it simplifies the calculation by leveraging the properties of floor division. Specifically, the term `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m` minutes, and similarly for `b`. Adding `2` accounts for the fact that fireworks from both installations can overlap in their visibility periods.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct. It handles the input, processes each test case correctly, and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
