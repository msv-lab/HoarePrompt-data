Postcondition: **`eli` is the index found by bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0)), `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. If `s` equals 1 or `e >= r`, then `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at index `LA`. Otherwise, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. `tc` is greater than 5.**
