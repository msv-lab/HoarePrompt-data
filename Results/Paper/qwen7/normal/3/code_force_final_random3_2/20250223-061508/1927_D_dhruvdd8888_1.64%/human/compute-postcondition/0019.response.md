Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `s` is either 0 or 2, `num` is equal to `nums[i]`, and `arr` contains tuples (2, 0, `nums[i]`) and (1, 1, `nums[i]`).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be equal to `nums[i]`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `num` now takes the value of `nums[1]` or `nums[2]`. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
