Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is the first element of the list `nums`.**

This means that the variable `num` is now assigned the value of the first element in the list `nums`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
