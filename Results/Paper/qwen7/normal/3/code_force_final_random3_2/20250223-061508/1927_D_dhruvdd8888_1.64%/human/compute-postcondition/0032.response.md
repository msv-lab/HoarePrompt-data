Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a placeholder indicating that the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only relevant variable here is the input value that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the input value. This means we need to adjust the state such that the input value is valid for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the given conditions**: The problem states that if `ppp` equals 23, no changes are made to the variables. However, since `ppp` is not mentioned in the loop head, this condition does not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

4. **Formulate the required state**: The loop will execute based on the input value provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is a valid integer that can be used to determine the number of iterations.

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value provided by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, and the input value must be a valid integer**
