Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`**.

In this output state, the variable `nums` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string using `input().split()` and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. All other variables retain their initial states.
