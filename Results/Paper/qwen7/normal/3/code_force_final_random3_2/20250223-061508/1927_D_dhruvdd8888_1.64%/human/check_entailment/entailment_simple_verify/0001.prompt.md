You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program processes the array `nums` to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - It appends tuples `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr` whenever a new segment of different elements starts.
   - The list `arr` stores the start index `s`, end index `e`, and the value `num` of each segment.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that lies within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position of the segment found, it determines whether there are two distinct elements within the query range.
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it prints the indices of the first and second element of the segment.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment ends at the boundary of the array, it checks if there are two distinct elements within the range and prints the appropriate indices or `-1 -1`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The logic for identifying segments where consecutive elements are the same seems correct. However, there is a small issue in the loop where `nums.append(-1)` is added. This should be done outside the loop to avoid appending `-1` multiple times.

2. **Binary Search Usage:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment is correct. However, the handling of the segment boundaries needs careful consideration to ensure all cases are covered.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The logic for handling queries is mostly correct but can be optimized. Specifically, the conditions for printing `-1 -1` and finding the correct indices can be simplified.

### Correctness Check

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle the problem correctly, although there are minor issues like the unnecessary `nums.append(-1)` inside the loop. However, these do not affect the overall correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies segments of the array and handles queries to find pairs of distinct elements within specified ranges. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
