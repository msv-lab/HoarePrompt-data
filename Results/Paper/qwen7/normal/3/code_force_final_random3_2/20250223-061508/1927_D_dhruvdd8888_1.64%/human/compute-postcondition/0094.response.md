Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `eli` is the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This means `eli` is the position in the sorted list `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is set to `N + 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are assigned the values from a tuple split by space and converted to integers. Let's denote these values as `l_val` and `r_val`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. Since `LA` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume it refers to `eli` for simplicity. So, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at index `eli` in `arr`.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

Given this breakdown, we need to determine the values of `s` and `e` when the print statement is executed.

- `s` and `e` are taken from the tuple at the index `eli` in the list `arr`.
- The tuple at `eli` in `arr` is assumed to be `(l_val, r_val, _)` based on the assignment from the tuple at `eli`.

Therefore, `s` and `e` are `l_val` and `r_val` respectively.

So, the print statement `print(s, e + 1)` will print `l_val` and `r_val + 1`.

Output: **l_val, r_val + 1**
