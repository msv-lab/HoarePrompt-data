Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`.**

The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline`) and assigns it to the variable `N`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
