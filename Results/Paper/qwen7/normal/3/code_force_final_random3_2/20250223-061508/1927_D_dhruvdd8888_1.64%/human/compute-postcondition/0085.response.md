Output State: **`eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple split by space and converted to integers, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `tc` is greater than 5, and the loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no further code in the current block after the `continue` statement, none of the variables are modified. The loop continues to its next iteration based on the loop control logic, which is not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop continues.
