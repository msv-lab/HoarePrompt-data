Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes each query to find pairs of indices `(i, j)` within the specified range `[l, r]` where `a_i â‰  a_j`.

2. **Identifying Transitions**:
   - The program identifies transitions in the array where the value changes and stores these transitions in the list `arr`.
   - This step ensures that for any subarray defined by a query, there will be at least one transition point where the value changes.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first transition point within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Depending on the position of the transition points relative to the query range, the program outputs the appropriate indices or `-1, -1` if no such pair exists.

4. **Edge Cases and Output**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the transition point is exactly at the start or end of the query range.
   - It correctly outputs `-1, -1` when no valid pair can be found within the query range.

Given the detailed annotations and the logic explained above, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
