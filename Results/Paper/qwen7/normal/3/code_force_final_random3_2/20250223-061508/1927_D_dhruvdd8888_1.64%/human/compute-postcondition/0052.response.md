Based on the initial state provided:

- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `N + 1`.
- `s` is `N`.
- `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
- `arr` contains tuples starting from \((2, 0, nums[0])\), followed by \((1, 1, nums[0])\), and ending with a tuple \((1 + s, N, nums[N])\).
- `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
- `s` is `N`.
- `e` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][1]`.
- `_` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][2]`.
- The value of `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
- The condition `(e >= r)` is true.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

The print statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`. These values are not dependent on any of the other variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **-1 -1**
