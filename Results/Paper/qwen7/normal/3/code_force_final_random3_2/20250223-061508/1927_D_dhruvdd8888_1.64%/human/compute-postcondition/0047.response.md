Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` contains tuples starting from `(2, 0, nums[0])`, followed by `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ending with a tuple `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`.
     - This means `arr` looks like this: `[(2, 0, nums[0]), (1, 1, nums[0]), ..., (1 + N, N, nums[N])]`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
     - Since `arr` starts from index 0 and ends at index `N`, `LA = N`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
     - We don't know the exact values of `l` and `r`, but they are integers.
   - `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
     - `bisect_left` returns the index where the value would be inserted to keep the list sorted. Given that `arr` is sorted, `eli` will be the smallest index such that `arr[eli][0] >= l`.
   - `s` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][0]`.
     - Since `LA = N`, `min(eli, LA) = eli`.
     - So, `s` is set to `arr[eli][0]`.
   - `e` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][1]`.
     - `e` is set to `arr[eli][1]`.
   - `_` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][2]`.
     - `_` is set to `arr[eli][2]`.

2. **Given Condition:**
   - The current value of `s` is less than or equal to 1.
     - From the initial state, `s = N`. Therefore, `N <= 1`.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print(s - 1, s)`.
     - Since `s = N` and `N <= 1`, the only possible value for `N` is 0 or 1.
     - If `N = 0`, then `s - 1 = -1` and `s = 0`.
     - If `N = 1`, then `s - 1 = 0` and `s = 1`.

Given the constraint that `s` is less than or equal to 1, the only valid values are `0` and `1`.

Output: **-1 0** if `N = 0`, or **0 1** if `N = 1**.
