Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `eli` is the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This means `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into `arr` to keep it sorted.
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple split by space and converted to integers. For example, if the input is "5 10", then `l = 5` and `r = 10`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. 
     - If `s` equals 1 or `e >= r`, then `s`, `e`, and `_` are reassigned from the tuple at index `LA`.
     - Otherwise, they remain as the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.
   - `_` is a valid integer input for the range function.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print(l, r)`.
   - Since `l` and `r` are assigned from the tuple split by space and converted to integers, their values depend on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the values of `l` and `r` are directly derived from the input provided. Since no specific input is given, let's assume an example input to illustrate the process. Suppose the input is "5 10".

- `l = 5`
- `r = 10`

Therefore, the print statement `print(l, r)` will output these values.

Output: **5 10**
