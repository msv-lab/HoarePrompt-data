Output State: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, and `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `N + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `N`. The variable `s` will be `N` since it is updated to `i` whenever `nums[i]` changes. The variable `num` will be set to the last element of the list `nums`, which is `nums[N]`. The list `arr` will contain all the transitions where `num` changes, starting from the first element and ending with the last transition before the loop exits.
