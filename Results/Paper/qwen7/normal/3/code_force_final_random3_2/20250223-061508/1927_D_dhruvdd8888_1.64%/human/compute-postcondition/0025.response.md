Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `s` is 3, `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, and `arr` contains tuples (2, 0, `nums[3]`), (1, 1, `nums[3]`), and (2, 3, `nums[3]`).**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` is now equal to `nums[3]`. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
