Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `eli` is the index found by bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0)), and if `tc > 5`, the program continues to the next iteration without making any changes to the variables.**

Explanation: The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` finds the index in the sorted list `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list sorted. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged unless the condition `tc > 5` is met, in which case the program would skip further execution and not modify these variables. Since no such condition is given here, the variables remain as described in the initial state, with `eli` being the result of the `bisect_left` operation.
