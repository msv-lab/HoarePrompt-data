Postcondition: `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple split by space and converted to integers, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `tc` is greater than 5, and the loop continues. If `tc > 5`, the conditions and assignments remain unchanged. There is no else part, so the postcondition remains the same as the if part.
