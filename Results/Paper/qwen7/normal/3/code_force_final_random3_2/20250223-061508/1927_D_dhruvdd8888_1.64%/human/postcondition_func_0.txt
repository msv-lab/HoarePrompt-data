The function processes an input list of integers and handles a series of queries. It first identifies transitions in the list where the value changes and stores these transitions in a list. Then, for each query, it finds the relevant transition and determines the range within the query bounds. Based on this range, it outputs either the start and end indices or -1, -1 if the query cannot be fully satisfied.
