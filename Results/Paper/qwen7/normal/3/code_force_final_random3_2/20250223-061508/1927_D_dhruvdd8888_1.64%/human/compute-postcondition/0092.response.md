Postcondition: **`eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple split by space and converted to integers, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `tc` is greater than 5; regardless of the condition `s == 1`, `s`, `e`, and `_` are updated to the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.**
