Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer again, `m` is the length of the list `l`, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. This updates the value of `l` but does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `e`, `m`, or the second assignment to `n`. The set `e` remains unchanged as it was previously defined based on the original `l`.
