Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`. After executing the if-else block, either the number 1 is present in the list `l` or it is not in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the length of the list `l`. Since the if condition `1 in l` does not change the variables' values or their relationships, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is reassigned to the length of the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
