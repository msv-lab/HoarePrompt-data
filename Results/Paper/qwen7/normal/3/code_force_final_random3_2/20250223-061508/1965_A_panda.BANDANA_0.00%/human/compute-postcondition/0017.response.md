Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer, `e` is updated to be the set of unique elements from the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `e = set(l)` creates a set `e` containing only the unique elements from the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
