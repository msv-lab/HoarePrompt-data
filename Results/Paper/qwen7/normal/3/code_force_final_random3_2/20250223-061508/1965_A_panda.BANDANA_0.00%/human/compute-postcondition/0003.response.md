Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `l` by taking a single line of input, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer.
