Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - The postcondition is that if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

6. **Postcondition for Next Iteration:**
   - We need to check the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` with `i = 2`.
   - If this condition holds, `sum` will be updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `sum` will remain `i * n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is still greater than or equal to 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
