Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly defined in the given state, but it will start from 1 according to the loop definition (`range(1, n + 1)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute at least once. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `j` is not part of the loop head, so its value (which is `n + 1`) does not need to be adjusted.
   - `r` and `sum` are not part of the loop head either, so their values (0 and 0 respectively) do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
