Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific range. However, we know it will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is a number greater than or equal to 1)
