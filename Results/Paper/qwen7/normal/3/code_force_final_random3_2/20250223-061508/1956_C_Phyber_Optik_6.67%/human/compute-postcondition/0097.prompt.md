Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final value of `sum` is the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` multiplied by `n`, or the triangular number formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), whichever is smaller at each step of the iteration.

In more detail, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, if \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) is greater than \( i \times n \), then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by \( i \times n \).

After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` will still be the input integer, and `sum` will be the total accumulated value based on the above rules.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is the input integer, and `r` is 0. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the program does not change the values of `j`, `n`, and `r`. If `j` is greater than `n`, the program does not change the values of `j`, `n`, and `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is the input integer, and `r` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3 and `n` is the input integer (and must be at least 2). Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `j` and `n`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
