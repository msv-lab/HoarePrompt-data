Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer (though `r` is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is greater than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The first argument `2` is a constant integer.
2. The second argument is `j % n`, which means the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since `j` is greater than `n`, the remainder when `j` is divided by `n` will be a value between `0` and `n-1` inclusive.
3. The `end=' '` ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

Therefore, the output will be the number `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, followed by a space.

Output: **2 [remainder of j divided by n] **
