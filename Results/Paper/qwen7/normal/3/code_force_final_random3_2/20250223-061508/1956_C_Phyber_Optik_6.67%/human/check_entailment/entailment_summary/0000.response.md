Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation either permutes the rows or columns.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \), which can be achieved by setting each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( n \).
   - The solution provided aims to achieve this maximum sum using a combination of row and column permutations.
3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum and the additional integer `r`.
   - It then performs the required number of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The logic for calculating `r` and the sum seems correct.
   - The operations printed follow the rules specified: they are either row or column permutations, and the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

Given these points, the code appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
