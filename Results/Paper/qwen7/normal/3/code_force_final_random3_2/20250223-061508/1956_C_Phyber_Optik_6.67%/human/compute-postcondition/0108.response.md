Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and sum is i * n**.

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the expression `i * n` evaluates to `n`. Since the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n)` holds true, it means that `sum` is updated to `n`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
