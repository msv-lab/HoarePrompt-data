Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user, and it must still be within the specified range (1 to 500).
