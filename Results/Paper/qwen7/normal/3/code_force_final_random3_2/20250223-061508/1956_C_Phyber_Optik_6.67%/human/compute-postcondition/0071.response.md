Output State: The final value of `sum` is the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` multiplied by `n`, or the triangular number formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), whichever is smaller at each step of the iteration.

In more detail, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, if \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) is greater than \( i \times n \), then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by \( i \times n \).

After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` will still be the input integer, and `sum` will be the total accumulated value based on the above rules.
