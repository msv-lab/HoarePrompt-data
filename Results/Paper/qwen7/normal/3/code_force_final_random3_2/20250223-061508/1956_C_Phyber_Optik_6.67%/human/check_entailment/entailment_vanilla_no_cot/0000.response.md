Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Current Approach**:
   - The current implementation attempts to calculate a sum and a value `r` which seems intended to determine how many operations are needed.
   - It then prints out operations without actually ensuring the matrix is filled to maximize the sum.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum and `r` is flawed and does not align with the problem statement.
   - The actual operations performed do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To maximize the sum, one efficient approach is to fill the matrix such that each cell \( a_{i,j} \) is assigned the maximum possible value within the constraints of the problem.
   - This can be achieved by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations to fill the matrix with values from 1 to \( n^2 \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the sum to 0
        sum = 0
        
        # Perform n row operations to fill the first n rows
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(i * (n - 1) + 1, i * n + 1))
            sum += i * n
        
        # Perform n column operations to fill the remaining cells
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(j, j + n * (n - 1) + 1, n))
            sum += n * (n - 1) + j
        
        # Output the maximum sum and the number of operations
        print(sum, 2 * n)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum and uses exactly \( 2n \) operations.
