Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine Initial Conditions:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the initial values of `j` and `n`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n + r + 1`.

3. **Understand the Final Conditions:**
   - After the loop completes, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
   - `i` will be equal to `n + 1`.
   - `sum` will be calculated based on certain conditions involving `n` and `r`.
   - `r` will be the largest `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - Since `t` must be greater than 0 after the loop, we need to ensure that the loop can run at least once.
   - For the loop to run at least once, `n + r + 1` must be greater than 1. This implies that `n + r` must be at least 0. However, since `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 500, `r` must be non-negative.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, which means `n + r` should be at least 1. Given the constraints, this is always true if `n` is at least 1.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `n` and `r`, ensuring that the loop can execute at least once and that `n` is within the specified range.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, `r` must be non-negative**
