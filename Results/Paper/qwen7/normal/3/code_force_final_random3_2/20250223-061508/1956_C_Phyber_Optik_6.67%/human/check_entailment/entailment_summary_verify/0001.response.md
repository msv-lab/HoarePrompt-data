### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  1. Permute the elements of a row.
  2. Permute the elements of a column.
- The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \), which can be achieved by setting every element to 1.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the sum of the matrix as follows:
     ```python
     if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
         r = i
         sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
     else:
         sum += i * n
     ```
   - This logic seems to be incorrect. The sum should be calculated as \( n^2 \), which is the maximum possible sum when all elements are set to 1.
   - The variable `r` is not used correctly in the context of the sum calculation.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The number of operations is calculated as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( n(n+1)/2 > r \times n \).
   - This logic is also incorrect because the number of operations should be exactly \( n \) for setting the first element of each row and \( n \) for setting the first element of each column, totaling \( 2n \) operations.

3. **Operations Execution**:
   - The code prints the sum and the number of operations as calculated.
   - It then performs the operations:
     ```python
     for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
         if j <= n:
             print(1, j, end=' ')
             print(*range(1, n + 1))
         else:
             print(2, j % n, end=' ')
             print(*range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - This part of the code is attempting to set the first element of each row and column to the appropriate value, but the logic is flawed due to the incorrect sum calculation and the incorrect determination of `r`.

#### Correct Approach:
- To achieve the maximum sum \( n^2 \), we need to set all elements of the matrix to 1.
- We can do this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations.
- For each row operation, set the first element of each row to 1.
- For each column operation, set the first element of each column to 1.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(n * n, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Final Evaluation:
The provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed sum calculation and the incorrect determination of the number of operations. The correct approach involves setting all elements to 1, which can be done in exactly \( 2n \) operations.

**Final: False**
