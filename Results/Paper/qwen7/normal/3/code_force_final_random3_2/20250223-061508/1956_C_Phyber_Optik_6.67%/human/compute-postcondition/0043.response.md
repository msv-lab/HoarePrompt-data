Given the initial state:
- `j` is defined as `n + r + 1`
- `n` remains the same
- `r` remains the same

We need to evaluate the expression `2, j % n, end=' '`.

Let's break it down:

1. `2` is a constant integer.
2. `j % n` means the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since `j = n + r + 1`, we can substitute this into the modulus operation:
   \[
   j \% n = (n + r + 1) \% n
   \]
   The term `n % n` is always 0, so:
   \[
   (n + r + 1) \% n = r + 1 \% n
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   r + 1 \% n
   \]
   If `r + 1` is less than `n`, then `r + 1 \% n` is simply `r + 1`. If `r + 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `r + 1 \% n` is the remainder when `r + 1` is divided by `n`.

3. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that there is a space after the printed values.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, r + 1 if r + 1 < n, else (r + 1) % n**
