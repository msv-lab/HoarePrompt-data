Based on the initial state provided, the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n + r`, and at the end of the loop, `j` is `n + r`. This means that the condition `j > n` holds true, and `r` remains non-negative but does not change further. 

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into individual arguments for the `print` function.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n**
