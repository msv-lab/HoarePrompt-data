Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 3, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` added to the previous value of `sum`**.

The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `sum`, it remains as an unspecified variable in the output state. The other variables (`i` and `r`) remain unchanged.
