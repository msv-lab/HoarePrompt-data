Output State: **`j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `sum` contains the sum described in the initial state, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`j`, `i`, `sum`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
