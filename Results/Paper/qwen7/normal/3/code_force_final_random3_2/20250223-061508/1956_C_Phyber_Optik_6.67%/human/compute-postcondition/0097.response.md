Output State: The loop will have executed from `j = 1` to `j = n + r + 1`. Given the initial conditions and the fact that `r` is not changed within the loop, `r` will remain 0. Therefore, the loop will run from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`.

For each iteration:
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop prints `1` followed by `j` and then a range from `1` to `n`.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop prints `2` followed by `j % n` and then a range from `1` to `n`.

After all iterations, the variable `j` will be `n + 1`, `n` will still be the input integer, and `r` will be `0`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:
Output State: `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, and `r` is `0`. The loop has printed the specified sequences for each value of `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.
