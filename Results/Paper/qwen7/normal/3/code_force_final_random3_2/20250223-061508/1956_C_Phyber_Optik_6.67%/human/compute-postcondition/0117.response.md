Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, or `2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `sum` does not change based on the loop itself; it is determined by the postcondition outside the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
