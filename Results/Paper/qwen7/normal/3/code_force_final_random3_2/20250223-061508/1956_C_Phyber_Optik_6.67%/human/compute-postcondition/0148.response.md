Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` will be the input integer, and `r` will remain non-negative and unchanged. The variable `sum` will contain the sum calculated during the loop's execution, and `t` will be 0 since all test cases have been processed. The loop will have printed sequences for each value of `j` from 1 to `n + r + 1`, following the specified rules for printing based on whether `j` is less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`.
