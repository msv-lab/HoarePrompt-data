Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is 3; `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we keep it as "greater than or equal to 1". The other variables (`i` and `r`) remain unchanged.
