Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop increments `j` from 1 to `n + r`, and at the end of the loop, the final value of `j` is `n + r`.
- The condition `j > n` holds true at the end of the loop, meaning `r` remains non-negative but does not change further.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n**
