Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, and `sum` is `sum + 3 * n`.**

Explanation: The variable `sum` is updated by adding `3 * n` to its current value. The initial condition for `sum` is given by whether `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `2 * n` or not, but this condition does not change after the code execution. Therefore, the output state retains the initial condition for `sum` while updating its value by adding `3 * n`.
