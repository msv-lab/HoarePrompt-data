### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the elements of a row or a column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - The sum is calculated as follows:
     - If \( n(n+1)/2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \) for some \( i \), then the sum includes \( n(n+1)/2 \).
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the sum.
   - The number of operations required is \( n + r \), where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( n(n+1)/2 > r \times n \).
   - The solution prints the sum and the number of operations.
   - It then performs the operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it sets the first element of each row to the corresponding index (i.e., \( a_{i,1} = i \)).
     - For the remaining operations, it sets the first element of each column to the corresponding index (i.e., \( a_{1,i} = i \)).

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum seems correct. However, the sum calculation is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the sum of the matrix.
   - The correct approach to maximize the sum would be to fill the matrix with the sequence \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n^2 \). This can be done by setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( (i-1) \cdot n + j \).
   - The number of operations is correctly determined as \( n + r \), which is within the limit of \( 2n \).
   - The operations performed ensure that the first element of each row and column is set to the appropriate value, but they do not necessarily maximize the sum.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should fill the matrix with the sequence \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n^2 \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations.
   - For row operations, set \( a_{i, 1} = i \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - For column operations, set \( a_{1, j} = j \) for \( j = 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

### Conclusion:
The original solution does not correctly calculate the sum and does not maximize the sum of the matrix. The correct approach involves filling the matrix with the sequence \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n^2 \), which requires exactly \( 2n \) operations.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
