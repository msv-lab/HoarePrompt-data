Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided solution attempts to calculate the sum and the number of operations needed for each test case.
3. The logic in the code seems to be trying to distribute the values in a way that maximizes the sum, but there are several issues:
   - The calculation of `sum` does not correctly reflect the desired sum of the matrix.
   - The logic for determining `r` is flawed and does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The printing of operations does not follow the problem's constraints and does not ensure the maximum sum is achieved.
4. Specifically, the code snippet provided does not actually perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, it seems to be attempting to calculate some sum based on the given conditions, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
