Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mid_sum` the value of `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `mid`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `mid` being equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2 and `l` still being less than `h`.
