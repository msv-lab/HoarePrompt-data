Output State: **`max_diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `next_max_diff` is either the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is 6, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The line `index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 6) to the variable `index`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` retain their previous states, and `index` is updated to 6.
