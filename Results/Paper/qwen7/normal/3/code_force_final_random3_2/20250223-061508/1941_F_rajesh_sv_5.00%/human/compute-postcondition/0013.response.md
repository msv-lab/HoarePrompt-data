Output State: **`max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is None, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `diff` to `next_max_diff`. Since `diff` is initially `A[1] - A[0]` and is greater than `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
