Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is updated to `mid + 1`; `mid` is no longer valid; `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is no longer used in subsequent calculations, it is no longer valid. All other variables retain their previous values.
