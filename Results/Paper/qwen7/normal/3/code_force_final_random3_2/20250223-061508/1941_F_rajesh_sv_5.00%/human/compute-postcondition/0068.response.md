Postcondition: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is the final index calculated based on the condition inside the loop, `h` is the final value determined by the loop's termination condition, and `l` is the final index which is the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`, and `l` will retain their respective states as described in the precondition and the if part of the if-else block.
