Output State: **`testcases' is the result of the function `func_3()`.**

The code `testcases = func_3()` assigns the return value of the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values or types of `testcases`. However, we know that `testcases` now holds whatever `func_3()` returns. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `d`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
