Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is A[3] - A[2], `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains None, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `diff` (which is `A[3] - A[2]`) to `next_max_diff`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
