Postcondition: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the larger of `A[5] - A[4]` and the previous `next_max_diff`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains None, `i` is 6, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, and if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.**
