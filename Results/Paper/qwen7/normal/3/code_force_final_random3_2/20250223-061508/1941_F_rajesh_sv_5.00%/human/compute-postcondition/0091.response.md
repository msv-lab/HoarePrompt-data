Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is updated to `mid + 1`; `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The new value of `l` is explicitly set to `mid + 1`, and `mid` is recalculated based on the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`.
