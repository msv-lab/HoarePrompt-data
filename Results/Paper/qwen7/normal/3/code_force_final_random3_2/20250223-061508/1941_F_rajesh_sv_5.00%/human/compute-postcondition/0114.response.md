Output State: **`mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula is used to find the middle point between `l` and `h`. The initial condition that `l` must be less than `h` remains valid after the code execution.
