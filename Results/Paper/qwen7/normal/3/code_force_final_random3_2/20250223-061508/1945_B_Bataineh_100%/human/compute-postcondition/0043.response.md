Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It returns a value based on the relationship between a, b, and m.**

Note: The given function signature `def func():` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the problem statement, the function processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` within specified ranges, and the value of `t` (though not explicitly passed) seems to be related to the number of test cases. The function's output depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
