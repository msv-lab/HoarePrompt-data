Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `m`. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it prints `2`. If `m` is less than one but not the other, it prints either `2 + m // b` or `2 + m // a`. Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated values for each test case.**
