Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values from the input split.**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 2, and `i` is still 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now specific integers based on the input provided.
