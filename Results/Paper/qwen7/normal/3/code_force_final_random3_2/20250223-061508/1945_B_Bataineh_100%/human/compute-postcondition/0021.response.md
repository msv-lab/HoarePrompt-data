The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `t` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and after the execution of the if-else block, `m` satisfies either `m < a` and `m < b`, `m < b` and `m > a`, `m <= a`, or `m >= b`.**
