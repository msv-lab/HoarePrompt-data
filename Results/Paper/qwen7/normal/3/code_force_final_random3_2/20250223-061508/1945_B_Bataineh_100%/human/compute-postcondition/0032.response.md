Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, and their values are the integers split from the input.**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
