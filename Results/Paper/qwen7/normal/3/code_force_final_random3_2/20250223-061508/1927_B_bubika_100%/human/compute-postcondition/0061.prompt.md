Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; `a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is the concatenation of all values of `a[x]` for each `i` in `s`, and `b` has each index incremented by the count of its occurrence in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `s` is now empty since all its elements have been processed. The list `b` is a list of 26 zeros with one element incremented for each integer in `s`. The variable `t` remains 1 if the user input was greater than 1; otherwise, it is not specified how `t` is set initially or changed during the loop. The variable `n` remains as the input integer. The variable `r` is a string that starts as an empty string and is built up by concatenating characters from the list `b` corresponding to the indices of the elements in `s`. The variable `i` is the current element being processed in the loop, which would be the last element of `s` before it becomes empty. The variable `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.

In simpler terms: After all iterations, `s` is empty, `b` has some of its elements incremented based on the integers in `s`, `t` is 1 if the user input was greater than 1, `n` is the original input integer, `r` is a string made by concatenating specific characters from `b`, `i` is the last integer from `s`, and `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `total` is 10, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of 26 integers where each element in `s` has been incremented by 1, `t` is 1 if the user input was greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a string consisting of the characters 'a' repeated for each element in `s`, `i` is the last integer from `s`, and `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.

In this final state, the variable `total` remains unchanged at 10 because it was not modified within the loop. The list `s` still exists but is no longer being modified. The list `b` has been updated such that each element present in `s` has its corresponding index in `b` incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The string `r` is constructed by concatenating the character 'a' for each element in `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `x` reflect the state after the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
