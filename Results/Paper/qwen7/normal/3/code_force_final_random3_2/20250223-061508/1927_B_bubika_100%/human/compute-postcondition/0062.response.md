Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case within `t`, the function takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes the list `a` for each test case defined by `t` and `n`.**
