Output State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 1 (if user_input > 1); `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `s`. The other variables (`b`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
