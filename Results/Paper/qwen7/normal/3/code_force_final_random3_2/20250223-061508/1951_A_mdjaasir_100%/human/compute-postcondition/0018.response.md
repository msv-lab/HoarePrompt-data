Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` is an input integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- `a` is an input string from the user.
- `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`, and it is explicitly stated that `count` is equal to 2.
- The character following the first '1' in `a` is '1'.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Output: **NO**
