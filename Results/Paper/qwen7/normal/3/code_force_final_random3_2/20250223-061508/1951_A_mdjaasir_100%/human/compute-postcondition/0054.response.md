Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. The postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether `count` equals 2 or not, as the actions within both the if and else parts do not alter the variables beyond checking the condition and leaving the variables as they were.
