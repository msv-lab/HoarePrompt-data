Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is an integer input split from the input string, and the first element is 0.**

Explanation: The code `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then prepends a 0 to the resulting list. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new list `v` is created with its first element set to 0 and the rest of the elements being the integers inputted.
