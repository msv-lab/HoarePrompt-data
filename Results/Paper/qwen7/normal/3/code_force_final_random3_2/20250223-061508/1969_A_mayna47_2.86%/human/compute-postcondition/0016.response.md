Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\)
- `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(2)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, but it does not affect the `print(2)` statement directly.
3. The expression `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. Since `i` is 2, this means `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2. This information is not needed to determine the output of `print(2)`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2.

Output: **2**
