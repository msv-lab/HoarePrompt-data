Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n` inclusive. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\).
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: The condition for `n` remains the same, i.e., \(2 < n \leq 50\).

6. **Verify the postcondition for the next iteration**: The postcondition `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` needs to hold true for `i = 2`. Therefore, `v[v[v[2]]]` should not be equal to 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\).
- `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\), and `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2.**
