Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer with the value 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2 and `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where each element is an integer input split from the input string, and the first element is 0.
