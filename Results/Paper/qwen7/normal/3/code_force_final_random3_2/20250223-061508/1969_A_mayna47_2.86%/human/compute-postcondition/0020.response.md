Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\)
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`
   - If `v[v[v[2]]]` equals `2`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `i` and `n` and `v[v[v[i]]]` remains not equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the problem statement mentions that if `v[v[v[2]]]` equals `2`, the function returns None; otherwise, it does not change the values of `i` and `n`.

4. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` remains the same, so it is still an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\).
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is still not equal to `i`, so `v[v[v[3]]]` is not equal to `3`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\), and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`**.
