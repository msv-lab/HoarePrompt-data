Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 < n â‰¤ 50
- The value of `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(2)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. The value of `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`. Since `i` is 1, this means `v[v[v[1]]] = 1`.
3. The print statement `print(2)` simply outputs the integer 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
