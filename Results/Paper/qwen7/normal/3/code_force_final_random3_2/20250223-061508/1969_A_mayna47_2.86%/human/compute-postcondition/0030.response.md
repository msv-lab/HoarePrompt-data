Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `p`, then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns. If no such index exists, it prints `3` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.**
