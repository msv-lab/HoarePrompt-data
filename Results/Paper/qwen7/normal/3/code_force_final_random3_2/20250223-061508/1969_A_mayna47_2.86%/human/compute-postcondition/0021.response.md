Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\). This means `n` can take any integer value between 3 and 50, inclusive.
- `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. Since `i` is 3, this means `v[v[v[3]]]` is not equal to 3.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(2)
```

This code simply prints the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n` and `v[v[v[3]]]`.

Output: **2**
