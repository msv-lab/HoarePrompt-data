The function processes a list `c` of `n` positive integers and handles `q` queries. For each query, it checks a range `[l_i, r_i]` within the list and returns 'YES' if the sum of elements in the range `[x, y]` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x` values in the same range, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
