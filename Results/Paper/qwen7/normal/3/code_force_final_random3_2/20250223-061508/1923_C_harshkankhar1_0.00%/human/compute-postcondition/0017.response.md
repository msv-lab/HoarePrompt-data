Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the new variables `x` and `y` are assigned the integer values from the input.
