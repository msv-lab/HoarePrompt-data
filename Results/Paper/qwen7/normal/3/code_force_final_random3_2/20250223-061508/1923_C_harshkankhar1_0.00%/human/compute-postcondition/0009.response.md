Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1.
   - `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
   - `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `current_i`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Determine the new value of `x` and `b[i]`**:
   - `x` will be determined based on the value of `a[current_i + 1]`.
   - `b[current_i + 1]` will be `b[current_i] + x`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `x` will be 1 if `a[current_i + 1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` will be 2.
- `b[current_i + 1]` will be `b[current_i] + x`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `a[current_i + 1]` or `b[current_i]` from the given information, we express the state in terms of the conditions.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`, where `i` is `current_i + 1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `current_i + 1`.**
