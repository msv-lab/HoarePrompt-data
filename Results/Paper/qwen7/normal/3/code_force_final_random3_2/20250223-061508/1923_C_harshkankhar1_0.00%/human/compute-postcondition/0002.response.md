Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered as input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

The code initializes a list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
