Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`, where `i` is `current_i + 1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `current_i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i]` by adding `x` to `b[i - 1]`. The value of `x` is determined based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. However, since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, `x` remains as either 1 or 2. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `current_i + 1` is still valid. The values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are updated according to the rule, but their specific values depend on the conditions mentioned.
