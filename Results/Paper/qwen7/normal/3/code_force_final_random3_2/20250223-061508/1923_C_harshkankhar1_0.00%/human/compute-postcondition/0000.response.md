Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

The code `n, q = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer, while `n` and `q` are the integers input by the user.
