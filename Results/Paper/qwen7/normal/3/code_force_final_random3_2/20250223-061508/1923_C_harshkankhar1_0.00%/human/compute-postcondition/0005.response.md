Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 else 2; `b[1]` is `b[0]` + x**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i]` to be the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` becomes `b[1]`, which is assigned the value of `b[0] + x`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
