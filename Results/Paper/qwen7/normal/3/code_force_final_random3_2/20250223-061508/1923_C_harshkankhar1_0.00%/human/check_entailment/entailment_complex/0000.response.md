Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions involving sums and distinct values.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to process each test case and handle the queries.
   - It correctly initializes the variables `n` and `q` from the input.
   - It constructs the prefix sum array `a` and another array `b` which seems intended to represent the sum of distinct values.
   - However, the construction of `b` is flawed because `x` is always set to 1 or 2 regardless of the value of `a[i]`. This means `b` will not correctly represent the sum of distinct values as required.
   - The function then prints the prefix sum array `a`, which is unnecessary for solving the problem.
   - The function correctly handles the queries but uses the incorrect array `b` to make the decision, leading to incorrect results.

Given the above analysis, the function is incorrect because it misinterprets the construction of the array `b` and uses it incorrectly in the query handling part.

Correctness: **False**
