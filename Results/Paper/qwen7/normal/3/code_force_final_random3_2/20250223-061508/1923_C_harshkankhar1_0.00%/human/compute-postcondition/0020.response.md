Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is the first number from the input, `y` is the second number from the input**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The initial conditions for `q` and the types of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
