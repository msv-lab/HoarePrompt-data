Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n`, inclusive, and for each `j` from 0 to `n`, `q[j] > 0`. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` will be equal to `eta_ln`, `res` will be the sum of all the increments calculated in each iteration of the loop, and `rho` will be the cumulative sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values for each `j` from 0 to `eta_ln-1`. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` remains a list containing integers from the input, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer less than 3, and `w` remains a list of integers from the input.**
