Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta_ln` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is `n + 1` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `rho` is `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Since `rho` is `n`, the value of `n` is the same as `rho`. However, the value of `rho` is not explicitly given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the expression without knowing `n`.

Given the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, where `n` is the value of `rho`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the value of rho)**
