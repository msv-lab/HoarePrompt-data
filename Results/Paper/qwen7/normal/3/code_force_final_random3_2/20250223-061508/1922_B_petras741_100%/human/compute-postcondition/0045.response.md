Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 4
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 3
   - `res` is increased by several terms involving `q[eta[i]]` and `rho`
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[4]]`
   - `rho` is further increased by `q[eta[j]]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, eta_ln):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `eta_ln - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - Since `eta_ln` must be greater than 3, it remains unchanged.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - `j` will be 5.
   - `eta_ln` remains the same and must still be greater than 3.
   - `res` and `rho` are updated based on the values of `q[eta[i]]` and `q[eta[j]]`, but these updates do not change the conditions for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` is 5
- `eta_ln` must be greater than 3

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is 5, `eta_ln` must be greater than 3**
