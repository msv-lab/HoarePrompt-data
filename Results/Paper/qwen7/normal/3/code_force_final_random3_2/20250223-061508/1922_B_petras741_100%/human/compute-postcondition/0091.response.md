Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially `n + 1`.
   - `eta_ln` is initially `n + 1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(1, eta_ln)` will execute as long as `1 <= j < eta_ln`. Given that `j` starts at `n + 1` and `eta_ln` also starts at `n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `j` is already equal to `eta_ln`.

4. **Adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the initial values such that `1 <= j < eta_ln` holds true. This means `eta_ln` should be greater than `j`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables (`rho` and `res`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `eta_ln` and `j` such that `1 <= j < eta_ln`.

**Final State**:
State: **`eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
