Output State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `j` is `n`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `eta`. This does not affect the values of `w`, `n`, `t`, `j`, or `q`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with the addition of `eta` being an empty list.
