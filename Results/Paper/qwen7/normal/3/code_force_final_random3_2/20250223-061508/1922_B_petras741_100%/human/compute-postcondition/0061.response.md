Output State: **`j` is 0; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is initially 0 and `w` is not defined in the given information, we assume `w[0]` refers to the first element of the list `w`. However, since `w` is not explicitly defined, we only know that `j` remains 0 and `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
