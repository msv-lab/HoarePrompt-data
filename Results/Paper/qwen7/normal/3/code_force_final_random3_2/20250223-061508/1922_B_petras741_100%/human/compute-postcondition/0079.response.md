Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta` contains the value `[n, j, j]`**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Initially, `eta` contains the value `[n, j]`. After appending `j`, `eta` becomes `[n, j, j]`. The values of `j` and `q[j]` remain unchanged.
