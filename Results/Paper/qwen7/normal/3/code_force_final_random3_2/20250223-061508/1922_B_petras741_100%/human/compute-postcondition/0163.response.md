Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[0]]` and all `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration of the loop, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is `n + eta_ln` and must be less than `eta_ln`, and `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After the if-else block executes, `rho` will be `q[eta[0]]` if the length of `eta` (`eta_ln`) is 1. Otherwise, `rho` will be the sum of `q[eta[0]]` and all `q[eta[j]]` values encountered during the loop, where `j` ranges from `n + eta_ln` to `eta_ln - 1`. The variable `eta_ln` remains as the length of the list `eta`, which contains indices `i` from `0` to `n` where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution. The variable `j` will be `n + eta_ln`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `res` will hold the cumulative result of the summation performed in each iteration of the loop.
