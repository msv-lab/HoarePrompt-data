Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for j in range(n):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.

### Current State:
- `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
- This means that `j` was some value such that `j < n` and the increment operation occurred.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration).
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

### Updated State:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
- The condition `j < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j` must be less than `n`**.

To be more precise and clear:
- The exact value of `j` is not specified, but it will be `j + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `j + 1 < n`.

So, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j + 1` must be less than `n`**.
