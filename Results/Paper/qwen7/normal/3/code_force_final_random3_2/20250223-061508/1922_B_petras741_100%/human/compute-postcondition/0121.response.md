Output State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `j` is 5, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[4]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[j]]` (which is `q[w[5]]`) is incremented by 1.**

This means that the list `q` now has its elements at indices `w[0]` and `w[5]` incremented by 1, while all other elements remain 0.
