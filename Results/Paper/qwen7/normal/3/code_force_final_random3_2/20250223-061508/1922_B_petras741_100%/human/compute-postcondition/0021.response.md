Output State: **`eta` is `[0, 1]`, `j` is `1`**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`. Initially, `eta` is `[0]`. After appending `j`, `eta` becomes `[0, 1]`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid but is not directly affected by the code.
