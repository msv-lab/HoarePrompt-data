Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `eta[j]` is unchanged, `q` is unchanged, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `rho` is incremented by `q[eta[j]]`. The other variables (`res`, `eta[j]`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
