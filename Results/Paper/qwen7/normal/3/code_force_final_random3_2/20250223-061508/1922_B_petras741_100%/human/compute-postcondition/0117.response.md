Output State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `j` is 0, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Initially, `j` is 0, so `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
