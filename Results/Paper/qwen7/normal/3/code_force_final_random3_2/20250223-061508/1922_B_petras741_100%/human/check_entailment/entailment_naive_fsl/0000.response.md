Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program does not check if the chosen sticks can form a triangle (i.e., if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick). Instead, it simply counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks regardless of whether they can form a triangle or not.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 2
```

The output of the program would be:
```
4
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
4
```

But more importantly, for the input:
```
3
2 2 3
```

The program would output:
```
9
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1
```

This is because the only valid combination is (2, 2, 2), but the program counts (2, 2, 3) as a valid combination, which is incorrect since 2 + 2 is not greater than 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not properly check the triangle inequality condition.
