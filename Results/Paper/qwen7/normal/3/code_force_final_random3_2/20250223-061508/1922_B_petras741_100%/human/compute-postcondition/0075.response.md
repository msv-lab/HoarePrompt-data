Output State: **`j` is `n`, `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the value `[n, j]`, and `eta` is a list.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is `n` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` now contains both its original value `n` and the new value `j`.
