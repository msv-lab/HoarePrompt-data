Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `j` will increment by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is added to `eta`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, no additional variables are changed.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` increments by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition `n >= 0` still holds true.
   - If `q[j+1]` is greater than 0, no additional variables are changed.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `eta` will now include `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `q[j + 1]` is greater than 0, no additional variables are changed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `eta` includes `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and if the current value of `q[j + 1]` is greater than 0, the function does not change any additional variables.**
