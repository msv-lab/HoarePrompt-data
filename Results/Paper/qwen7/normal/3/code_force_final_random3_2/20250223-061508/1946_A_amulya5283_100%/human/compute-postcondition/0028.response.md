Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `n` equals 1, then no changes are made to `mdx`, `i`, and `res`. Otherwise, `mdx` remains the same, `i` equals `n - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
