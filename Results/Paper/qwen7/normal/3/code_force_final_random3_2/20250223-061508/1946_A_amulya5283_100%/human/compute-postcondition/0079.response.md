Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns the results for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a number of elements in an array along with the array itself. The function processes each test case and returns the results accordingly.
