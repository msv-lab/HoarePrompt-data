Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, and `n` is not equal to 1; `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Since `n` is an integer, `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. The value of `mdx` depends on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
