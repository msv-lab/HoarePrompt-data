Output State: **After all iterations, `mdx` remains the same, `i` equals `n - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `mdx` to `n-1`. For each iteration, if the element at `mdx` is equal to the current element `a[i]`, the counter `res` is incremented. After all iterations, `res` will hold the total count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The value of `mdx` does not change during the loop, and `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after the last iteration.
