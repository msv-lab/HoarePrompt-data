Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `t` is `t - 1` (though this is not relevant to the loop itself).
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 1`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
   - `res` is 1.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is `mdx`.
   - The current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx` and the loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `mdx + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `mdx + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to `mdx + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `res` is 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and the current value of `a[mdx + 1]` is yet to be determined.**
