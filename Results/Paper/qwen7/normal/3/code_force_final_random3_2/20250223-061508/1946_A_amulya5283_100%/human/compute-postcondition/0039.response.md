Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `res` is 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
