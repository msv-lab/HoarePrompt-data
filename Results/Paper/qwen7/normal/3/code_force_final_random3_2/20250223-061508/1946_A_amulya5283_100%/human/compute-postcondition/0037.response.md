Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - **`i`**: This variable starts at `mdx` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
   - **`mdx`**: Given as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, this value is derived from `n` and does not change within the loop.
   - **`n`**: This is an input integer and determines the upper bound of the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `mdx` is derived from `n`, no adjustment is needed for `mdx` itself.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to `mdx` and `n` must be at least `mdx + 1` to ensure there are elements to iterate over.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be initialized to `mdx`.
- `n` should be at least `mdx + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`**
