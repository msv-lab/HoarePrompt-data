Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but since `t` is not explicitly given an initial value, we consider it as a symbolic expression rather than a concrete value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
