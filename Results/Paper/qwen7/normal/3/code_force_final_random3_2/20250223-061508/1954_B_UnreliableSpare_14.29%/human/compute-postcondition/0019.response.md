Postcondition: `flag` remains `False`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`, and if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
