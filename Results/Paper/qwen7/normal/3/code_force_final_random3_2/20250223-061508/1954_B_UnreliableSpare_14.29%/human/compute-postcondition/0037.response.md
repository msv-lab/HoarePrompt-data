Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr` and is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before.**

This means that the variable `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while `i` remains an index within the bounds of the list `arr` and is still `i + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state.
