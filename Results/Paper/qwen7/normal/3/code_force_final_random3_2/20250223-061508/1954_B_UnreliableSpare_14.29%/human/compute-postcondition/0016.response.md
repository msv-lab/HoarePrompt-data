Output State: **`flag` remains `False`, `i` is `4`, `n` must be greater than `4`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The line `flag = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `flag`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
