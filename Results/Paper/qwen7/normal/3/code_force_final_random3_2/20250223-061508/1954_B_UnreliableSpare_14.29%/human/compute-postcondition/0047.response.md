Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`.
- `cnt` is updated to be the new value of `ans`.
- `flag` is `False`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

Since `ans` is defined as the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`, and `cnt` is updated to be the new value of `ans`, the value of `ans` is already determined.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr plus one for any segment that does not start with val)**
