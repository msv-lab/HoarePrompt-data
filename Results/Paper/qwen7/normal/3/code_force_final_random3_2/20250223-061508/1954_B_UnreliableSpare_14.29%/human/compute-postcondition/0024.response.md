Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 4.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given to be an input integer greater than 4, it satisfies this condition.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means we need to confirm that `n` is indeed greater than 0 (which it is, since it is greater than 4), and `i` should start from 0 up to `n-1`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should start from 0.
- `n` should remain greater than 0 (which it already is).

Since `n` is greater than 4, it is inherently greater than 0. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`.

**Final State:**
State: **`flag` remains False, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity')**
