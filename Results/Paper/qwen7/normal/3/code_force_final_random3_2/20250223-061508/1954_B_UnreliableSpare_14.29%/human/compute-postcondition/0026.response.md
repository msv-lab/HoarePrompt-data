Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `val` is an integer, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the variable `cnt` by 1. Since the initial values of `arr`, `i`, `val`, and `cnt` are unchanged, they remain as described in the initial state. The only change is that `cnt` has been incremented by 1.
