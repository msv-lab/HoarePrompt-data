Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt` + 1, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to the minimum of its current value and `cnt + 1` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. The initial conditions for `arr`, `i`, and the relationship between `ans` and `cnt` remain unchanged, but `ans` and `cnt` are now updated based on the condition of `arr[i]` relative to `val`.
