Output State: **`arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`.**

In this code, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `val` remain unchanged from the initial state.
