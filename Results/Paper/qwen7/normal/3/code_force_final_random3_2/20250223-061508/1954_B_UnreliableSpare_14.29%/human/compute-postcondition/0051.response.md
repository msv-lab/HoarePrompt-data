Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It checks if the list \( a \) is monotonically the same (i.e., all elements are identical). If the list is not monotonically the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list, excluding the first element of the segment. The function then prints either \(-1\) if the list is monotonically the same or the calculated minimum count otherwise.**
