Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `flag` is False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`.
