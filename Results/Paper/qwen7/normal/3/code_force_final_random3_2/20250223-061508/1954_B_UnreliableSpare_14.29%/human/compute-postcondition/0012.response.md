Output State: **`flag` is False, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
