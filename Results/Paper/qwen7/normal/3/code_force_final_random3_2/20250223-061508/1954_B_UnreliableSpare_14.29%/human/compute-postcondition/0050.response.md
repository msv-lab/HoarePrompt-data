Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs according to certain rules and returns a result for each test case.
