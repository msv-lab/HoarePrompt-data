### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be reduced to an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The array is initially beautiful, meaning it can be reduced to a single value by the given operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of removals to break this property.
   - If the array already consists of all identical elements, no removals are needed, and the answer is -1.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
     - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if the array is uniform using a simple loop.
     - This part is correct and works as expected.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive non-uniform segments.
     - This part is where the logic is flawed. The code does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array case correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the logic for identifying the minimum number of removals is incorrect. The code only considers the first element and does not account for other possible segments that could be broken to make the array non-beautiful.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`.
     - The array is not uniform.
     - The code incorrectly calculates the minimum number of removals as 1, but the correct answer should be 1 (removing the second element).

7. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It checks if the list \( a \) is monotonically the same (i.e., all elements are identical). If the list is not monotonically the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list, excluding the first element of the segment.
     - This summary is misleading because it does not accurately describe the logic used in the code.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement provided. The logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is flawed and does not account for all possible segments that could be broken to make the array non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
