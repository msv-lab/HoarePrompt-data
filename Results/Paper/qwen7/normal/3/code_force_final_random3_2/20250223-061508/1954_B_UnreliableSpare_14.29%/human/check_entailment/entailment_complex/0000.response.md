Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
3. The provided code attempts to solve this by checking if the array is already monotonically the same (all elements are identical). If it is, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
4. If the array is not monotonically the same, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array, excluding the first element of the segment, which would need to be removed to break the beauty condition.
5. The logic in the code seems to correctly identify when the array is monotonically the same and handles the case where it is not by calculating the minimum count of consecutive occurrences.
6. The code uses a simple and efficient approach to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, iterating through the array only once.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
