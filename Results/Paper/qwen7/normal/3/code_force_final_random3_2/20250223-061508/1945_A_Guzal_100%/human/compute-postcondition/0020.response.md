Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `k` was initially assigned the value `a + (b + c) // 3`. After executing `k += 1`, `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
