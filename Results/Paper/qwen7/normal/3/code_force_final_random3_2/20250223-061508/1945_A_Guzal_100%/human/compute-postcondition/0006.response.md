Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is an integer not divisible by 3.
- `b % 3 + c` is less than 3.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
