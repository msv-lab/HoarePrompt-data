Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on `t`. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user.
