Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that update a contiguous subarray to a single value (the MEX of the subarray). The operations are limited to 5 * 10^5.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the maximum sum achievable by splitting the array into subarrays and applying the MEX operation. It uses recursion and memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **func_2**: This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It recursively identifies the subarrays where the MEX operation needs to be applied.
   - **make_stairs**: This function constructs a staircase pattern in the array to ensure the MEX operation can be applied effectively.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the maximum sum by considering all possible ways to split the array and apply the MEX operation.
   - The `func_2` function correctly identifies the subarrays where the MEX operation should be applied to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the array is structured in a way that allows the MEX operation to be applied efficiently.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases like arrays of length 1 and arrays where all elements are already the same.
   - The recursive nature of the functions ensures that the solution works for arrays of length up to 18, as specified in the problem.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the functions are designed to handle the problem constraints and edge cases correctly, and the logic appears sound, the program is likely to produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
