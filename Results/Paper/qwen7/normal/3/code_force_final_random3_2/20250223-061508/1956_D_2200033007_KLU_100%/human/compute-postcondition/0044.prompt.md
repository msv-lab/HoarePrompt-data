You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, and start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= n - 1. The variable res is a list that will store the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `is_already_stairs` will remain True, and `j` will be equal to `i`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `is_already_stairs` will remain True, and `j` will be equal to `i`.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program does not return anything as there is no return statement in the provided code.
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` will remain True, and `j` will be equal to `i`. The value of `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: `i` must be greater than 0; `start_index` and `i` define a valid range; `j` is `start_index + i + 1`; all elements in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) in `arr` are now equal to `i`.
        #
        #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will still be greater than 0, and the range defined by `start_index` and `i` will remain valid. The variable `j` will have reached `start_index + i + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. All elements within the specified range in the array `arr` will have been set to the value of `i`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` will remain True, `j` will be equal to `i`, and either `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called when `arr[start_index + i] == i`, or `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called when `i` is greater than 0 and `arr[start_index + i] != i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter i, which is an index of a list arr. It does not return anything as there is no return statement in the provided code.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return anything as there is no return statement in the provided code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
