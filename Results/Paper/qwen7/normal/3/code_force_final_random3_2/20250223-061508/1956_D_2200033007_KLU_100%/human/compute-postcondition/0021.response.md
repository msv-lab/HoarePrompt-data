Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is True, `j` is equal to `i`, `i` is 0, `res` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`, `arr[start_index]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `arr[start_index] = 1` updates the value of `arr[start_index]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
