Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array `arr` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `arr[l:r+1]`.

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`: This function computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
   - `func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`: This function returns the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - `make_stairs(i: int) -> None`: This function constructs a "staircase" pattern in the array to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of the subarray.
   - It recursively splits the subarray into smaller parts and calculates the maximum sum for each part.
   - However, the approach seems overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases, especially for larger arrays.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function generates the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It relies on the results from `func_1` to determine the optimal operations.
   - The logic here also seems overly complex and may not be efficient or correct for all cases.

5. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function constructs a staircase pattern in the array.
   - It is called by `func_2` to ensure the array reaches the desired state.
   - The logic here is also complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Issues Identified:
- **Complexity**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` have recursive calls that might lead to high computational complexity, potentially exceeding the \(5 \times 10^5\) operation limit.
- **Edge Cases**: The functions do not handle all edge cases properly, especially for small arrays or specific patterns in the input.
- **Optimality**: The functions do not guarantee an optimal solution in terms of achieving the maximum sum efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and potential issues with handling edge cases, the provided functions are likely incorrect for the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
