Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not seem to address the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. Instead, they appear to be attempting to solve a different problem related to partitioning the array into subarrays and calculating some kind of value for those partitions.

The problem requires us to use at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting a segment of the array to the minimum excluded value (MEX) of that segment. However, the provided functions do not seem to perform these operations or calculate the MEX values correctly.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
1 3 9
```

The expected output is:
```
13 0
```

But running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result because the functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting segments to their MEX values.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for at least one case, hence the correctness is **False**.
