Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `is_already_stairs` will remain True, and `j` will be equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` in the range `0` to `i`. If any element in the array `arr[start_index + j]` does not match the value of `j`, `is_already_stairs` is set to `False`. Since the loop continues as long as `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j` for all `j` from `0` to `i`, if the loop completes all its iterations without setting `is_already_stairs` to `False`, it means that all elements in the specified range of the array satisfy the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j`. Therefore, `is_already_stairs` remains `True` after the loop finishes, and `j` will be equal to `i` since the loop increments `j` up to `i`.
