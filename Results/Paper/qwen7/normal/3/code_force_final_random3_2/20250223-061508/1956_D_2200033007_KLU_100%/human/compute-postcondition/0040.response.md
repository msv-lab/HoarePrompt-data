Output State: **`i` is greater than 0; `start_index` and `i` define a valid range; `j` is `start_index + i + 1`; the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `make_stairs(i - 1)` is a function call that does not directly modify the variables `i`, `start_index`, `j`, or the array `arr`. It only affects the call stack by making a recursive call with `i - 1`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `start_index`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, but its outcome is not specified in the given information.
