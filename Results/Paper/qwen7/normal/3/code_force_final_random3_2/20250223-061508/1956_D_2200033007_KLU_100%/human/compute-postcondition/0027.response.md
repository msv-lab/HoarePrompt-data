Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` equals `i`, and `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called.**

This means that the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with the argument `i - 1`, while the variables `is_already_stairs` and `j` retain their original values from the initial state. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, and the element at index `start_index + i` in the list `arr` is equal to `i`.
