Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True
   - `j` is 1
   - `i` must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` becomes False.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - Since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `i`, and `j` is already 1, the loop will check the condition for `j = 1`.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition to check is `arr[start_index + j] != j`.
   - Given `j = 1`, the condition becomes `arr[start_index + 1] != 1`.

6. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If `arr[start_index + 1] == 1`, then `is_already_stairs` remains True.
   - If `arr[start_index + 1] != 1`, then `is_already_stairs` becomes False.

7. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 (since it starts from 0).
   - Therefore, the loop will check the condition for `j = 2`.

8. **Adjusting States:**
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True if `arr[start_index + 1] == 1`.
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `i` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `is_already_stairs` remains True (assuming `arr[start_index + 1] == 1`).
- `j` is 2.
- `i` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` must be greater than 0**.
