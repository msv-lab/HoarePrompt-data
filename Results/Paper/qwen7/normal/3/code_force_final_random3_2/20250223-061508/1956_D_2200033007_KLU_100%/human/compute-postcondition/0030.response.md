Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` equals `i`, the value of `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as an argument. This function call does not modify the values of `is_already_stairs`, `j`, `i`, or `arr[start_index + i]`. Therefore, these variables retain their original conditions as specified in the initial state.
