Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` will remain True, and `j` will be equal to `i`. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, then `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and `start_index` and `i` define a valid range, `j` is set to `start_index + i + 1` and `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.
