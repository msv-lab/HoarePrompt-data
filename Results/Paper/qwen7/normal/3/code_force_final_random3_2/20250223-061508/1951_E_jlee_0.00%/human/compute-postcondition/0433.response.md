Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `j` and `n` are integers, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. And `count2` is not equal to `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count2` remains unchanged.**
