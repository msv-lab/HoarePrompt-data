Postcondition: `done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is between `0` and `count` (exclusive), we continue the most internal loop or if statement unless `count` is greater than `1`, in which case we break out of it. Additionally, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is false, `count2` is incremented by 1.
