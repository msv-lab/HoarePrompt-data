Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` remains the same, `count2` remains the same, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes us to exit the innermost loop or if statement without changing the values of `s`, `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2`.
