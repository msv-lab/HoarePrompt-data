Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` does not change the value of `done`, so it remains `True`. It also does not affect the value of `count`, which was either `j` or `j + 1` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for `done` and `count` as the initial state.
