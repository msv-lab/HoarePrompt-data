Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, we break out of the most internal loop or statement. Otherwise, if `count2 <= count` and `count <= 1`, we continue the loop or statement we were inside.
