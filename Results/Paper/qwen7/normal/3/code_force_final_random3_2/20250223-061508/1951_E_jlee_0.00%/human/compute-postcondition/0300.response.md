Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`, indicating that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `count` is `j`, meaning that `count` holds the value of `j`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Here, `string[:j]` represents the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`, and `string[j:]` represents the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
Output: **substring of string from start to j-1, followed by substring of string from j to the end**
