You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: All iterations of the loop have completed, with `i` being equal to `t`, `done` is True, `count` and `count2` remaining as their final values from the last iteration, `string` is the last input string processed, `s` is a list representation of `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, and `x` is the first character of `string`. The loop has processed all input strings up to the `t`th string, and for each string, it determined whether the string meets certain conditions and printed the result accordingly.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - It checks if the length of the string `n` is 1. If so, it prints "NO" because a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Non-Palindromic First and Last Characters:**
   - If the first and last characters are different (`x != s[-1]`), it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - This is also correct because a string with different first and last characters is inherently non-palindromic.

4. **String Consisting of a Single Character:**
   - If the string consists entirely of the same character (`s.count(x) == n`), it prints "NO".
   - This is correct because such a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **String with Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If the string has almost all characters the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), it further checks if the remaining character is at the center of the string.
     - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - This logic is correct for the specific condition mentioned.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program then iterates through the string to find a non-palindromic pair of characters.
     - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the string split at that point.
     - If no such pair is found after checking up to the middle of the string, it prints "NO".
   - This part of the logic seems to handle most cases but may miss some edge cases.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic substrings.
- It assumes that finding a single non-palindromic pair will suffice, which might not always be true (e.g., "ababa" should be split into "a", "b", "a", "b", "a").
- The program does not consider all possible valid partitions, especially for longer strings.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not fully address the problem requirements. While it handles some basic cases correctly, it fails to provide all possible valid partitions and does not cover all edge cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
