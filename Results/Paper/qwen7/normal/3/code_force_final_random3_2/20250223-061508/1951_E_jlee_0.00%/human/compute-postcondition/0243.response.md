Postcondition: `count2` is equal to `count`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` must be at least 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the new input string, the current value of `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
