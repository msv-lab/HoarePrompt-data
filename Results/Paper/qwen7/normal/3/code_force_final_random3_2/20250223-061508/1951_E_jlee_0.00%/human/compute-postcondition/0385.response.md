Postcondition: `done` is still False, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`, `count2` is either 0, `j + 1`, or does not exceed `count`, `i` is 3, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list containing the characters of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is the final value it reached during the last iteration of the loop, and `t` must be greater than 2; if the count of `x` in the list `s` is equal to `n` or `n - 1`, the loop continues.
