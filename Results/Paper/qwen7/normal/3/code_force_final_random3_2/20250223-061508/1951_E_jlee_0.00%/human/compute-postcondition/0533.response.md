Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` meets specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. If the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is a palindrome and the second part is a single non-matching character, it also prints the indices indicating the split. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
