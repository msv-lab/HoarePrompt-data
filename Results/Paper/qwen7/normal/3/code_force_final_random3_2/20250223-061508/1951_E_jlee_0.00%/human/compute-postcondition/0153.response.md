Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `string` is an input string (though its specific value is not given, it doesn't affect the print statement directly)
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string
- `n` is `1`
- `x` is the first character of the input string
- `count` is updated to `j`, where `j` is `1`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `j` is `1`

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This statement will print the integer `2` regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **2**
