Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `count` is `j + 1`
- `count2` is either `0`, `j + 2`, or does not exceed `count`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `done`, `count`, and `count2`.

Output: **YES**
