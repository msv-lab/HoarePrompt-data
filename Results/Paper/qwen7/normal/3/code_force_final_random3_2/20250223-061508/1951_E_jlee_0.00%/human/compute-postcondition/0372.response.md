Output State: **`done` is still False, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`, `count2` is either 0, `j + 1`, or does not exceed `count`, `i` is 3, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list containing the characters of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is the final value it reached during the last iteration of the loop, and `t` must be greater than 2; the loop continues.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.
