Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same, `done` is True, `count` remains the same, and `count2` remains the same. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
