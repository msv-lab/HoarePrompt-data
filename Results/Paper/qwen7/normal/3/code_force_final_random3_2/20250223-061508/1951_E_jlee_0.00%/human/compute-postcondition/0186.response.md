Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s.`

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the execution of the if-else block, where the `done` variable is set to `False` regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.
