Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `done` is True.
- `count` remains the same.
- `count2` remains the same.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
