Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` and `n` are integers, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, then `count2` becomes 0 or remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is `count + 1`.
