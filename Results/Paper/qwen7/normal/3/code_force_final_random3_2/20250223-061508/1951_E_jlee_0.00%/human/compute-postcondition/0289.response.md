Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- `count` is `j`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` and there are no variables being referenced within the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
