Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is -1
   - `i` is 2
   - `lsum` is 2
   - `left` is `S[2][0]`
   - `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - 2`

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Other States:**
   - `ans`, `lsum`, `left`, `right`, and `rsum` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 3, `lsum` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`**
