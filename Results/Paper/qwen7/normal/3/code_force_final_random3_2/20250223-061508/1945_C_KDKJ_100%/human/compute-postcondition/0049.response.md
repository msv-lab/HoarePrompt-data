Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 2, `lsum` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `ans`, `i`, `lsum`, `left`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all these variables with their original values.
