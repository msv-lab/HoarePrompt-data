Output State: **`func_1()` has been called again.**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called, which means `func_1()` has been called once already (from the initial state). Calling `func_1()` again does not change the fact that it has been called, but it does indicate that the function is being called a second time. Therefore, the only change is that `func_1()` has been called, and this is now true twice. However, since no specific details about what `func_1()` does are provided, we can only conclude that it has been called again.
