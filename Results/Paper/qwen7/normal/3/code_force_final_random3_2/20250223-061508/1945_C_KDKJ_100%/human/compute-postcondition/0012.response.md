Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

### Variables in the Loop Head
- `s`: This variable takes the value from the list `a` in each iteration.

### Analysis
- At the end of the previous iteration, `s` was set to the current element from the list `a`.
- For the next iteration, `s` will take the next element from the list `a`.

### Adjusting the State
- We need to update the state such that `s` is now the next element from the list `a`.

### Updated State
- Since `s` is the next element from the list `a`, the sublist in `S` will change accordingly based on the value of `s`.

#### Example:
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `s` was '0' and `S` was updated to `[1, 0]`.
- For the next iteration, `s` will be the next element from `a`.

### Final State
- The state needs to reflect that `s` is now the next element from the list `a`.

### Answer
State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise, where `s` is the next element from the list `a`.**

In a more concrete form:
- If the next element in `a` is '0', then `S` will be `[1, 0]`.
- If the next element in `a` is any other value (e.g., '1'), then `S` will be `[0, 1]`.

Thus, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise, where `s` is the next element from the list `a`.**
