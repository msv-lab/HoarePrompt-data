Output State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise; `x` is `last_element_of_S + 2`; `y` is `last_element_of_S`.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` was initially set to `last_element_of_S + 1`, after the increment, `x` becomes `last_element_of_S + 2`. The values of `S`, `s`, and `y` remain unchanged from the initial state.
