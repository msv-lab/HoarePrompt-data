Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `lsum` is 0, `rsum` is `n - 0`.**

Explanation: The variable `rsum` is assigned the value of `n - i`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the value of `rsum` becomes `n - 0`, which simplifies to `n`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `lsum`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial states.
