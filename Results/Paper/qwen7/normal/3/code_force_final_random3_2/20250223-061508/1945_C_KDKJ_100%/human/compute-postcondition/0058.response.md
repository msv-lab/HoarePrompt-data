Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 3, `lsum` is 3, `left` is `S[3][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[3][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `right` to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `right` becomes `S[-1][1] - S[3][1]`. The other variables (`ans`, `lsum`, `left`, and `rsum`) remain unchanged.
