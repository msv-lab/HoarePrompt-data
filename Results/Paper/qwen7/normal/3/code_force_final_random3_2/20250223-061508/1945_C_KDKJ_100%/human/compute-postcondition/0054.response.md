Postcondition: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 2, `lsum` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no else part.**
