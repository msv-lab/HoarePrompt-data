Output State: The function `func_1()` has been called a total of `n` times.

Explanation: Given that the loop runs `int(input())` times and based on the provided output states, it's clear that `func_1()` is called once per iteration of the loop. Since no specific value for `n` or any upper limit for the input to `int(input())` is given other than the range `3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, we can conclude that the loop will execute exactly `n` times, where `n` is the integer input provided. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `func_1()` will have been called a total of `n` times.
