Output State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise.**

This means that the list `S` has been updated by appending a new sublist `[x, y]` to it, where `x` and `y` are determined based on the value of `s`. If `s` is '0', `x` is the last element of `S` plus 1 and `y` is the last element of `S`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `S` and `y` is the last element of `S` plus 1.
