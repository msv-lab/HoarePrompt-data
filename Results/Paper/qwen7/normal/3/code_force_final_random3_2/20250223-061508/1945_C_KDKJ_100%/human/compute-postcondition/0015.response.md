Output State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise; `x` is `last_element_of_S + 1`; `y` is `last_element_of_S + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Initially, `y` was equal to `last_element_of_S`. After executing the code, `y` is now equal to `last_element_of_S + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
