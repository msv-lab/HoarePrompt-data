Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains some logical errors. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`.
3. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES' (which is correct).
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' (which is incorrect because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves).
   - If `b` is even and `c` is even, or `b` is odd and `c` is odd, it prints 'Yes' (which is correct because the parity of `b` and `c` must match).
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No' (which is correct).

However, there is a mistake in the condition checking. Specifically, the condition `elif b < c:` should be handled separately and correctly. The correct logic should be:
- If `b` equals `c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b` is less than `c`, print 'NO'.
- If the parity of `b` and `c` matches, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

The current implementation incorrectly handles the case when `b < c`.

Correctness: **False**
