Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2.

The key point here is the print statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any dependence on the values of other variables. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
