Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the variables involved in the `print` statement:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `b` and `c` are equal, so their values are the same.
- The condition about `b` and `c` being equal means that if `b` is less than `c`, it would contradict the equality, and if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the modulo condition is satisfied.

Since `b` and `c` are equal, the `print('No')` statement will simply print the string "No" without any dependency on the values of `b` and `c`.

Output: **No**
