Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer entered, `c` is the second integer entered, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

Explanation: The line `q = b, c` creates a tuple `q` that contains the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
