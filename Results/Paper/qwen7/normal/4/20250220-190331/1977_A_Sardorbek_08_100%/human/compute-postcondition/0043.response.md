Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `a` is an input integer; `i` is 3; `b` is the first input integer; `c` is the second input integer; `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. The if condition and the else condition simply restate the same variables and their relationships without making any modifications.
