Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `b` is equal to `c` if the input integers for `b` and `c` are the same, otherwise `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`, and if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2.**

This output state reflects that the values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `b` and `c` are now determined by the inputs, and the condition involving `b` and `c` is updated accordingly.
