Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not impossible to have more cubes than moves; it just means that the number of cubes cannot be greater than the number of moves without removing cubes, which is not allowed.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is also incorrect because it does not fully cover all scenarios where it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. For example, if `b = 3` and `c = 1`, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` would fail, but it's still possible to achieve this by adding one cube and then removing two cubes.
   - The default case prints 'No', which is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible valid scenarios.

### Correct Conditions:
- To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to check:
  - If `b >= c`: It's always possible to end up with `c` cubes by adding `c` cubes and possibly removing excess cubes.
  - If `b < c`: It's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the conditions. The corrected program should be as shown above.

**Correctness: False**
