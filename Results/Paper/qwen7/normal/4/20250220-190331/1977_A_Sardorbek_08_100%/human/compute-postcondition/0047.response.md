Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases (t), and for each test case, it processes two integers (n and m). It returns different outputs based on the values of n and m for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves processing two integers (n and m). The function does not take any parameters itself but seems to operate within a loop that runs t times, processing n and m for each iteration, and returning results accordingly. However, based solely on the provided information, the exact nature of the return values for each test case is not specified.
