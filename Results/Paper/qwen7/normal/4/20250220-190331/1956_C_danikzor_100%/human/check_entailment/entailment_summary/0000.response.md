Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix \( a \) using up to \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided program does not actually perform any of the required operations to achieve the maximum sum. Instead, it prints a fixed formula \( n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6 \) and always uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, regardless of the value of \( n \).
3. The operations printed in the program are identical for every row and column, which means they do not change the values in the matrix to maximize the sum as required by the problem statement.
4. The problem specifies that the maximum possible sum can be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations, but the program does not attempt to achieve this sum through the specified operations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it neither calculates the correct maximum sum nor performs the necessary operations to achieve it.

Correctness: **False**
