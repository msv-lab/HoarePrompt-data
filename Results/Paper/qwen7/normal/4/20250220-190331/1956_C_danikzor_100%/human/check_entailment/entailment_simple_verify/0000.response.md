### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} \).
- We can perform up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation either permutes the rows or columns.
- The correct approach involves setting the diagonal elements to the highest possible values and ensuring the off-diagonal elements are set appropriately to maximize the sum.

#### Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` is called `t` times, once for each test case.
- For each test case, `n` is read from input.
- The function prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required.
- Two operations are performed for each row \( i \):
  1. A Type 1 operation sets \( a_{i, j} := n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \).
  2. A Type 2 operation sets \( a_{j, i} := n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \).

Let's verify if these operations indeed maximize the sum.

#### Verification:
1. **Type 1 Operation:**
   - Sets the \( i \)-th row to \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - Sum of the \( i \)-th row: \( n + (n-1) + \cdots + 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Type 2 Operation:**
   - Sets the \( i \)-th column to \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - Sum of the \( i \)-th column: \( n + (n-1) + \cdots + 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

Since both the row and column sums are maximized, the total sum of the matrix is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right) = n \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}. \]

However, the provided code calculates the maximum sum using the formula:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) // 6. \]

Let's check if this formula is correct:
- For \( n = 1 \): \( \frac{1^2(1+1)}{2} = 1 \) and \( 1 \cdot (1 + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot 1 - 1) // 6 = 1 \).
- For \( n = 2 \): \( \frac{2^2(2+1)}{2} = 6 \) and \( 2 \cdot (2 + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \).

The formula seems to be incorrect for \( n = 2 \) as the expected maximum sum is 8, not 7.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and the operations do not ensure the maximum sum is achieved. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
