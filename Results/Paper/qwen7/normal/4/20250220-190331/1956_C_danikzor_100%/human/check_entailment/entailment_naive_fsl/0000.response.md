Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as described in the problem statement. The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. Additionally, the operations performed in the `func_1` function do not change the values in the matrix in a way that would maximize the sum.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple 2x2 matrix. According to the problem, the maximum sum should be achievable using at most 4 operations (2n for n=2). However, the current implementation sets each element in the matrix to a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.

For a 2x2 matrix, the correct approach would involve setting the diagonal elements to the highest possible values and ensuring the off-diagonal elements are set appropriately to maximize the sum. The given implementation does not achieve this.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `2`
- Expected output for a 2x2 matrix:
  ```
  8 4
  1 1 2
  1 2 1
  2 1 2
  2 2 1
  ```
- Actual output from the given program:
  ```
  7 4
  1 1 2
  1 2 1
  2 1 2
  2 2 1
  ```

The actual output sum is 7, which is less than the expected maximum sum of 8. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
