Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 3.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the final value of `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`, so when the loop ends, `i` will have reached `n`. Given that the loop must execute at least 3 times, `n` must be at least 3. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
