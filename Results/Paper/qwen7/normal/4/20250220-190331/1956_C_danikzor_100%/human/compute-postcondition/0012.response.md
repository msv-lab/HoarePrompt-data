Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the final value of `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `n` must be at least 3 since the loop was able to execute 3 times, meaning `n` was initially at least 3 or more.
