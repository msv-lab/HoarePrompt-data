Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Output Calculation**: The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the count `2 * n` are derived from the problem statement. The formula represents the maximum possible sum of the matrix after performing the operations, and `2 * n` represents the maximum number of operations allowed. This part is correct.
3. **Operations Execution**:
   - For each test case, the program performs `2 * n` operations, which is within the limit specified.
   - Each operation is of type 1 or 2, and the permutations used are correct (i.e., they are permutations of integers from 1 to `n`).
   - The permutations used are `range(n, 0, -1)`, which means the elements are set in reverse order. This is a valid permutation and will maximize the sum of the matrix.
4. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `1` to `n`, ensuring that each row and column is processed exactly once for each type of operation.
5. **Final State**: The state after the loop indicates that `i` will be equal to `n`, and `t` remains unchanged. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
