Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of length equal to the maximum value in `d`'s keys containing only 0s and 1s, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers initialized to 0s. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the updated value of `rank[da - 1]` and all elements in `processing` are set to 0.**
