Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only object here is `func_10()`, which returns an integer value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`. We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer, as the loop will run for that many iterations. Additionally, we need to ensure that the initial state of `t` (which is given) is consistent with the constraints provided.

3. **Constraints and initial state**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

Since the loop's execution depends on the return value of `func_10()`, and there are no direct references to `t`, `n`, or `m` in the loop head, the only state that needs adjustment is related to the loop itself. Specifically, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**State:**
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Given the constraints, the most straightforward way to ensure the loop executes is to assume `func_10()` returns a value within a reasonable range (since \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can assume `func_10()` returns a value between 1 and 10^4).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**.
