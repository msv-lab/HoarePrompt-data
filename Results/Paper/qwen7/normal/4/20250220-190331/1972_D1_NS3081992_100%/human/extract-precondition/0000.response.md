Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.** 

Explanation: Based on the program provided, we understand that there is a loop running `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Within each iteration, the function `func_15()` is called and its output is written to standard output followed by a newline character. The function `func_10()` is called to determine the value of `t`. Therefore, the precondition includes the constraints on `t`, and for each test case, it includes the constraints on `n` and `m`.
