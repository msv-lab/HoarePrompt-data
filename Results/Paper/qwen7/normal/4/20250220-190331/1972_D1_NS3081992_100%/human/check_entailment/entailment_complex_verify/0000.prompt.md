You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and updates the integer `k` based on the values in `a` compared to `m`. If `k` is non-negative after processing all elements in `a`, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

    #
    #To explain this output state in natural language:
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will either be greater than `m` or `i * i` will be greater than `n + i`. The variable `n` remains a positive integer, and `m` remains a positive integer. The variable `ans` contains the cumulative sum of the expression `(n + j) // (j * j)` for each `j` starting from 2 up to the final value of `i` that satisfies the loop condition.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all `j` from 2 to the final value of `i` that satisfies `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`, minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all integers \(j\) from 2 to the largest integer \(i\) such that \(i \leq m\) and \(i * i \leq n + i\), minus 1.

For each iteration, `func_15()` will return a positive integer, which will be written to the standard output followed by a newline character. After all iterations, the standard output will contain each positive integer returned by `func_15()` on a new line, with the number of lines being equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
    #
    #This means that if `func_10()` returns a value `k`, then the standard output will consist of `k` lines, each containing a positive integer as returned by `func_15()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an unspecified number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations. Then, for each iteration, it calls `func_15()` to get a positive integer, which is printed to the standard output followed by a newline. After processing all test cases, the standard output contains multiple lines, each with a positive integer generated by `func_15()`, with the number of lines corresponding to the sum of the values returned by `func_10()` across all test cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the functions defined in the program do not address this specific logic.

The functions defined (such as `func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input but do not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. There is no function that implements the core algorithm to count the valid pairs based on the given conditions.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Since the provided code does not include this logic, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
