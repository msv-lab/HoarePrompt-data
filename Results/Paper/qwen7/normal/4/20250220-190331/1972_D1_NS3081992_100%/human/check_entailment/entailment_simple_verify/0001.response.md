### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_15` does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses an incorrect loop condition and does not account for the necessary checks.

The original assessment suggests a corrected approach, which involves iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This approach is indeed correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis and the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is incorrect, and the original assessment correctly identified this issue.
