### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem. The functions defined in the program are primarily for reading input and do not contain the logic to count the valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Reading Functions**: The functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are designed to read input from the standard input. While these functions are correctly implemented for their purpose, they do not contribute to solving the problem directly.

2. **Problem-Specific Logic**: The problem requires counting pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). No function in the provided code implements this logic.

3. **Function `func_15`**: Although `func_15` is defined, it does not solve the problem. Instead, it calculates a sum related to the input values \(n\) and \(m\), but it does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Function `func_16`**: This function iterates over the test cases and calls `func_15` for each case. Since `func_15` does not solve the problem, `func_16` also does not solve the problem.

Given that the provided code lacks the essential logic to solve the problem and instead contains unrelated utility functions, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem.
