Output State: **`func_15()` returns a positive integer**.

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_15()` to the standard output as a string. Since the initial state requires `func_15()` to return a positive integer, and the code does not change the behavior of `func_15()`, the output state remains that `func_15()` returns a positive integer. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
