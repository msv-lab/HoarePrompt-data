Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_15` attempts to count pairs using a loop where it checks if \(i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\). This logic does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic required to correctly count the pairs based on the given conditions is missing. The provided solution does not implement the necessary steps to compute the number of valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = func_10()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = func_2()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This approach iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, which ensures correctness.
