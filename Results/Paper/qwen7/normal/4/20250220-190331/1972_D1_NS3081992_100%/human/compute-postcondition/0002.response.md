Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `func_15()` returns a positive integer.
- The loop statement is: `for _ in range(func_10()):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a placeholder indicating that the value of the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
   - The loop condition is determined by `func_10()`.
   
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `func_15()` returned a positive integer. This means `func_10()` must have returned a positive integer as well.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` still returns a positive integer for the next iteration.
   - The state does not change for the loop variable `_` because it is a placeholder.
   - We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`, ensuring it still returns a positive integer for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer**
