Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` are designed to read input from standard input and handle it differently. However, the primary functions needed for solving the problem are `func_4()`, `func_7()`, and `func_15()`.
   - `func_4()` reads multiple test cases and returns a list of tuples containing `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - `func_7()` reads a single line of space-separated integers.
   - `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs for a given `n` and `m` based on the problem statement.

2. **Core Functionality**:
   - `func_15()` is the core function that implements the logic to count valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic in `func_15()` iterates through possible values of `i` and counts how many valid pairs exist for each `i` up to `m`.

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires reading multiple test cases, each with `n` and `m`, and printing the count of valid pairs for each test case.
   - The solution correctly uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases and `func_15()` to compute the result for each test case.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The function `func_16()` correctly processes each test case by calling `func_10()` to get the number of iterations and then calling `func_15()` for each iteration, printing the result for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
