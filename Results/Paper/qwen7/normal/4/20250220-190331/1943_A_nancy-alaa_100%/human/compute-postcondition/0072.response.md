Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be `1`, and there is no operation that would change the value of `i` within the scope of the given conditions, the value of `i` remains `1`.

Output: **1**
