Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `first` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional, if it were inside one. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `first` remain as they were in the initial state.
