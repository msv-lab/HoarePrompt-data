Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
