Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

The variable `first` is set to `False`, which means it now holds the boolean value `False`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
