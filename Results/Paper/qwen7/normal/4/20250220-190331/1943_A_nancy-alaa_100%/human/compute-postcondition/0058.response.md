Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`
- The value of `mpp[i]` is `1`
- `first` is `True`

The code snippet is simply printing the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is explicitly stated to be `0`, the print statement will output this value directly.

Output: **0**
