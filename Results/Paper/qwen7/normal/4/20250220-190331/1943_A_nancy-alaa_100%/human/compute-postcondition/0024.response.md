Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`, meaning it was either never set to `True` or was reset to `False` after being set to `True`.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`, but its exact value is not specified.
- There is a condition that if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `i` is `1`, and no specific `mpp` dictionary is given, we assume that `1` is not a key in `mpp`, leading to a break.

Given this information, the print statement `print(i)` will simply print the value of `i`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
