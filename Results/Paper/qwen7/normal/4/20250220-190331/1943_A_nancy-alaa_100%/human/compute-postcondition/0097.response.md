Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, which starts from 0 in most programming languages when using `range(n + 1)`.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` is already stated as a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `first` is False (this is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` is a positive integer (no change needed).
   - `arr` is a list of integers (no change needed).
   - `mpp` is a Counter object (no change needed).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` being set to 0.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
