Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user using `input()`. The `split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The `map(int, ...)` function applies the `int` function to each substring, converting them into integers. The result is stored in the list `arr`. The variables `first` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
