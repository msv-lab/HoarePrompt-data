Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `first` is `False`.
   - If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n + 1)`, meaning `i` ranges from 0 to `n`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `first` is `False` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Conditions for Breaking Out of the Loop:**
   - If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the loop will break.
   - If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`, the loop will break.

Given these conditions, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1` (since it was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` remains the same.
- `first` is `False` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `first` is `False`**.
