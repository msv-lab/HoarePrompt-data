Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` does not contain the element `a[r]`, `extra` does not change, `done` contains the element `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`, these relationships remain unchanged. Additionally, since `todo` does not contain the element `a[r]` and `extra` does not change, those conditions also remain the same. The only change is that `done` now includes the element `a[r]`.
