Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, if `a[r]` is in the `todo` list, then `todo` list will have the element `a[r]` removed, and `done` set will now contain the element `a[r]`; otherwise, `extra` list will now contain the element `a[r]`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, `r` has been updated to `m + 2`, and `old` has been set to the value of `a[r - m]`. Additionally, depending on whether `a[r]` is present in the `todo` list, the `todo` list will either have `a[r]` removed and `a[r]` added to the `done` set, or `a[r]` will be added to the `extra` list.
