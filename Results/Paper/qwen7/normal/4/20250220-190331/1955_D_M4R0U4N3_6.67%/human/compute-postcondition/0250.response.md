Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` has had the element `a[r - m]` removed, `done` remains unchanged, and `extra` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the `todo` list. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, `extra`, and `done` remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
