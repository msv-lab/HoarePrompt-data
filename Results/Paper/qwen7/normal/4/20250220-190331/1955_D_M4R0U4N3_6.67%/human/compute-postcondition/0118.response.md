Output State: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains all elements `a[j]` that were in `todo`, `extra` contains all elements `a[j]` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `todo` will contain all the integers that were initially present but not moved to `done`. `done` will contain all the integers that were successfully moved from `todo` to `done` during the loop's execution. `extra` will contain all the integers that were not in `todo` and thus added to `extra`. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, otherwise it will be 0. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will retain their initial values, and `m` will still be greater than 0.
