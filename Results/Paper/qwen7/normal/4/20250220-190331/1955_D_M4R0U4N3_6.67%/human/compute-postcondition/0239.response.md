Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`; if `a[r]` is in `done`, then `len(done)` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is increased by 1; if `a[r]` is in `extra`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `old` is not in `extra`, and `ans` is increased by 1.
