Output State: **`r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is in `todo`, `old` is in `done` but has been removed from `done`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.add(old)` adds the variable `old` to the set `todo`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `old` was previously in `done` but removed, it is now added to `todo`.
