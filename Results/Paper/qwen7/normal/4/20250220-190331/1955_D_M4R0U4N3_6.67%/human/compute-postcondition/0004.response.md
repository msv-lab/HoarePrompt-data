Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `done`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `todo` remain unchanged from their initial states.
