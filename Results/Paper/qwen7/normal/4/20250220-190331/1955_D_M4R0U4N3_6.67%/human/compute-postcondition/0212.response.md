Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for r in range(m, n)`. The variables involved here are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is equal to `m-1`, but `j` is not part of the loop head, so we don't need to adjust its state.
   - `ans` is determined based on the length of `done` relative to `k`, but `ans` is not part of the loop head either.
   - `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are lists, but their contents are not directly relevant to the loop condition.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `m <= r < n`. Therefore, the initial value of `r` should be `m`, and the values of `m` and `n` should be such that the loop can start and continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `r` should be initialized to `m` because the loop starts with `r = m`.
   - `m` and `n` should be set such that `m <= r < n` holds true for the first iteration.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than `m`**
