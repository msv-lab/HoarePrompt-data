Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine how many subsegments of array `a` of length `m` are "good" according to the given definition. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes variables and sets for tracking elements (`todo`, `done`, `extra`) and reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.
   
2. **Initial Processing**:
   - The initial segment of the loop processes the first `m` elements of `a` to populate the sets `todo` and `done` based on whether they match any element in `b`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The main loop uses a sliding window approach to process the remaining elements of `a` from index `m` to `n-1`. For each new element entering the window, it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
   - Specifically, it handles the removal of the element that is sliding out of the window and the addition of the new element entering the window.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` after each update. If so, it increments the answer counter `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the final count of good subsegments for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly counts the number of good subsegments for each test case. The use of sets ensures efficient management of elements and their transitions between `todo`, `done`, and `extra`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
