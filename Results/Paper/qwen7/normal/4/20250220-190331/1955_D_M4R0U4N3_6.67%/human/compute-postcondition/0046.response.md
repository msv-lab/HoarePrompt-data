Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`, `old` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is in `done`, `a[r]` is not in `todo`**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `a[r]` was not previously in `done`, it gets added. Additionally, since `a[r]` was already stated to be not in `todo`, its state remains unchanged. The value of `old` and its relationships with other variables also remain unchanged.
