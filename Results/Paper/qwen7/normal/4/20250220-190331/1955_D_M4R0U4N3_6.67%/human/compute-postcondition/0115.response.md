Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input with `a[j]` removed, `done` now contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `j_prev + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `done` has been updated to include `a[j]` if `a[j]` was present in `todo`. The variable `extra` remains unchanged unless `a[j]` was not in `todo`, in which case it would contain `a[j]`. The value of `ans` remains the same based on the current length of `done` compared to `k`. All other variables retain their initial states.
