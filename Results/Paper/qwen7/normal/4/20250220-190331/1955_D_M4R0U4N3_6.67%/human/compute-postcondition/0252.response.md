Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `extra` contains `a[r]`, if `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain `old`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo` and `done` has had the element `old` removed. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes are made to `todo` and `done`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The conditions involving `old` (whether it is in `extra` or `done`) remain unchanged because `a[r]` is not necessarily equal to `a[r - m]`. Therefore, the state of `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remains as per the initial postconditions, except that `extra` now includes `a[r]`.
