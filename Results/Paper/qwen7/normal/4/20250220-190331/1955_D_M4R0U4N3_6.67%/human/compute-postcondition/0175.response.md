Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `todo` list has the element `a[r]` removed, `done` set now contains the element `a[r]`.**

This means that after executing the line `done.add(a[r])`, the `done` set has been updated to include the element `a[r]`, while the other variables retain their previous states.
