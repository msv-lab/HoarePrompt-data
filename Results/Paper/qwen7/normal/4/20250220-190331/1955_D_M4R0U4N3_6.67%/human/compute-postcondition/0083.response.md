Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, `extra` includes `a[m + 2]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`. If `old` is not in `extra`, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` is removed from the `done` set. If `old` is in the `done` set, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` remains in the `done` set.**

This output state reflects the changes made by adding `a[r]` to the `extra` set, while keeping the other conditions and relationships intact.
