Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split excluding `a[j]`, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[2]`, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` (which is 2) of the list `a` to the set `done`. Initially, `done` contains either `a[0]` or an empty set. After adding `a[2]`, `done` now contains both `a[0]` and `a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
