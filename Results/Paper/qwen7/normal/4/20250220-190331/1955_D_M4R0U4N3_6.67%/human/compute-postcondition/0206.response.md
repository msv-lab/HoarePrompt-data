Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is greater than 0; `a[j]` is not in the list `todo`; `done` contains the element `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is 2, `a[j]` is added to `done`. Also, since `a[j]` was removed from the list `todo`, it is no longer in `todo`. The other variables remain unchanged.
