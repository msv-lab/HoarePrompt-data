Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input, `m` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains the element `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `done` is updated by adding `a[j]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains the element `a[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `j_prev + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
