Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[1]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is initially 1, `extra` now contains `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
