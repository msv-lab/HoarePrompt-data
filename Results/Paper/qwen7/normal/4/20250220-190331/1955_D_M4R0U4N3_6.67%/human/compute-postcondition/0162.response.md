Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 1`, and `old` is either removed from the `extra` list or added to the `todo` set. `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, `r` has been updated to `m + 1`, and `old` is either removed from the `extra` list or added to the `todo` set. The `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain unchanged from their state at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of the `done` list is still greater than or equal to `k`.
