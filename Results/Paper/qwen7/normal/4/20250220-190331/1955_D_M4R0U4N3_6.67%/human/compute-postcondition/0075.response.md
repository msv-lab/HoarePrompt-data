Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, `todo` will depend on the condition mentioned, and `old` is removed from the `done` set.**

Explanation: The line `done.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their previous states.
