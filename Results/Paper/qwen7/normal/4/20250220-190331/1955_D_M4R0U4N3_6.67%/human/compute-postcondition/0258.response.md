Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `old` is the value of `a[r - m]` which is `a[m + 2 - m]` or `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Given that `r` is `m + 2`, `r - m` simplifies to `2`. Therefore, `old` is set to the value of `a[2]`. The values of `r`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
