Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `extra` has had the element `a[2]` removed.**

Explanation: The variable `r` was initially defined as `m + 2`. The condition `m <= n` and `n > m` remains unchanged. The variable `old` was previously set to `a[r - m]`, which simplifies to `a[2]`. The line `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `a[2]` from the list `extra`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
