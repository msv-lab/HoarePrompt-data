You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it analyzes a list of integers `a` and determines how many times the count of elements in `done` (elements that satisfy certain conditions) reaches or exceeds a specified threshold `k`. It does this by iterating through the list `a`, managing sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to track elements based on their presence and movement between these sets. The function ultimately outputs the total count of such occurrences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine how many subsegments of array `a` of length `m` are "good" based on the criteria that at least `k` elements in the subsegment must match elements in array `b`.

2. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - For each test case, the program iterates through all possible subsegments of `a` of length `m`.
   - It maintains two sets: `done` (elements from `a` that match elements in `b` and have been seen so far in the current subsegment) and `extra` (elements from `a` that do not match any element in `b`).
   - It also uses a set `todo` which initially contains all elements of `b`.
   - As it processes each new element in the subsegment, it updates the sets `done`, `extra`, and `todo` accordingly.
   - If the size of `done` reaches `k` or more, it increments the answer counter `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the transition from one subsegment to the next by removing the element that is no longer in the current subsegment and adding the new element.
   - It correctly checks if the current subsegment meets the condition of having at least `k` matching elements with `b`.
   - The logic for updating the sets `done`, `extra`, and `todo` ensures that the program accurately tracks the matching elements as it slides through the array `a`.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The program uses sets to efficiently check membership and update counts, which is appropriate given the constraints.
   - The overall complexity is linear with respect to the number of elements in `a` and `b`, making it efficient enough for the given constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of good subsegments.

Correctness: **True**
