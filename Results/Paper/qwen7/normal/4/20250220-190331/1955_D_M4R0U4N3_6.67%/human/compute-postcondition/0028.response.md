Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for r in range(m, n)`. The variables involved here are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know the following initial states:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
   - `todo` is an empty set.
   - `done` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were originally in `todo`.
   - `extra` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were not in `todo`.
   - `m` is equal to the length of the list `a`.
   - `j` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `m-1`).
   - `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for r in range(m, n)` will execute as long as `m <= r < n`. Therefore, the values of `m` and `n` need to be such that the loop can start and continue executing.

4. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop depends on `m` and `n`, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue. The value of `m` is fixed as the length of the list `a`, but `n` is not specified. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `m`.

5. **Final State**: Given the above conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than `m`.

**State:**
**`m` is the length of the list `a`, `n` must be greater than `m`**
