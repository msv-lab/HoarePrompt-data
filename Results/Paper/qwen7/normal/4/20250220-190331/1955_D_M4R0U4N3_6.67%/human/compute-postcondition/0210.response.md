Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `todo` will only contain elements that were never in `a`, `done` will contain elements from `a` that were moved from `todo` to `done`, and `extra` will contain elements from `a` that were never in `todo`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `j` will have reached the value of `m-1`, indicating that the loop has processed each index in the list `a` exactly once. The `todo` set will only include elements that were never found in `a`, as those elements would have been moved to either `done` or `extra`. The `done` set will contain all elements from `a` that were successfully moved from `todo` to `done` during the iterations. Finally, the `extra` set will include all elements from `a` that were not present in `todo` but were found in `a`, thus being added to `extra` during the loop's execution.
