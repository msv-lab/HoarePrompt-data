Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `todo` now contains `old`, and `done` has had the value of `a[2]` removed.**

Explanation: The code `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. The initial conditions for `r`, `m`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged except that `todo` now includes `old`.
