Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `removals`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `removals + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `removals` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is `s - elements[-1]`.
   - `n` is either the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if no `IndexError` occurred, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurred.
   - `pos` is `[s - 2 * n]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `removals` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `removals` remains the same (no information given that it should change).

6. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `s` remains `s - elements[-1]`.
   - `n` remains the updated value if no `IndexError` occurred, or 0 if an `IndexError occurred`.
   - `pos` remains `[s - 2 * n]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `s` is `s - elements[-1]`, `n` is either the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if no `IndexError` occurred, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n]***
