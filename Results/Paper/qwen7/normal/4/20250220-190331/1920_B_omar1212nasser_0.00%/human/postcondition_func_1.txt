The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3; if true, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the elements (`s`) and the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`n`). It then iterates `removals` times, adjusting `s` and `n` based on the elements being removed and potentially multiplied by -1, and appends the value `s - 2 * n` to a list `pos`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.
