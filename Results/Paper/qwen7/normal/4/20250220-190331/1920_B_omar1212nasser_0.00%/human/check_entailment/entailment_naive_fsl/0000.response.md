Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition that returns 0 if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This hardcoded condition is not based on the problem description and does not account for other possible values of `removals` and `negatives`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
For this case, the program should calculate the optimal sum based on the rules given in the problem description. However, due to the hardcoded condition, the program incorrectly returns 0 instead of the correct value.

The correct approach would involve dynamically calculating the maximum possible sum based on the number of removals and negations allowed, rather than using a hardcoded condition.
