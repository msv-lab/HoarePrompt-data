Output State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-1]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1.
- After executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 2.
- The value of `n` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` to its current value. Given `i` is now 2, this translates to `n += elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]`.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the given code snippet.
- The precondition that `removals` must be a non-negative integer remains valid.
