Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. It reads `n`, `k`, and `x` for each test case, sorts the array `a`, and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to get the result. The result is printed for each test case.
2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function's logic seems flawed. It returns 0 directly when `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, which does not align with the problem's requirements. Additionally, the logic for calculating the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob's moves is incorrect. Specifically, the function should consider the optimal strategy for both players, which involves removing the smallest elements and flipping the largest negative contributions.

Given the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve:
- Alice removing the smallest elements to minimize their impact on the sum.
- Bob multiplying the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.

However, the current implementation in `func_2()` does not reflect this strategy correctly. The function should calculate the sum of the array after considering the best moves by both players, but the current logic does not do so.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because the function `func_2()` does not implement the correct logic for the optimal strategy.

Correctness: **False**
