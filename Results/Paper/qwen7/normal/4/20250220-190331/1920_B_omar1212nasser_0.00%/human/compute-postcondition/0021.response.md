Output State: **`removals` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `n` is the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `n` by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` to the current value of `n`.
- Given that `i` is 3, the expression inside the square brackets for `n` becomes `elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`.
- The values of `removals`, `i`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not directly affected by the operation.
- The updated value of `n` depends on the values of `elements[-(negatives + 3)]` and `elements[-3]`.
