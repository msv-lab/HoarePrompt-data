#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `product` is the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` (the number of test cases) must still be greater than 0. The loop variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `t`. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` will be the integers obtained from the first line of input, `a` will be a sorted list of integers obtained from the second line of input, and `product` will be the result of the function `func_2(k, x, a)` applied to each set of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product based on these inputs. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers. Either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: `removals` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `removals`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the last `removals` elements, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, otherwise `n` is 0, and `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `removals` will be the final number of iterations performed, `i` will be equal to `removals`, `s` will be the initial sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, `n` will be the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` adjusted by subtracting the sum of elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, and `pos` will contain the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3; if true, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the elements (`s`) and the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`n`). It then iterates `removals` times, adjusting `s` and `n` based on the elements being removed and potentially multiplied by -1, and appends the value `s - 2 * n` to a list `pos`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.
