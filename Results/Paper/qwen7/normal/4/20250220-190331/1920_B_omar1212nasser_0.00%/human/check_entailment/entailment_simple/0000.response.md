Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the functions and their states.
2. The `func_1` function reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` for each test case, sorts the array, and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
3. The `func_2` function handles the logic for Alice and Bob's moves:
   - If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0 directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the potential sums of the array after different combinations of removals and negations, storing these in the list `pos`.
   - It then returns the maximum value from this list.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_2` aligns with the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob:
- Alice aims to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements.
- Bob aims to minimize the sum by negating the largest elements.

The program correctly implements this strategy by considering all possible ways Alice can remove elements and Bob can negate elements, and then returning the best possible outcome.

Correctness: **True**
