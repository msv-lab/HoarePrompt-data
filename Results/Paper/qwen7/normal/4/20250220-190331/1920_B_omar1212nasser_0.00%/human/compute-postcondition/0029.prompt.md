You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers. Either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: `removals` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `removals`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the last `removals` elements, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, otherwise `n` is 0, and `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `removals` will be the final number of iterations performed, `i` will be equal to `removals`, `s` will be the initial sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, `n` will be the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` adjusted by subtracting the sum of elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, and `pos` will contain the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value in the list `pos`, where `pos` contains the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value in the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
