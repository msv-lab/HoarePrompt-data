Output State: **`removals` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `n` is the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError`, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` decrements `s` by the value of `elements[-i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so `s` is decremented by `elements[-4]`. After this operation, `i` becomes 3 because it is used as an index in the list `elements`. All other variables remain unchanged unless an `IndexError` occurs, which is not specified to happen in this case.
