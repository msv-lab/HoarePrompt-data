The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product based on these inputs. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
