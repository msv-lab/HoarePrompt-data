Output State: **`k` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `k`, `m`, or `j`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that we know a break occurred.
