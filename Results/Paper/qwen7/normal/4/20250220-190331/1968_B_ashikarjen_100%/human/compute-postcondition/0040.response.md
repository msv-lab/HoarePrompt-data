Output State: **`k` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is `j + 1`, and `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]` for any index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `k`, `m`, and the constraint on `b[j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` remains 0, `m` is still at least 3, `j` is now `j + 1`, and the condition that `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]` for any index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1` still holds.
