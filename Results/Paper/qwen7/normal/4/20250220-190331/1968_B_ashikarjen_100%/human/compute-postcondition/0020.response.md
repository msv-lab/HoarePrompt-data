Postcondition: **`k` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, and `j` is the value of `m + 1`. Alternatively, `k` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, and `j` is the value of `m`. The condition `b[2] != a[i]` remains valid in both cases.**
