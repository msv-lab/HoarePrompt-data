Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `a` is also unchanged from its initial state.
