Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Outcome:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The current implementation checks only a few conditions without considering the full game dynamics. Specifically, it doesn't correctly account for the optimal moves and the ability to force a win.

2. **Misinterpretation of Moves:**
   - The solution incorrectly assumes that the distance between Alice and Bob can directly determine the winner. This is not always true because the players can make strategic moves to block or force a win.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The code does not handle all edge cases where the players can force a win or a draw. For example, when Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row, the game should end in a draw, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Use of Variables:**
   - The variables `l` and `r` are used to calculate the range of possible moves, but the logic for determining whether these moves lead to a win or draw is not correctly implemented.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the outcome, you need to consider the following:

- **Initial Positions:** Check the initial positions of Alice and Bob.
- **Movement Constraints:** Ensure that the movements are within the board boundaries.
- **Optimal Strategy:** Determine if either player can force a win based on the initial positions and the rules of movement.

Here is a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

```python
def determine_outcome(h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb):
    # Alice starts and can move down, down-right, or down-left
    # Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left
    # If Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
    if xa == h and xb == 1:
        return "Draw"
    
    # If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position
    # or vice versa, the player who can reach the other's position first wins
    if xa < xb:
        return "Alice"
    elif xa > xb:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        # If Alice and Bob are in the same row, check the columns
        if ya < yb:
            return "Alice"
        elif ya > yb:
            return "Bob"
        else:
            return "Draw"

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = determine_outcome(r, w, a, b, c, d)
        print(result)

func()
```

This approach correctly handles the game dynamics and determines the outcome based on the initial positions and the rules of movement.
