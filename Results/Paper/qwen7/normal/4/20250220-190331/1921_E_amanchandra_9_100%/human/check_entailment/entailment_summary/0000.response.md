Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Comparison**: The program checks if Alice's initial row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's initial row position (`c`). If this condition is true, it immediately prints "Draw", which is correct because Alice cannot win if she starts below Bob.
3. **Range Calculation for Alice**: When `a` is less than or equal to `c`, the program calculates the range for Alice's potential moves using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`. This calculation is correct for determining the midpoint between Alice and Bob's initial positions.
4. **Range Calculation for Bob**: Similarly, the program calculates the range for Bob's potential moves. This part is also correct.
5. **Win Condition Check**: The program checks if Alice or Bob can force a win based on the calculated ranges. Specifically, it checks if the opponent's column position falls within the calculated range. This logic is correct for determining the winner.
6. **Output Formatting**: The program uses list indexing to format the output string correctly. This is a clever way to handle the conditional print statement without using an `if-else` block.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
