Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` retain their original values.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the square brackets `[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1]` determines which list will be used.
   - If both conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are true, then `['Draw']` will be selected.
   - Otherwise, `['Alice']` will be selected.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected list into individual elements, so the print statement will print either "Draw" or "Alice".

4. **Conditions**:
   - We need to know the values of `l`, `b`, `r`, and `x` to determine which list will be chosen.
   - Since the values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact values of `r` and `abs(r - b)`.
   - However, we can still determine the structure of the output based on the conditions.

Given the structure of the problem and the conditions, the output will be one of the following two strings: "Draw" or "Alice".

Output: **Draw** or **Alice**
