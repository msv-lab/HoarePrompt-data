Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. It checks if the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9 are met, and ensures that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. If these conditions are satisfied, the function does not return anything explicitly; otherwise, it indicates an invalid input.**

This functionality describes a function that receives six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) and verifies specific constraints on these values. If the constraints are met, the function performs no explicit return, implying validation success. If any constraint is violated, the function would indicate an error, though the exact nature of the return in the latter case is not specified in the given information.
