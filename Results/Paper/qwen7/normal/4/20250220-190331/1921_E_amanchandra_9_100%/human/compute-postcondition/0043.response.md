Postcondition: `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether `abs(a - c) % 2` is true or false. `w`, `d`, `x`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `l` retain their initial values, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on the condition.
