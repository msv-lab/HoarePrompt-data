Based on the initial state provided, the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to the values entered by the user. The variable `l` is determined by the following logic:

- If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, then `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
- Otherwise, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`. Since no other variables are involved in this print statement, the output is independent of the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x`.

Output: **Draw**
