Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `r` (height), `w` (width), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if Alice's row position `a` is greater than Bob's row position `c`. 
     - If `a > c`, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Case When Alice is Not in a Higher Row:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program calculates the difference in rows `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - It then checks if this difference is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`).

4. **Odd Difference Case:**
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the possible left and right boundaries for Alice's next move.
   - `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position `b` is within these boundaries.
   - If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`, it prints "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If the difference is even, it calculates similar boundaries but for Bob's next move.
   - `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`.
   - It then checks if Alice's column position `a` is within these boundaries.
   - If `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Verification Against Examples:
The provided examples show various scenarios where the program's logic should work correctly:
- Alice and Bob in different rows with an odd difference (Alice wins).
- Alice and Bob in different rows with an even difference (Bob wins).
- Alice and Bob in the same row (Draw).

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to correctly implement the rules and outcomes as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
