Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not properly account for all possible movements and winning conditions.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
In this case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (5, 3). According to the rules, Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. The program incorrectly checks the positions without fully considering the optimal moves for both players.

The program attempts to calculate the distance between Alice and Bob and then checks if the opponent's position falls within a certain range. However, this approach does not always lead to the correct outcome because it does not simulate the optimal moves for both players.

To correctly determine the outcome, the program needs to simulate the optimal moves for both players and check if either player can force a win. The current implementation does not fully simulate these scenarios, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
