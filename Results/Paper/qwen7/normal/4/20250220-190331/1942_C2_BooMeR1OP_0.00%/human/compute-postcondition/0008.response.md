Output State: **`i` is 0; `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n; `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n**

Explanation: 
- The initial state has `i` set to 0 and `t1` calculated as `(a[0] + 1) % n`.
- The code snippet sets `t2` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[0]`. Therefore, `t2` is calculated as `(a[0] + 2) % n`.
- No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
