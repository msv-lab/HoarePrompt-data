Output State: **`i` is 2; `t1` is (a[2] + 1) % n; `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in `present`; `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is 2, `t1` is now `(a[2] + 1) % n`. The values of `t2`, which is `(a[0] + 2) % n` and is in `present`, and `ans`, which remains 1, are unchanged.
