Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[x % x]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The variable `next_elem` is assigned a value based on the conditions given. If `x` is greater than 1, then `next_elem` is calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + n`, which simplifies to `a[1 % x] + n`. If `x` is 1, then `i % x` is 0, so `next_elem` would be `a[0]`. However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep it as a general condition. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and it is still required to be a positive integer.
