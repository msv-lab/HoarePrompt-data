Output State: **`i` is 3; `t2` is (a[3] + 2) % n; `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value. Given no initial value for `ans` is provided, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `t2` remain unchanged.
