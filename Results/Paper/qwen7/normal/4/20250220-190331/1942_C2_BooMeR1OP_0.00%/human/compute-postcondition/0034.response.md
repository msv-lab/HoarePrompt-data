Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `x` must be a positive integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `x` remains unchanged.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only variables that change within the loop head are `i` and `x`.
   - Since `x` is a positive integer and does not change, we only need to update `i`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be a positive integer**
