You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and returns the sum of certain gaps derived from the input data. Specifically, it counts how many gaps of size 1 or 2 are present between consecutive elements in the list of chosen vertices, and then sums up the remaining gaps after adjusting based on the value of y. If y is insufficient to cover all possible pairs, it uses the available y to maximize the sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Specifically, the logic for counting the gaps and adding triangles based on those gaps is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 2
1 3
```

According to the problem description, with `n=4`, `x=2`, and `y=2`, we need to maximize the number of triangles. The vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 3. We can choose 2 additional vertices. The correct solution should form 2 triangles by choosing vertices 2 and 4.

However, the program's logic for calculating the number of triangles does not account for the correct way to maximize the number of triangles. It incorrectly calculates the gaps and adds triangles without considering the optimal placement of additional vertices.

Here's a corrected approach:
1. Start with `ans = x - 2` because initially, we can form `x - 2` triangles using the chosen vertices.
2. For each chosen vertex, check if adding the next two consecutive vertices (considering the cyclic nature of the polygon) forms new triangles.
3. Calculate the gaps between the chosen vertices and use these gaps to determine how many additional triangles can be formed by adding up to `y` more vertices.

The corrected program would look something like this:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [num - 1 for num in a]
        a.sort()
        present = set(a)
        ans = x - 2
        
        # Check if we can form more triangles by adding consecutive vertices
        for i in range(x):
            t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
            t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
            if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
                ans += 1
        
        # Calculate gaps and form triangles
        gaps = []
        for i in range(x):
            next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
            gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
            if gap > 0:
                gaps.append(gap)
        
        gaps.sort()
        for gap in gaps:
            pairs = min(gap // 2, y)
            ans += pairs * 2
            y -= pairs
            if y == 0:
                break
        
        print(ans)
```

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly for all test cases.
