Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[4 % x] + n`, `gap` is `a[3 % x] + n - a[2] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0`. If `gap` is not greater than 0, `gaps` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 3.
- `x` must be a positive integer greater than 2.
- `next_elem` is calculated as `a[3 % x] + n`.
- `gap` is calculated as `a[3 % x] + n - a[2] - 1`.
- `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains unchanged.

After executing the line `next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`:
- The value of `i` does not change, so `i` is still 3.
- `x` remains the same since it is not reassigned.
- `next_elem` is updated to `a[(3 + 1) % x] + (n if 3 == x - 1 else 0)`, which simplifies to `a[4 % x] + n` because `(3 + 1) % x` is equivalent to `4 % x`.
- The value of `gap` and the list `gaps` remain unchanged unless `gap` is recalculated and found to be less than or equal to 0, which is not specified in the given code snippet.
