Output State: **`i` is 2; `t1` is (a[2] + 1) % n; `t2` is (a[i] + 2) % n and is in `present`; `ans` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `t1`, `t2`, and `present` remain unchanged from their initial states.
