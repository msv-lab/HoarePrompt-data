Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[x % x]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing one element which is the current value of `gap`, and if `gap > 0`, the function does not change `gap`; otherwise, no change is made to `gap`.
