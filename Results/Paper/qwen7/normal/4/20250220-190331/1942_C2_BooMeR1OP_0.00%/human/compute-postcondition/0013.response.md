Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t1` is \((a[0] + 1) \% n\) and is not in `present`
   - `t2` is \((a[0] + 2) \% n\) and is in `present`
   - `ans` is 1

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(x)`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`t1`, `t2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop condition itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n and is not in `present`, `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in `present`, `ans` is 1**
