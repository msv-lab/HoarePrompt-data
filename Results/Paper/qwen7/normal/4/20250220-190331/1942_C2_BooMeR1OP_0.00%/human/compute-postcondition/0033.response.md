Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[x % x]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `gaps` is a list containing one element which is the current value of `gap`. If `gap > 0`, then `gap` remains unchanged and is added to the list `gaps`; otherwise, `gaps` remains unchanged.
