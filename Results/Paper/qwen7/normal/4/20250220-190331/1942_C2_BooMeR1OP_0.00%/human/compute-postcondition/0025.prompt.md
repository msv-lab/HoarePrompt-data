Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2⋅10^5), and `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the variable `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing elements from the list `a` where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `ans` is x - 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1; `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n and is not in `present`; `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in `present`; `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2; `t1` is (a[2] + 1) % n; `t2` is (a[i] + 2) % n and is in `present`; if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, then `ans` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t2` is (a[3] + 2) % n, and `ans` is 1 if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `t2` is (a[3] + 2) % n, and `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
