Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `x`, `t1` will be `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` will be `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, and `ans` will be incremented for each iteration where `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, meaning the loop has executed `x` times. The variables `t1` and `t2` will hold the values `(a[x-1] + 1) % n` and `(a[x-1] + 2) % n` respectively. The variable `ans` will be increased by 1 for each iteration where the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is satisfied.
