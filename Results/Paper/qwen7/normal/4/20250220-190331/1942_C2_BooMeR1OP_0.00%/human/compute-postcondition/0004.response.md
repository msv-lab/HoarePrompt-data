Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2⋅10^5), and `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the variable `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing elements from the list `a` where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`.**

The code creates a set named `present` which contains the elements from the list `a` after subtracting 1 from each element in the original list `a`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
