You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    gaps = []

        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)

    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached the value of `x`, indicating that the loop has processed every index from `0` to `x-1`. The variable `next_elem` will be calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + n` if `i` is less than `x-1`, or simply `a[x % x]` if `i` is `x-1`. The `gap` is computed as the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1. If `gap` is positive, it gets appended to the `gaps` list. Thus, `gaps` will contain all positive `gap` values calculated throughout the loop's iterations.

    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all gap values added during each iteration of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and returns the sum of certain gaps derived from the input data. Specifically, it counts how many gaps of size 1 or 2 are present between consecutive elements in the list of chosen vertices, and then sums up the remaining gaps after adjusting based on the value of y. If y is insufficient to cover all possible pairs, it uses the available y to maximize the sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of `x` chosen vertices.
   - The vertices are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing, which is necessary for modulo operations.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `x - 2`. This is because any polygon with at least 4 vertices can be divided into at least 2 triangles, and adding more vertices can increase the number of triangles.

3. **Initial Triangles Calculation:**
   - The program checks for initial triangles by looking at the immediate neighbors of the chosen vertices. If the next vertex is not chosen, it adds one more triangle to `ans`.

4. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - It sorts these gaps to process the largest gaps first.
   - For each gap, it tries to maximize the number of triangles by using up to `y` additional vertices.

5. **Triangle Addition Based on Gaps:**
   - For each gap, the program calculates how many pairs of vertices can fit within the gap.
   - If there are enough remaining choices (`y`), it adds the full gap value to `ans` and reduces `y`.
   - If not, it adds the maximum possible triangles based on the remaining choices and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the total number of triangles `ans`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum required vertices correctly by initializing `ans` to `x - 2`.
   - It processes gaps in a way that ensures the maximum number of triangles is achieved.

2. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic for checking immediate neighbors and processing gaps is sound.
   - The sorting of gaps ensures that larger gaps are processed first, which is optimal for maximizing the number of triangles.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints on `y` and ensures that it does not exceed the available choices.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles all specified cases appropriately. Therefore, the program should work as intended for the given problem.
