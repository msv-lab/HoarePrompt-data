Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 3`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `le - (n - 2)`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l+1` are equal. Each iteration increments `l` and `st`. After the loop terminates, `l` will be one more than `r`, meaning `l = n - 3` if `r = n - 2`. This implies that the sequence of equal consecutive elements starts from index 0 and goes up to `n-4` (inclusive), making `st` equal to `le - (n - 2)`. The value of `ans` remains as initially defined.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 4`, `r` is `n - 3 - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `le - (n - 2)`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 5`, `r` is `n - 6`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `-2`, `end` is 3, `ans` is `-1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 0, `l` must be decreased to allow `r > l`, `r` is now `n - 7`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is 4, `ans` is -1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
