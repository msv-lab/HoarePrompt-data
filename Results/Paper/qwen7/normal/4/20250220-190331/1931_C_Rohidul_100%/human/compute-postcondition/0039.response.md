Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `l` and `r`. Initially, `l` was `0` and `r` was `n - 1`. After executing `l, r = 0, n - 1`, `l` remains `0` and `r` is updated to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
