Output State: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and increase `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the elements at `l` and `l + 1` are equal. Given that the loop has executed until `l` reaches `n - 1`, it means that either all consecutive duplicates in the list `a` have been skipped or there were no more pairs of consecutive equal elements. At this point, `l` will be equal to `r`, and the condition `l < r` will no longer be true, causing the loop to terminate. The value of `st` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `st` once for each iteration.
