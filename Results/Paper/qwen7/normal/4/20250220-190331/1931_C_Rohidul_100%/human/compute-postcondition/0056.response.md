Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 5`, `r` is `n - 6`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `-3`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `-1**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 5` to `n - 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
