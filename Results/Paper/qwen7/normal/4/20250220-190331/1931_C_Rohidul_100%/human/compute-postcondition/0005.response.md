Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `st` and `end` to 1. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `n`, `a`, and `le`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
