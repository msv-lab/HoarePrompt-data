Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 3`, `r` is `n - 3 - 1`, `end` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `end` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it is incremented). The values of `total`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `total` is still 0, `l` is still `n - 3`, `r` is still `n - 3 - 1`, and `end` is now 1.
