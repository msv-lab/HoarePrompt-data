Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was 1, so after executing the code, `l` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`total`, `r`, `a`, `le`, `st`, and `end`) remain unchanged.
