Output State: `total` is 0, `l` is equal to `n`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` are equal. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` is incremented by 1. Since the loop stops when `l` is no longer less than `r`, the final value of `l` will be `n` (since `r` starts at `n - 1` and remains unchanged). The variable `st` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration until `l` equals `r`, which means `st` will be `n`. All other variables (`total`, `a`, `le`, `end`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
