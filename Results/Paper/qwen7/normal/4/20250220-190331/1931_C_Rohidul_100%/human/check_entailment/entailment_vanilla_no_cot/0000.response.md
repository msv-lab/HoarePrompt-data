Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Operation Understanding**: The problem allows you to change a subarray to a single value at a cost proportional to the length of the subarray. The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.

2. **Current Logic**: The current logic in the program only checks if the first and last elements are the same and tries to minimize the cost based on that. However, it does not consider the possibility of changing other parts of the array to match these values.

3. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the cost as `le - max(st, end)` which is not correct. This logic does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal.

4. **Missing Optimal Strategy**: The program does not implement the optimal strategy to find the minimum cost. It should identify the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost to change all other elements to this most frequent element.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Identify the most frequent element in the array.
- Calculate the cost to change all other elements to this most frequent element.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = Counter(a)
        
        # Find the most frequent element
        most_common_element = freq.most_common(1)[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element
        cost = sum(n - count for element, count in freq.items() if element != most_common_element)
        
        print(cost)

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that you are making the optimal choice to minimize the cost, which aligns with the problem requirements.
