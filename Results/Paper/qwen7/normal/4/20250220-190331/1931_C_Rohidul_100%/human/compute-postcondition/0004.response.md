Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`.**

In this code, `l` is assigned the value `0` and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `le` remain unchanged from their initial state.
