Output State: **`data` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` (which is the first element of `data`) and `check`. The initial conditions for `data` and `i` remain unchanged.
