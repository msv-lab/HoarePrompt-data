Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
