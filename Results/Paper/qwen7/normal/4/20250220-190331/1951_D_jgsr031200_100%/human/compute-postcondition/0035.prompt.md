You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns k, which is equal to n since both are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: `h` is 2, `n` is -1, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1].
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `h` remains 2 because each iteration adds `n // i` to `h` and decreases `n` by `i * curr`. The loop terminates when `n` becomes less than the smallest element in `costs`, which is 1. Since `n` is reduced to -1, it means that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The `costs` list also remains unchanged as it was not modified during the loop's execution.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 1 - k 1
    #State: `h` is 2, `n` is -1, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1]. If `h` is less than `k`, no changes occur. If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes occur either since the loop does not modify these variables.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and k, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It returns k if n equals k, otherwise it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns k, which is equal to n since both are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
