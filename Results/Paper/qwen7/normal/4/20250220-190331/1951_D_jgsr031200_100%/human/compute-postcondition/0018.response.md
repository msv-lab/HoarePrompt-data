Output State: **`h` is `n // i + n // 1`, `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // 1`**.

Explanation: The line `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n`, the value of `h` is updated to `h + n // 1`, which is `h + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
