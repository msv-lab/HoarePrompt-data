Output State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `h` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `costs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
