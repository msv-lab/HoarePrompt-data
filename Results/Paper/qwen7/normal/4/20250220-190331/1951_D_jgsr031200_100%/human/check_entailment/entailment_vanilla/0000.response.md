Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case.
   - The function takes `n` and `k` as parameters.

3. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by spending all her coins at a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is a valid scenario.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This indicates that it's impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. This is also correct.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The logic here is flawed. The current implementation attempts to use binary search (`bs`) which is commented out, and then tries to calculate the number of stalls and their prices.
   - The commented-out binary search function is not used in the actual logic.
   - The main logic tries to split `n` into two parts and check if the sum of the quotients (when `n` is divided by these parts) is at least `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each test case, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with appropriate prices.
   - We can achieve this by setting up stalls with decreasing prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correct Implementation:

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Determine the number of stalls needed
    stalls = []
    current_price = 10**18
    while k > 0:
        if n >= current_price:
            stalls.append(current_price)
            n -= current_price
            k -= 1
        else:
            current_price //= 2

    # Ensure no more than 60 stalls
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(" ".join(map(str, stalls)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Reads `t` and processes each test case.

2. **Determine Stalls:**
   - Start with the highest possible price (`10^18`).
   - For each stall, if Alice can afford the current price, subtract the cost from `n` and decrement `k`.
   - Halve the price for the next stall if Alice cannot afford the current price.

3. **Check Stall Limit:**
   - Ensure the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
   - Print "YES" and the number of stalls along with their prices if the condition is met; otherwise, print "NO".

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws and does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
