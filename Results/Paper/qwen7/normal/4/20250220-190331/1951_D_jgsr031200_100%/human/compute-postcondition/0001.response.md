Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Since the value of `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k`, and there are no other variables or conditions affecting the output, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
