Output State: **`h` is `n // i`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The line `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the current value of `curr`, which is `n // i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
