Output State: **`h` is 2, `n` is `n - 1 * (n // 1)`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // 1**.

Explanation: The code sets `curr` to the value of `n // i`. Given that `i` is initially `1`, `curr` is set to `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n` since dividing by 1 does not change the value. The other variables (`h`, `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
