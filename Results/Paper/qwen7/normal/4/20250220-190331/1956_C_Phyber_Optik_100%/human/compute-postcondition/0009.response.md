Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4, `sum` is 20**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable. Initially, `i` is 4. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `(4 * 4 - 3 * 3) * 4`, which is `(16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28 / 2 = 20`. Therefore, `sum` is updated to 20. The other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
