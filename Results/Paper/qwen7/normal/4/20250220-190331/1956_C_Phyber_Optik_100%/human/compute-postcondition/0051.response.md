Output State: **`sum` is increased by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. It also increments `i` by 1. The condition that `i` must be less than or equal to `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described in the output state.
