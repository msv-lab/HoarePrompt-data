Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - We don't have specific values for `j` or `n` given, but we know that the loop has just completed an iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop just completed an iteration, `j` must have been incremented from its previous value.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that the loop just finished an iteration, let's assume `j` was incremented by 1 (since it starts at 1 and increments by default in a range loop). Therefore, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is now `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is k + 1, `n` must be the same as before**.

If we need to provide specific values, we would need the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration. However, without that information, the general form is as above.
