Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `k + 1`
   - `n` must be the same as before

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j` for the next iteration**: Since `j` starts from `k + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `k + 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `j` is now `k + 2`, the loop will continue if `k + 2 <= n`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j` (which becomes `k + 2`) and `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is `k + 2`, `n` must be the same as before**
