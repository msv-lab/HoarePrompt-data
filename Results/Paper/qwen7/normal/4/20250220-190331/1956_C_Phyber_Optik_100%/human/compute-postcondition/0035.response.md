State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `j` is 1, and `sum` is 140**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values**: 
   - `j` starts at 1 because the loop is defined as `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - `i` is mentioned in the output state and is set to 6. This implies that after the loop completes, `i` should be 6. Given that `i` is incremented within the loop, and it starts from 2, it takes 4 iterations to reach 6 (2 + 4 = 6).
3. **Determine Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is 6 after the loop, and it starts from 2, the loop must run for 4 iterations (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, `n` must be at least 6.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The problem mentions that `sum` is 140 after the loop. Given that the loop runs for 5 iterations (from 1 to 5), and assuming the sum is calculated based on these iterations, the sum being 140 suggests a specific calculation within the loop body. However, since no specific formula for `sum` is provided, we can infer that the sum is correctly calculated over the iterations, and the final state reflects this.

Thus, the required states to be adjusted are `i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `j` is 1, and `sum` is 140.
