Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(2, n + 1):`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
   - `n` must be at least 2 (this variable is part of the loop head and needs adjustment).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is part of the loop head and needs adjustment).
   - `sum` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop starts from 2 up to `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 3) must still be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain at least 2 or increase to allow `i` to be less than `n + 1`.

Given these points, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `sum` is 2**
