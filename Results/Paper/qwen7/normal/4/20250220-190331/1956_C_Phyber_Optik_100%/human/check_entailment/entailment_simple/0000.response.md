Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. The provided code attempts to calculate the sum and the number of operations required, but it does not actually perform the operations as specified in the problem statement.
3. The logic in the code calculates a sum based on a mathematical formula, which does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the formula used (`sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`) does not relate to the problem's constraints or the desired outcome.
4. The code prints the sum and the number of operations as \( n + n \), which is \( 2n \), but it does not perform any actual operations on the matrix as required by the problem.
5. The code then prints pairs of operations, but these pairs do not correspond to the correct permutations of rows or columns as per the problem statement. Instead, it prints the same permutation for both row and column operations, which is not valid according to the problem's rules.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
