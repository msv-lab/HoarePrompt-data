Based on the initial state provided:

- `sum` is 156 (though this value is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 3.
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. `2` is directly printed.
2. `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 3, this becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output, which is 6.

So, the expression `n - 2` would be `6 - 2 = 4`.

Therefore, the print statement would output:
```
2 4 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Output: **2 4 1 2 3 4 5 6**
