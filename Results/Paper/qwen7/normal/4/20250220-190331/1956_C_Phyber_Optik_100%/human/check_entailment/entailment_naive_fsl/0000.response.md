Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, it calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the operations described. The program also does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations. Each operation involves either permuting the rows or columns of the matrix. However, the given program simply prints a fixed sum and a number of operations without actually performing any permutations.

For example, consider a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The correct approach would involve swapping rows or columns to maximize the sum, but the program does not do this. Instead, it prints a sum calculated by a different formula and performs no actual operations.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
