Based on the initial state provided:

- `sum` is explicitly given as 156.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 6, but its exact value is not specified.
- `t` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `2`: This is a constant value.
2. `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is just `n`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

Since `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output:
- If `n = 6`, then `n - j + 1` would be `6 - 1 + 1 = 6`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `2`
- `6` (which is `n`)
- The sequence of numbers from 1 to 7 (since `range(1, 6 + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to 7).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7**
