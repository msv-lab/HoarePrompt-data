Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`**.

Explanation: The code `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. This changes the value of `temp` from `i + 1` to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
