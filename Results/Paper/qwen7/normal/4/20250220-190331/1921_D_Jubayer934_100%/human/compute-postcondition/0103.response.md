Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` in the range of `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `temp` will be set to `n` because the loop breaks when it finds an index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met. If no such index is found, `temp` remains `-1`. However, since the loop runs for all `i` in the range of `n`, `temp` will be set to `n` if the loop does not break early. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between each corresponding pair of elements from lists `a` and `b` for all `i` in the range of `n`.
