Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same (since `n` is not being modified within the loop head).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - The value of `ans` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.
