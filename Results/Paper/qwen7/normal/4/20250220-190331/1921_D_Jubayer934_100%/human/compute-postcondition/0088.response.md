Output State: **`temp` is equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than 0, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at index `-(n - i)` in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at index `i` in `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
