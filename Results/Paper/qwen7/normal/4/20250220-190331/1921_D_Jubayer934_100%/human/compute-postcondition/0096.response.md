Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `temp`, or the condition that `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `temp` remains as `i + 1` because it was set previously and is not altered by this line of code. The updated list `ans` now includes the new element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The condition regarding breaking out of the loop if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` remains unchanged.
