Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the first `n` sorted integers from the input, `b` is a list of the top `m` integers (in descending order) from the input integers.**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts them to integers, sorts them in descending order, and then takes the first `m` elements from this sorted list. This results in a new list `b`.
- The original values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged.
- `ans` remains a list containing the first `n` sorted integers from the input, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
- `b` is the list of the top `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
