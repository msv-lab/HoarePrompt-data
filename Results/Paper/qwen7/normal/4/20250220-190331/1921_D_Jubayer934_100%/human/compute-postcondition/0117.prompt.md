Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is less than `n`, and the list `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index `temp` to `n-1` in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` remains `-1`, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `temp` holds the index where the condition was last true or remains -1 if the condition was never met, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
