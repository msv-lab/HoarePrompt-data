Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `temp` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `temp`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list with one element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `temp`, for the loop to continue, `i` (which will be `temp + 1`) must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `temp` must be incremented by 1 to become `temp + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `temp + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is already greater than 0.
   - The value of `ans` does not change as it is determined by the values of `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, which depend on the current `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `temp + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with one element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`**.
