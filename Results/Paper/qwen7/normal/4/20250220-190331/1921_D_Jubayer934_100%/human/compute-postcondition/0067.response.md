Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved here are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is within the range defined by `temp` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will start when `i` is at least `temp` and less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, this means `i` must change to a value within the range `[temp, n)` for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the range `[temp, n)`. Given that `i` is initially equal to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be at least `temp` but less than `n`.
   - `temp` and `n` must be such that the range `[temp, n)` is valid and non-empty.

4. **Consider other given states**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (already given).
   - `temp` is not -1 (already given).
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and `b` in order from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]` (this state is not directly relevant to the loop head).

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`, `temp` is not -1, `n` must be greater than 0**.
