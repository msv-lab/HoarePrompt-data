Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (as per the `range(n)`), we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 and `n` must be a positive integer.

4. **List the states that need to be adjusted**: We need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
