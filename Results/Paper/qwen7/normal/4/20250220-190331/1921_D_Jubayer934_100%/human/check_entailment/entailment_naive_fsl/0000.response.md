Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum total difference \(D\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to assign elements from the sorted `b` list to the `ans` list is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 10 2 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
23
```
- Program Output:
```
16
```

The program incorrectly assigns values from the reversed sorted `b` list to the `ans` list. For example, when calculating the differences for the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4]` from `a`, the program should ideally maximize the differences by assigning the largest available values from `b` to `a`. However, the current logic does not always achieve this.

A correct approach would involve dynamically selecting the best possible value from `b` for each element in `a` to maximize the total difference. This requires a more sophisticated assignment strategy, such as using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming, to ensure the maximum difference is achieved.
