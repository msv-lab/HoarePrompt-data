Output State: **`ans` now contains `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])`, `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n - 1`; `temp` is not -1; `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` already contained `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, it now includes an additional element, which is `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`. The conditions on the variables `i`, `temp`, and `n` remain unchanged.
