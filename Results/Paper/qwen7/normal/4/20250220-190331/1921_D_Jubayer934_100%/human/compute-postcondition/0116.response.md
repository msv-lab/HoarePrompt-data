Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `temp` holds the index where the condition was last true or remains -1 if the condition was never met.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.

The `print(sum(ans))` statement calculates the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.

Since `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`, the sum of these differences will be computed and printed.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`**
