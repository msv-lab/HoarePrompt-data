Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts `a` and `b` in ascending and descending order respectively.
4. The program then iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and compares the absolute differences with the corresponding elements of `b` (in descending order).
5. If the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met, it records the index `i` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it appends the absolute difference to the list `ans`.
6. If the condition is met at any point, the program adjusts the remaining elements of `ans` using the recorded index `temp`.
7. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly. The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D\) by strategically choosing elements from `b` to pair with elements from `a`. The approach of sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, and then comparing the differences, ensures that the differences are maximized.

Therefore, the program is designed to solve the problem as intended.
