Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `temp` will still be less than `n`, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index 0 to `n-1` in ascending order.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that every index from `temp` to `n-1` in list `a` has been processed. The list `ans` will contain all the calculated absolute differences as described, covering all elements in `a` and `b` from the starting index `temp` to the end of the lists.
