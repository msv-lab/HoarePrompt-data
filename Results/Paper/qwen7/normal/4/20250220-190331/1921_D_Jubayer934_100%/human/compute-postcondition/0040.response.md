Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is -1, and the list `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index `temp` to `n-1` in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code sets `temp` to -1. This does not affect the values of `i` or the list `ans`. The initial conditions for `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
