Output State: **`i` is equal to `temp`, `n` must be greater than 0, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `temp`. This means that `temp` now holds the same value as `i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
