Output State: **`i` is `temp + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first and second elements are the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the third element is the same as the first element.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` had two elements: the first was the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the second was the same as the first. After appending, `ans` now has three elements: the first and second elements remain the same, and the third element is the newly appended value. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `temp`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial conditions.
