Output State: **`i` is `temp`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with one element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is `temp` and `n` is greater than 0, these values remain unchanged. The new element added to `ans` is the calculated absolute difference.
