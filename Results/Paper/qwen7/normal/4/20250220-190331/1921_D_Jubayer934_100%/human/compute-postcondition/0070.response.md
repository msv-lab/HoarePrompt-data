Output State: **`ans` now contains `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`; `temp` is not -1; `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ans`. The new value is calculated as `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`. The previous value of `ans` was `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])`. The values of `i`, `temp`, and `n` remain unchanged.
