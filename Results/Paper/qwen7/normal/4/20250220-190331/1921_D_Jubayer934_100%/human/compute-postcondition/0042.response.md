Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the first `n` sorted integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]` takes an input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, sorts these integers, and then takes the first `n` elements from the sorted list. The sorted integers are stored in the list `a`. The variables `i` and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
