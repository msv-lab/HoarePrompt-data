Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n` used in the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
