Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `temp + 1` and `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Update the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value (`temp + 1`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `temp + 2`.
   - The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged because it is an invariant condition for the loop (it doesn't change within the loop).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from `temp + 1` to `temp + 2`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

5. **Consider the list `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` contains two elements: the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, and the same value.
   - Since `i` is changing but `n` remains the same, the values in `ans` will be recalculated based on the new `i` value.

Given these steps, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is `temp + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 2))]` and the second element is the same as the first element.**
