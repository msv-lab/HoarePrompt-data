Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the context where the `ans` list and other variables were being manipulated. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we are exiting the relevant block.
