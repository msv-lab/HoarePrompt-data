Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` generates a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets will be subsequences of the generated string. 

For example, consider the case where `n=2` and `k=2`. The program would generate "aabb", but this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using 'a' and 'b', such as "ab" or "ba". 

A correct solution would need to construct a string that ensures all permutations of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences. One way to achieve this is by constructing a de Bruijn sequence, but even simpler constructions can work for small values of `n` and `k`.
