Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer within the range 1 to 676. The values of `n` and `k` are now set to the integers entered by the user.
