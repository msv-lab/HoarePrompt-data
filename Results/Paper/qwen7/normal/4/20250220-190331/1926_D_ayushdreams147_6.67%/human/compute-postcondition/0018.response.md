Postcondition: **`res` is either 2 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, `count` is a dictionary where the first element of the list `a` is a key. If `num` is not in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is already in `count`, then the value of each key in `count` is decreased by 1.**
