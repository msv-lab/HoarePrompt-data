Output State: **`res` is either 2 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, `count` is a dictionary where the first element of the list `a` is a key, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was either 1 or 0 initially, it now becomes either 2 or 1 (if it was 0). The values of `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
