Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\), and `count` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num not in count:
        count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
        res += 1
    else:
        count[num] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is either 1 or 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, `count` is a dictionary where the first element of the list `a` is a key. If the first element `num` of the list `a` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is already in `count`, then `res` is 0 and the value of each key in `count` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is either 2 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, `count` is a dictionary where the first element of the list `a` is a key. If `num` is not in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is already in `count`, then the value of each key in `count` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is either 2 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, and `count` is a dictionary where the second element of the list `a` is a key. If `num` is not in `count`, then the value of `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is in `count`, then the value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
