Output State: **`j` is equal to `m + 1`, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `m + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
