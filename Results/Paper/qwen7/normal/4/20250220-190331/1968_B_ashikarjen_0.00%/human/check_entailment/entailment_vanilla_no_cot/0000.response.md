Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `k` and `j` to 0. `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will iterate through `b`.

3. **Iterating Through String `a`**:
   - For each character in `a`, it uses a while loop to find the corresponding character in `b`.
   - If the current character of `a` matches a character in `b`, it increments both `k` and `j`.
   - If no match is found within the bounds of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. Given the constraints and examples provided, the function behaves as expected and thus is correct.
