Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` is equal to 1, and the condition `j < m` is true.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their original conditions and values as specified in the initial state.
