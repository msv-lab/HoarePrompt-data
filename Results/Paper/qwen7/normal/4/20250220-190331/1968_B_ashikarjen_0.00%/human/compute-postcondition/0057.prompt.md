You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal any character in the string `a` for all iterations, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `k` is equal to the number of times the inner `while` loop did not find a match for `a[i]` before `j` reached `m`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will always be equal to `m`, meaning it has gone through the entire length of the string `b`. The variable `k` will count how many times the condition `b[j] != a[i]` was true across all iterations of the outer loop, indicating the number of mismatches found between the characters of `a` and `b` up to the length of `m`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will retain their initial states as they were not modified within the loop.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of mismatches between the characters of `a` and `b` up to the length of `m`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n and m (both integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings a and b (of lengths n and m respectively). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
