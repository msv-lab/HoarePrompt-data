Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is incremented by 1 (`j = j + 1`)
   - `m` is greater than `j` (`m > j`)
   - `b[j]` (which is `b[m-1]`) must not equal `a[i]`

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true.
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `j + 1 < m` and `b[j + 1] != a[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure `j + 1 < m`, `m` must still be greater than `j + 1`.
   - To ensure `b[j + 1] != a[i]`, `b[j + 1]` must not equal `a[i]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure these conditions hold true for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `b[j + 1]` must not equal `a[i]`**
