Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 10^4.
