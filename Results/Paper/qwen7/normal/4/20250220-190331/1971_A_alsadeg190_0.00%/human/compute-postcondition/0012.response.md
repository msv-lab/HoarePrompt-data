Based on the initial state provided, `x` and `y` are integers from the input split. This means that when the `print(x, y)` statement is executed, it will print the values of `x` and `y` which were obtained from splitting the input.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we will represent them as placeholders `[x]` and `[y]`.

Output: **[x] [y]**
