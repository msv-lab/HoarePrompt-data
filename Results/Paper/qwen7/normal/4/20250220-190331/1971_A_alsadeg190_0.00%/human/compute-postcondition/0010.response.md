Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(x):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (though this variable is not directly involved in the loop).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - If `x` is greater than `y`, then no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, we need to update the state to reflect the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be 1.
- `x` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute again.

Since the initial value of `x` is not specified, we assume it is an input integer that could be greater than 1 for the loop to continue. However, since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we only update the known state.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `y` is an input integer.**
