Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to take multiple pairs of integers (x, y) as input and for each pair, output the minimum and maximum of the pair.
2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case by reading two integers (`x` and `y`) per line.
3. **Comparison Logic**: For each pair of integers, the program correctly compares them and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.
4. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs exactly `t` times, processing each test case correctly.
5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the expected format where for each test case, the minimum and maximum of the pair are printed on a new line.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to handle the problem correctly according to the problem statement and example input/output.

Correctness: **True**
