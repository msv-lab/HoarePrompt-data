Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is the total number of iterations `x` went through (which is equal to the final value of `x` input in the last iteration), `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `y` is an integer equal to the second input integer. Regardless of the condition inside the loop, `x` and `y` retain their original values from the last input provided.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range 1 to 100, `i` will be equal to the total number of times the loop ran (which is the same as the final value of `x` input), and `x` and `y` will be the values of the last pair of integers entered into the loop, with no changes applied based on the comparison inside the loop.
