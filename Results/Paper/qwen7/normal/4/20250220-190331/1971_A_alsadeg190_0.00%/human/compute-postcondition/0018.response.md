Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer.
- `y` is an integer equal to the second input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

This statement will print the value of `y` followed by a space, and then the value of `x`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **y x (where y is the second input integer and x is the first input integer)**
