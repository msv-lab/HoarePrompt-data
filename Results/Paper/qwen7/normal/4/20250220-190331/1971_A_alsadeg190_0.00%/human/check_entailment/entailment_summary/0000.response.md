Reasoning:
- The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers (x, y) for multiple test cases.
- The provided program defines a function `func()` that takes an integer `x` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
- Inside the function, there is a loop that runs `x` times, where for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers (x, y) and prints the minimum and maximum of the pair.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the swapping logic for each test case. Instead, it only ensures that the printed values are in non-decreasing order for the entire set of inputs, rather than for each individual pair.
- This means that after processing all test cases, the program will print the final values of `x` and `y` from the last input pair, which does not meet the requirement of printing the minimum and maximum for each pair separately.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
