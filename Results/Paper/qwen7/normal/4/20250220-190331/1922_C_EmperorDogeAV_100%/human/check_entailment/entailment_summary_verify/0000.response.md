Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` aims to determine the closest city for each city in the list `cities`. However, the function summary provided does not accurately describe what the function does. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

1. **Back and Forward Initialization**: The variables `back` and `forward` are initialized with extreme values to handle edge cases.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For each city, it calculates the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`).
3. **Closest City Determination**: If the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, it sets the corresponding element in `prog_cities` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

This logic does not correctly identify the closest city because it only considers the immediate neighbors and does not ensure that the closest city is unique for each city. The function summary is misleading because it suggests that the function returns a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements, but it actually returns a list where each element is 1 if the next city is closer, or the absolute difference if the previous city is closer.

### Analysis of Main Program Logic

The main program logic involves computing prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) based on the output of `func_1`. However, the prefix sums are not correctly computed because the `func_1` function itself is incorrect.

1. **Prefix Sums Computation**: The prefix sums are computed based on the output of `func_1`, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.
2. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program determines the minimum cost of travel by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums. However, since the prefix sums are incorrect, the results will be wrong.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city for each city, and the prefix sums are computed based on an incorrect function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
