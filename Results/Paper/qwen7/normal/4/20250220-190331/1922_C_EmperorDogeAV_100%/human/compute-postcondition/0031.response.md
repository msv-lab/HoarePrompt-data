Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `back` is `cities[0]`, and `forward` is either `cities[2]` (if `i < n - 1`) or `back` remains `cities[0]` (if `i` is not less than `n - 1`). Additionally, `prog_cities[i]` is the minimum of the absolute differences between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[1]` if `i` is 2.
