Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city for each city. The `func_1` function attempts to determine the closest city by comparing the distances to the neighboring cities, but it does not ensure that the closest city is unique for each city. Additionally, the program uses prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) to calculate the minimum cost of travel, but these sums are not correctly computed based on the closest city logic.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Cities are located in points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- The closest city to each city is:
  - City 1: City 2 (distance 8)
  - City 2: City 3 (distance 4)
  - City 3: City 4 (distance 3)
  - City 4: City 3 (distance 3)
  - City 5: City 4 (distance 5)

However, the program incorrectly computes the prefix sums and does not account for the unique closest city condition. For instance, in the first query (from city 1 to city 4), the program should compute the cost as 3 coins (1 + 1 + 1), but it might not do so due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

A correct implementation would involve maintaining an array that stores the index of the closest city for each city and then using this information to compute the minimum cost of travel.
