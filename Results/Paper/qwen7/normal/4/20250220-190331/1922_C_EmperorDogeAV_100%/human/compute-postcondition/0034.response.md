Output State: **`back` is `-99999999999999999999`, `forward` is `cities[2]`, `prog_cities[1]` is `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided does not show any changes being made to the variables `back`, `forward`, or `prog_cities[1]`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is in the value of `back`, which is explicitly set to `-99999999999999999999`. The other variables retain their initial values based on the provided initial state.
