Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (since `range(n-1)` generates values from `0` to `n-2`).

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is either `1` or `2`.
   - `back` is `cities[0]`.
   - `forward` is either `cities[2]` (if `i < n - 1`) or `back` remains `cities[0]` (if `i` is not less than `n - 1`).
   - If `i` is `1`, `prog_cities[1]` is `1`.
   - If `i` is `2`, `prog_cities[1]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[1]`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - If `i` was `1`, it will become `2`.
   - If `i` was `2`, it will become `3`, but since the loop only goes up to `n-2`, this means the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states based on the new value of `i`:**
   - If `i` was `1`, it becomes `2`.
     - `back` remains `cities[0]`.
     - `forward` changes to `cities[2]` because `i < n - 1` (assuming `n > 3`).
     - `prog_cities[1]` changes to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[1]`, which is `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`.
   - If `i` was `2`, the loop terminates.

Given these steps, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was `1`, then `i` becomes `2`.
- If `i` was `2`, the loop terminates.

Since the loop will terminate if `i` is `2`, we only need to consider the case where `i` is `1`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is `2`.
- `back` is `cities[0]`.
- `forward` is `cities[2]`.
- `prog_cities[1]` is `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration (or the final state) is:

State: **`i` is 2, `back` is `cities[0]`, `forward` is `cities[2]`, `prog_cities[1]` is `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`**
