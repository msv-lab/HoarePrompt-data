#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the function also takes an additional parameter m which is the number of queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5).
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: All elements in `prog_cities` are either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in `cities`.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the original `cities` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order and an integer `m` (though `m` is not used in the function). It returns a new list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the original `cities` list. For each city coordinate in `cities`, if the absolute difference between the current city and the next city is smaller than the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the current and next city coordinates.
