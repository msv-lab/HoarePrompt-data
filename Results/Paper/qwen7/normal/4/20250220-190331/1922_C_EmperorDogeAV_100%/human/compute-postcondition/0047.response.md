Output State: **The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the original `cities` list.**

This means that for each element in `prog_cities`, if the element is 1, it remains 1. If the element is the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in `cities`, it retains that value. The exact values depend on the original `cities` list, but the structure of `prog_cities` is determined as described.
