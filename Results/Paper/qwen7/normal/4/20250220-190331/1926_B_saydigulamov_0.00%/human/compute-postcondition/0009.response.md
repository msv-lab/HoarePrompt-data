Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is the count of '1' in the string `b`, `k` is an empty list, and `b` is a string containing the input from `int(input())` converted to a string. If the string `b` contains the substring '1', then `i` is set to the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `i` remains 0.
