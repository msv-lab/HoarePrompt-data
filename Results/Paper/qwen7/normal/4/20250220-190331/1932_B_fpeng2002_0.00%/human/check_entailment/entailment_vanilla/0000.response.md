### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is used to track the current year.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: For each test case, it iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`).
4. **Year Calculation**: In the loop, it updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula aims to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step with an example from the problem statement:

- For the first test case: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `3` -> Next multiple of 3 after 0 is 3.
  - Second sign: `2` -> Next multiple of 2 after 3 is 4.
  - Third sign: `4` -> Next multiple of 4 after 4 is 8.
  - Fourth sign: `5` -> Next multiple of 5 after 8 is 10.
  - Fifth sign: `9` -> Next multiple of 9 after 10 is 18.
  - Sixth sign: `18` -> Next multiple of 18 after 18 is 36.

This matches the expected output of 36.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially according to the given periodicities. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
