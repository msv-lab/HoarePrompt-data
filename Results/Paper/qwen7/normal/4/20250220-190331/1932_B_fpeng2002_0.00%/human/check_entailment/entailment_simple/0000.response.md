Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur according to the Chaya tribe's belief. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `n` (number of signs) and reads the list of periodicities (`nums`).
3. **Computation of Start Year**: It initializes `start_year` to 0. Then, it iterates through the list of periodicities from the end to the beginning, updating `start_year` using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of the current periodicity after accounting for the previous periodicities.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the computed `start_year` for each test case.

The logic in the program matches the problem statement and the example provided. Each step is correctly implemented, and the final `start_year` is indeed the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Correctness: **True**
