Output State: **`x` is 0; `start_year` is (((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[0]` + 1) * `nums[0]`).**

Explanation: The variable `x` is initially set to 0, and `nums` is a list of integers. The code updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` is 0, `nums[x]` refers to the first element of the list `nums`. The updated value of `start_year` is calculated based on this formula, and `x` remains unchanged.
