You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula (((((...((start_year + 1) // nums[x-1]) + 1) * nums[x-1]) + 1) // nums[x-2] + 1) * nums[x-2]) + ... + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] to the initial value of `start_year`, which is 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` will be the final computed value after repeatedly applying the given formula to each element in the `nums` list from the last element to the first element, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. It first checks if the integer t is within the range 1 to 1000, then for each test case, it checks if the integer n is within the range 1 to 100, and finally, it processes a list of n integers where each integer a_i is within the range 1 to 10^6. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
