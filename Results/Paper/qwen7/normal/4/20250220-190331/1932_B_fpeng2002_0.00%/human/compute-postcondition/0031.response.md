Output State: **`num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and the value of `start_year` is updated according to the given formula. The list `nums` remains unchanged.
