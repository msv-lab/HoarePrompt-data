Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 1, the expression becomes `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.
