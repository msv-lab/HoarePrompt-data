Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2'], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `num1` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[0])`, `num2` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[1])**.

Explanation: The code appends a list containing `num1` and `num2` to the `numbers` list. Since `num1` and `num2` are derived from `nums`, which is a list of strings split from an input, their values remain as they were. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `nums`, `num1`, and `num2`) retain their original conditions and values.
