Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `numbers`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or `nums`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. Since no such context is provided, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
