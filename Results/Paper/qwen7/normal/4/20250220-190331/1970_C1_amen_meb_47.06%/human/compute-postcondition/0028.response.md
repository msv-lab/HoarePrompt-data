Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It repeatedly asks the user to input pairs of integers until the input does not consist of exactly two elements. For each valid input, it returns a list containing the pair of integers provided by the user. The length of the returned list depends on the user's inputs. Variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged and are not included in the return.**
