#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree represented by the edges has exactly two leaves.

    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])

    #State: Output State: `numbers` is a list containing pairs of integers read from the input until the loop condition is no longer met, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the input consists of exactly two elements. Each iteration appends a pair of integers (as a list) to the `numbers` list. This process repeats until the user provides an input that does not consist of exactly two elements, at which point the loop breaks. Therefore, the final state of `numbers` will be a list of all such pairs provided by the user, with the constraints on `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remaining unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of pairs of integers, where each pair is a list of two integers provided by the user, and the length of this list is determined by the user's inputs until they provide an input that does not consist of exactly two elements. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged and are not included in the return.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function repeatedly prompts the user to input pairs of integers until the input does not consist of exactly two elements. For each valid input, it collects these pairs into a list. After the loop breaks, it returns this list of pairs. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged and are not included in the return.
