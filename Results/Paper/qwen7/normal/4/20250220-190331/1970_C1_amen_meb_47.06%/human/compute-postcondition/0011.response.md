Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2'], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings from the input, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any of the variables' values. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial states, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional structure.
