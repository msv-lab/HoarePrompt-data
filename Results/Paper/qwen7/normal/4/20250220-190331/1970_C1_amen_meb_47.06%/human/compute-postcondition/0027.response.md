Output State: **The program returns a list of pairs of integers, where each pair is a list of two integers provided by the user, and the length of this list is determined by the user's inputs until they provide an input that does not consist of exactly two elements. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged and are not included in the return.**

This means the returned list will contain all the pairs of integers entered by the user before the loop condition is no longer met, while `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values.
