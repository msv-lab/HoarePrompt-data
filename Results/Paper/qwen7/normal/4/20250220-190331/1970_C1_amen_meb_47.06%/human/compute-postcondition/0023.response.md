Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`**.

Explanation: The code `num2 = int(nums[1])` assigns the integer value of the second element in the list `nums` to the variable `num2`. Since `nums` is `['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']]`, `num2` is assigned the integer value of `'num2'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
