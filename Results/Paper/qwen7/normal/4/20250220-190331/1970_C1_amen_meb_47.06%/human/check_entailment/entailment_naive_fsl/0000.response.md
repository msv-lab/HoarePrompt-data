Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` is designed to read pairs of numbers from input, but the problem description does not mention any input reading process. Instead, the problem states that the input consists of a fixed number of integers representing the edges of the tree and the starting nodes for each round. 

Moreover, the program tries to compare elements within the `result` list, which is not defined in the given code snippet. The `result` variable is used in the loop where it is assumed to contain pairs of integers, but there is no logic that populates this list according to the game rules.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.
