Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
   - `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Other states (`k` and `r`) are not affected by the loop head and thus do not change**.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
