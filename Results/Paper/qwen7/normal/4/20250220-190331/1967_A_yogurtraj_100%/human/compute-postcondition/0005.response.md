Output State: **`rem` is 0, `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `rem` to 0. The values of the other variables (`r`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
