Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `k` is 0
   - `r` is `a[n-1]`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 1
   - `ii` is 1
   - `k` is equal to 0 (This is redundant with the previous definition of `k`)

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `i` is `n-1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `k` is 0: This is explicitly stated.
   - `r` is `a[n-1]`: This means `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `rem` is 0: This is explicitly stated.
   - `y` is 1: This is explicitly stated.
   - `ii` is 1: This is explicitly stated.

3. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

4. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - `r` is `a[n-1]`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 1.
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, `r` is the last element of `a`, so let's denote it as `last_element_of_a`.

5. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - Substitute `r` with `last_element_of_a`:
     \[
     (last_element_of_a - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 1 = (last_element_of_a - 1) * n + 2
     \]

6. **Final Output:**
   - The expression simplifies to `(last_element_of_a - 1) * n + 2`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(last_element_of_a - 1) * n + 2**
