Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]); `r` is equal to a[i + 1]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The value of `i` remains either 1 or 2, and the value of `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
