Output State: **`k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `k` has been decreased by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and the value of `r` has been assigned to `a[i + 1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
