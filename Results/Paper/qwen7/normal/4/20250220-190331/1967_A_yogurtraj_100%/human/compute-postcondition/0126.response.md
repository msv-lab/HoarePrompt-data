Output State: **`k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. The values of `i`, `a[i]`, and `a[i + 1]` are used in this calculation, but their specific values are not provided, so they remain as part of the expression. The states of other variables are not affected.
