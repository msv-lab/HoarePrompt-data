Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]` if the condition in the else part is true, and `rem` is 0. If the condition in the if part is true, then `i` is 1, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
