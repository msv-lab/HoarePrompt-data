Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, and `y` is an integer. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.
