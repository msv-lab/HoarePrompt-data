Output State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is 0, this simplifies to `1 * (a[1] - a[0])`, which is `a[1] - a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
