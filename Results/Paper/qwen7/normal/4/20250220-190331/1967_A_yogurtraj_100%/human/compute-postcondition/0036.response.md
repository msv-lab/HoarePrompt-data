Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, we need to consider both cases:

- If `i` is 1, then the expression becomes `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1]) = 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- If `i` is 2, then the expression becomes `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2]) = 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.

Therefore, `k` is decreased by either `2 * (a[2] - a[1])` or `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, depending on the value of `i`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged as per the precondition.
