Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be evaluated:

1. `i` is equal to -1.
2. `n` is 0.
3. `k` is not 0.
4. `r` is the last element of the original list `a` + `k` // `n`.
5. `rem` is 0.
6. `y` is 1.

Given these values, let's evaluate the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Evaluate `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as the last element of the original list `a` plus `k // n`.
   - Since `n` is 0, the operation `k // n` is undefined in Python because division by zero is not allowed.
   - Therefore, `r` cannot be determined precisely without knowing the actual list `a`, but we know it involves adding `k // 0` to the last element of `a`, which is undefined.

2. **Evaluate `k % n`:**
   - Again, since `n` is 0, the operation `k % n` is also undefined in Python because modulo with zero is not allowed.
   - Thus, `k % n` is undefined.

3. **Evaluate the entire expression:**
   - Given that both `r` and `k % n` involve operations that are undefined (division by zero), the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` is also undefined.
   - Since the expression involves undefined operations, the result of the expression is undefined.

### Conclusion:
Given the undefined nature of the operations involved, the expression cannot be evaluated to a concrete value. Therefore, the output of the print statement is undefined.

Output: **undefined**
