Postcondition: `ans1` is the value after adding `a[i]` to the previous iteration's value, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be less than `k`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to the value after subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from the previous iteration's value.
