Postcondition: `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x] + a[0] + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `i + x` is less than `n`, the above operations are performed. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.
