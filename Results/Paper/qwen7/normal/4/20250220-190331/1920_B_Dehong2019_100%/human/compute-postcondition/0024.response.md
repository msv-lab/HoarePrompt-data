Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x] + a[0] + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 3, the updated expression for `ans1` becomes `ans1 - 2 * a[3 + x]`, which simplifies to `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x]`. The other variables (`ans2`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
