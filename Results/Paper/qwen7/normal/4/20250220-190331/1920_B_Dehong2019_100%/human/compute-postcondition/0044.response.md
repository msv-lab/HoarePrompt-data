Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`, `x` must be the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its current value. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `a[1]`, we keep it as `a[1]` in the expression. The value of `x` remains unchanged as per the initial state.
