Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and the list of integers \( a \).
3. The list \( a \) is sorted in descending order.
4. The variable `ans1` is initially set to the sum of all elements in the sorted list.
5. The program then iterates through the first \( x \) elements of the sorted list, subtracting twice their values from `ans1`. This simulates Bob's optimal strategy of flipping the smallest negative contributions.
6. The variable `ans2` is initialized to `ans1`.
7. The program then iterates through the first \( k \) elements of the sorted list, adding their values to `ans1` and adjusting `ans2` accordingly. This simulates Alice's optimal strategy of removing the largest positive contributions.
8. After these adjustments, `ans2` is printed, which represents the maximum possible sum of the array after both players have made their moves.

Given the logic and the steps described in the problem statement, the program appears to correctly implement the solution. The approach considers both players' optimal strategies and calculates the resulting sum accurately.

Correctness: **True**
