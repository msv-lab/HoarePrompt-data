Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[0]`. Since `i` is 0 initially and no other changes are made to `i`, its value remains 0. The exact value of `ans1` depends on its initial value and the value of `a[0]`, but it is specifically stated that `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.
