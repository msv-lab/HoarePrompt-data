Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + x + 1`. The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and `i + x + 1` must be less than `n` remain unchanged.
