Output State: **`i` is equal to `x`; `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`; `k` remains the same; `t` is decreased by `x`; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The line `ans2 = ans1` assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Since `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`, `ans2` will also be the same value.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
