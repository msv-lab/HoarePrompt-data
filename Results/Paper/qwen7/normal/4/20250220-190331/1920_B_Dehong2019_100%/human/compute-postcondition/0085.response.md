Output State: **`i` is equal to `x`, `ans1` is the initial sum of all elements in list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum value between its original value and `ans1`, `t` is decreased by `x * k`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. This means that `ans2` now holds the same value as `ans1`, which was the initial sum of all elements in list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
