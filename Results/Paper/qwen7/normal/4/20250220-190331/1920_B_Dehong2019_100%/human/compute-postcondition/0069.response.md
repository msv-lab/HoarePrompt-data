Output State: **`ans1` is the value after adding `a[i]` to the previous value of `ans1`, `i` is `x + 2`, `x` must be less than `k - 2`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1` or `i`, nor does it affect the conditions involving `x` and `n`. It only updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. Therefore, the values of `ans1`, `i`, `x`, and `n` remain the same as before, and the condition that `i + x < n` must hold true is still valid.
