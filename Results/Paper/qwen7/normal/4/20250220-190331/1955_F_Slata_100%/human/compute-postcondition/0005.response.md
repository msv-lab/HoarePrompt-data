Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is defined as `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. However, since no previous iteration is mentioned and no specific value for `i` is provided, we can assume `i` is not directly relevant to the print statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The expression inside the print statement is `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.

To evaluate this expression, let's break it down further:
- `a // 2`: Integer division of `a` by 2.
- `b // 2`: Integer division of `b` by 2.
- `c // 2`: Integer division of `c` by 2.
- `d // 2`: Integer division of `d` by 2.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not explicitly provided, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the expression.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **All Even Numbers**:
   - If `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are all even, then `a % 2 = 0`, `b % 2 = 0`, `c % 2 = 0`, and `d % 2 = 0`.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` evaluates to `0 + 0 + 0 == 3`, which is false.
   - Therefore, `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will be `0`.
   - The expression becomes `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 0`.

2. **Two Odd and Two Even Numbers**:
   - If two numbers are odd and two are even, then the sum of their remainders when divided by 2 would be `1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2` or `1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2` or similar combinations.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` evaluates to `false` in these cases.
   - Therefore, `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will be `0`.
   - The expression becomes `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 0`.

3. **One Odd and Three Even Numbers**:
   - If one number is odd and three are even, then the sum of their remainders when divided by 2 would be `1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` evaluates to `false` in these cases.
   - Therefore, `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will be `0`.
   - The expression becomes `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 0`.

4. **Three Odd and One Even Number**:
   - If three numbers are odd and one is even, then the sum of their remainders when divided by 2 would be `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` evaluates to `true` in these cases.
   - Therefore, `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will be `1`.
   - The expression becomes `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 1`.

Given the above scenarios, the expression will evaluate to either `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` (if the sum of the remainders is not 3) or `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 1` (if the sum of the remainders is 3).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the general form of the output.

Output: **a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)**
