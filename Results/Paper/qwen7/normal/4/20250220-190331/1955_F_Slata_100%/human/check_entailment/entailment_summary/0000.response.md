Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and compare them with the current implementation:

1. **Problem Requirement**: 
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve aims to maximize the number of Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program calculates `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.
   - This expression does not relate to the XOR operation or the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine the maximum number of Bob's wins, we need to consider how the XOR of the sequence changes when numbers are removed.
   - The key insight is that Bob wins if the final XOR is zero. We need to count the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s and use their properties to determine the number of Bob's wins.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If there is an odd number of 1s, the final XOR will be 1 (Alice wins).
   - If there is an even number of 1s, the final XOR can be manipulated to be 0 (Bob wins).
   - For 2s, 3s, and 4s, they do not affect the parity of the XOR directly but can be used to adjust the count of 1s.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not follow the correct logic. It simply adds up the integer divisions and a condition check, which is unrelated to the XOR operation or the optimal strategy.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
