Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It does not affect the value of `i` which was defined as `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the state of `i` remains unchanged, and it is still expressed as `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration.
