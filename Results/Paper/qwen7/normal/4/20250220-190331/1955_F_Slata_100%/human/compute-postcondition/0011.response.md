Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case consisting of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. It then returns the total count of these numbers.**

Given the constraints, the function likely takes a test case as input, which is a list or tuple of four integers, and returns the sum of these integers. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, the description focuses on what the function does with the implied input.
