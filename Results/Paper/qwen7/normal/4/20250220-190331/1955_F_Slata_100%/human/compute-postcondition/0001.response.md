Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes four space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since the actual values are not provided, the output state simply states that these variables now hold the integers entered by the user.
