Output State: `same` is an integer representing the maximum consecutive occurrences of the same element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is the current element being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop, and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, as the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `same` will hold the highest count of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`, `minn` will be the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`, showing that the loop has processed every element in the list.
