Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` and `minn` is updated to be the minimum between `minn` and `same`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is explicitly set to 1, changing its previous value of 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
