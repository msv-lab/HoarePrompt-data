Output State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is set to a value such that `i + 2 < len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`; `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
