Output State: **Postcondition: `same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` throughout the entire list, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final input integer after all iterations, `ar` is the final list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the current number being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations and moved past the last index of the list. `minn` is the smallest value of `same` found during the loop, and it is either equal to infinity or the length of the list `ar` in the if part, or `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar` in the else part.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `same` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (though it won't change since it's not modified in the loop), `n` will be the last input integer processed, `ar` will be the final list of integers, `num` will be the last number being tracked, `minn` will be the smallest value of `same` found during the loop, and `i` will be one more than the length of the list `ar`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
