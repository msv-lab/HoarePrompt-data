Output State: **Postcondition: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is increased by 1, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` becomes 3; otherwise, `same` becomes 1 and `minn` is updated to 2.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `i` is now one more than its previous value, while the other variables retain their original conditions or relationships specified in the initial state.
