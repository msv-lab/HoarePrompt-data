Postcondition: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is less than `len(ar)`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` becomes 3. Otherwise, `same` remains 1, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to be the minimum between `minn` and `same`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
