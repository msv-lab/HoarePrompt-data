Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is between 1 and len(`ar`) - 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` is equal to len(`ar`) - 1.**

The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `ar`. The other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `num`, `minn`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
