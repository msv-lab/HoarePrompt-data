Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, the new value of `i` is now `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
