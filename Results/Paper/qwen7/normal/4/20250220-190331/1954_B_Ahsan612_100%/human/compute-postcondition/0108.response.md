Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[3]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[3]` to `num`. Since `i` was previously 3, `num` is updated to the value at index 3 of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
