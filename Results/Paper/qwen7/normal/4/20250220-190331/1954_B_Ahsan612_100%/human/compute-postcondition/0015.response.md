Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `len(ar)` is greater than 1**.

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (which is infinity) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Therefore, `minn` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
