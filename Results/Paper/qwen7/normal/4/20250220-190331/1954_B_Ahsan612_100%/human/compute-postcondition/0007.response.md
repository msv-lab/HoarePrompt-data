The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `i` is currently 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**
