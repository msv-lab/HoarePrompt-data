Output State: **`same` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
