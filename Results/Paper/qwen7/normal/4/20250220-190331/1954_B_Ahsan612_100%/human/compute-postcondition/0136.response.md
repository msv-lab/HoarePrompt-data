Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` starting from `ar[0]` up to the last element processed.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num` is the current number being tracked.
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations and moved past the last index of the list.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity and `minn` is not equal to the length of `ar`.

The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` that was found during the loop's execution.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution)**
