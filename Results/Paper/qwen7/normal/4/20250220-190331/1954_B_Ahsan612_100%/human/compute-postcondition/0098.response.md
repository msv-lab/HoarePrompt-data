Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` is equal to len(`ar`) - 1.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
