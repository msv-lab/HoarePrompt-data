The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must satisfy this condition after the adjustment.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `same` is 2
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num` is equal to `ar[0]`
- `minn` is infinity
- `i` is 3
- `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is currently 3, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`**
