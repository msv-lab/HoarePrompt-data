Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` is equal to len(`ar`) - 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `num` is updated to be equal to `ar[0]`, while the other variables retain their initial values.
