Postcondition: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` becomes 3; otherwise, `same` becomes 1 and `minn` is updated to 2.
