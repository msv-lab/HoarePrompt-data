### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `num` to track the current element.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements (`minn`).

3. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The loop correctly identifies sequences of identical elements.
   - `minn` is updated to store the minimum length of such sequences.
   - If `minn` is infinite (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for identifying the minimum sequence length is correct.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when the array is already uniform) is appropriate.
   - The final check to ensure the array cannot be made non-beautiful if `minn` is infinite or equal to the array length is correct.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The initialization and updates of variables (`same`, `num`, `minn`, `i`) are consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The loop correctly iterates through the array and updates the minimum sequence length.
   - The final condition checks are correctly implemented to determine the output.

6. **Specific Test Case Evaluations:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `[2, 2, 2]`
     - The array is already uniform, so no removals are needed. Output: `-1` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 2:** `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
     - The array can be made non-beautiful by removing one element. Output: `1` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 3:** `[1]`
     - The array is trivially not beautiful since it has only one element. Output: `-1` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 4:** `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`
     - The array can be made non-beautiful by removing three elements. Output: `3` (Correct).

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. The logic and handling of edge cases are correct, and the test cases provided in the example verify the correctness of the implementation.
