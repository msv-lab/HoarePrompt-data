Output State: **`same` is 2, `minn` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is increased by 1, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`, which is 2. Since `minn` was initially infinity (or a very large number), it gets updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
