The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `ar` is a list of integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently 4, `i` must be incremented to 5 for the loop to continue. The length of the list `ar` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the start of the current iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 5, and `len(ar)` remains unchanged.

State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 5**
