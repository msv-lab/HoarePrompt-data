Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is 2, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Since `same` was either 3 or 1 initially, it will now be either 4 (if it was 3) or 2 (if it was 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
