Postcondition: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of the list `ar` if the if condition is met, otherwise `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.
