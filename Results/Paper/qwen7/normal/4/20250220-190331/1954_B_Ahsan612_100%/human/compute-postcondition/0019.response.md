Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 2.
- The code `i += 1` increments `i` by 1.
- Therefore, `i` becomes 3.
- The values of `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
