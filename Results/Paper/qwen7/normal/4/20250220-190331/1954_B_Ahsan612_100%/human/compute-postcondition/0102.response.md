Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state of variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i` is currently set to 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i < len(ar)` must be true.

3. **Check the current value of `i`**:
   - `i` is currently 1.

4. **Check the current value of `len(ar)`**:
   - We don't know the exact value of `len(ar)` from the given information, but we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 2 (since `i` starts at 1 and needs to be less than `len(ar)`).

5. **Adjust the state if necessary**:
   - Since `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)` must be at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be at least 2**
