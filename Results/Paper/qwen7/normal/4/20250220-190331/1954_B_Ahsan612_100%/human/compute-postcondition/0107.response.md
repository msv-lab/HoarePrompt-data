Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be at least 2.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
