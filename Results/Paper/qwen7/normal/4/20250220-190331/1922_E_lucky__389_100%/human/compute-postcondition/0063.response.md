Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, and `i` must be at least 2, and `len(subseq_lens)` must be at least 2; `subseq_lens` now has one additional element which is `subseq_lens[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `subseq_lens[i]` to the list `subseq_lens`. Since `i` must be at least 2 and the length of `subseq_lens` must be at least 2, `i` is a valid index for the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
