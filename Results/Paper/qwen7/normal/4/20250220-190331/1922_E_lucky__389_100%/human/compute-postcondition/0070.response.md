Based on the initial state provided:

- `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least four elements, and `ansv` has been updated to include the last three elements that were appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's iterations.
- `i` is set to the length of `subseq_lens` plus one, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
- `mx` is the maximum value found among the values in `subseq_lens`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is 0.

The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the `ansv` list.

Since `ansv` has been updated to include three additional elements from `subseq_lens`, the length of `ansv` is 3.

Output: **3**
