### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program needs to handle up to 1000 test cases, where `X` can be as large as \(10^{18}\).

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined by the lengths of its longest increasing subsequences (LIS). Specifically, if we have an array of length `n` with `k` distinct values, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using combinations.

3. **Approach in the Code**:
   - The code attempts to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the lengths of the LIS needed to achieve the desired count of increasing subsequences.
   - For each bit position in the binary representation of `X`, it tries to add a new value to the array, ensuring the count of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when `X` is 2 and prints `[0]`.
   - For other values of `X`, it constructs an array by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - However, the logic for constructing the array is flawed. The code constructs an array with a fixed number of distinct values and appends elements based on the binary representation of `X`. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 correctly.
   - For larger values of `X`, the code constructs arrays that do not necessarily meet the requirement. For example, consider `X = 13`. The binary representation of 13 is `1101`, which suggests the array should have elements corresponding to the lengths 3, 2, and 1. However, the code constructs an array with elements `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]`, which does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs the length of the array followed by the array itself.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, but the content of the array may be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for generating an array with a specified number of increasing subsequences. While it handles the edge case of `X` being 2 correctly, it fails to construct arrays for larger values of `X` that meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
