You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, and `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current value of `x` at the start of each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `mx` will hold the maximum length of the subsequence found during the loop's iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 after all iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain a list of lengths of subsequences found, and `i` will be the highest power of 2 that fits into the current value of `x` at the beginning of each iteration.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`, `len(subseq_lens)` is at least 4, and `ansv` is a list that now contains three additional elements which are `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain at least four elements (since it starts with at least two elements and the loop appends one more element per iteration). The variable `ansv` will have been updated to include the last three elements that were appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will be set to the length of `subseq_lens` plus one, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The value of `mx` will be the highest value found in `subseq_lens`, and `t` remains within the specified range.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 3, `ansv` contains at least 7 elements, `mx` is the maximum value found among the values in `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains at least 7 elements, and `ansv` includes the last three elements appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's iterations.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
