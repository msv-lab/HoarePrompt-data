Output State: `mx` is the maximum value found among `i - 1` during each iteration of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is 0 (since the loop continues until `x` becomes 0), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of the highest powers of 2 subtracted from `x` in each iteration, and `i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` at the start of each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `mx` will hold the maximum length of the highest power of 2 that was subtracted from `x` in any iteration, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the sequence of lengths of the highest powers of 2 subtracted from `x` in each iteration, and `i` will be the highest power of 2 that was considered in the last iteration before `x` became 0.
