Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and -1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 16, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value -1, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and the condition on `t` remain unchanged.
