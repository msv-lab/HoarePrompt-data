Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is at least 16, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values -1 and `i - 1`, `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code appends `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. Initially, `subseq_lens` contains only the value `-1`. After appending `i - 1`, `subseq_lens` now contains `-1` and `i - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
