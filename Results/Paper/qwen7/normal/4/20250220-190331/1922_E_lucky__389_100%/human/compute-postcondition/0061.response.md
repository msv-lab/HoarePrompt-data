Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, and `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current value of `x` at the start of each iteration; `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1`.**

The code creates a list `ansv` that contains integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence found during the loop's iterations. The values of `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
