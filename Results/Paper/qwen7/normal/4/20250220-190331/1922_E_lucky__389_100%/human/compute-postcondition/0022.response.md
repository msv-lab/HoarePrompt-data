Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and \(x \geq 2\) and \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 2\), `subseq_lens` is a list containing `[i - 1]`, `x` is updated to \(x - 2^{(i - 1)}\)**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decreased by \(2^{(i - 1)}\). All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens` are preserved, but `x` is now updated to its new value after subtracting \(2^{(i - 1)}\).
