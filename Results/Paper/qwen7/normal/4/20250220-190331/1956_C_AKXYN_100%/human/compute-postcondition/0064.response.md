Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 2

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the code uses string formatting. Since `i` is 1, it will replace `%d` with `1`. So, this part becomes `'1 1'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function into separate arguments. Since `n` is 2, `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2]`. Unpacking this sequence results in `1 2`.

4. **Combining the Results**:
   - When we combine these parts, the final string to be printed is `'1 1 1 2'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 1 1 2**
