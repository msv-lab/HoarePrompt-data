Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n-2`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 2.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n+1` into separate arguments for the print function.

4. **Determine Values**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 4.
     - If `n = 4`, then `i = n - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.

5. **Construct the Output**:
   - With `i = 2`, the formatted string becomes `'2 2'`.
   - The range `range(1, n + 1)` with `n = 4` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - When unpacked, this range will be printed as `1 2 3 4`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - Combining both parts, the print statement will output: `'2 2 1 2 3 4'`.

Output: **2 2 1 2 3 4**
