Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation based on `t` and `n`, but the exact nature of the operation is not detailed here. The function returns the result of these operations for all test cases.**

Note: The exact operations to be performed on `t` and `n` within each test case are not specified in the given information.
