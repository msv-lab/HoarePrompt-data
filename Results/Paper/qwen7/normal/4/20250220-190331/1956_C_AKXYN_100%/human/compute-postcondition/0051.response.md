Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 1.
   - `n` is initially 2.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Check the initial value of `i` relative to `n`**:
   - Initially, `i` is 1 and `n` is 2. Since 1 < 2, the loop will execute at least once.

5. **Adjust the states if necessary**: Given that the loop will execute based on the current values of `i` and `n`, no adjustments are needed because the loop will start with `i` being 1 and `n` being 2, and `i` will be incremented within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted (or confirmed) for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be 2.

Since the loop will execute based on these values, no further adjustments are required.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 2**
