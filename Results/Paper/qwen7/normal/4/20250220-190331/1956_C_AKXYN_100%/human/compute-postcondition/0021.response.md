Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Values:**
   - `res` is explicitly given as 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Since no specific value for `t` is provided, it remains as a range of possible values.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is: `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`
   - `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 1. So, this part becomes `'1 1'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object from 1 to `n + 1`, where `n` is 3. This results in the sequence `1, 2, 3`.

3. **Combining the Parts:**
   - Combining these parts, the print statement will output: `'1 1'` followed by the sequence `1, 2, 3`.

Output: **'1 1 1 2 3'**
