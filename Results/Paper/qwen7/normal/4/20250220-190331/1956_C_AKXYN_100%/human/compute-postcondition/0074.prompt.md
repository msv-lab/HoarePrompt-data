You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        
        print(res, n << 1)
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 0; `n` is 1; `mat` is [[1]]; `res` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given that `n` is initially set to 1, the loop will run only once with `i` starting from 1 and decrementing to 0. During this single iteration, the value of `res` is not modified, so it remains 0. The matrix `mat` is initialized as a list containing a single list `[1]` since `n` is 1. After the loop completes, `i` will be 0, `n` will be 1, `mat` will be `[[1]]`, and `res` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation based on `t` and `n`, but the exact nature of the operation is not detailed here. The function returns the result of these operations for all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
