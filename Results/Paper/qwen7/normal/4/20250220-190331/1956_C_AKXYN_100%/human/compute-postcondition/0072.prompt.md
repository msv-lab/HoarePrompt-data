Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
    print(res, n << 1)
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 9, `i` is 0.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop increments `res` by \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) in each iteration. Starting from `i` being 9, the loop continues until `i` reaches 0. Given that the initial value of `res` is 204 and the loop adds values based on the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\), after 9 iterations (from `i` = 9 to `i` = 0), `res` remains 204 because no further additions are made once `i` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `res` is still 204, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 9, and `i` is 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 0; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given `n` is 2, the loop will run twice. Let's calculate the value of `res` step-by-step based on the provided loop code and the operations described:

1. **First iteration (i = 2):**
   - Print statements are executed, but they do not affect the value of `res`.
   - No changes are made to `res`, `n`, `mat`, or `i`.

2. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   - Print statements are executed, but they do not affect the value of `res`.
   - No changes are made to `res`, `n`, `mat`, or `i`.

Since the loop runs twice, `i` will be decremented to 0 after the loop completes. The other variables (`n`, `mat`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states because they are not modified within the loop. Thus, the final state is `i` is 0; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
