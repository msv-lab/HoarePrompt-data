Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 204
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be 3
- `i` is 2

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. Since `i` is 2, this part becomes `'1 2'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into separate arguments. Since `n` is 3, `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`, which is then unpacked into `1 2 3`.

Combining these parts, the `print` statement will output:
```
1 2 1 2 3
```

Output: **1 2 1 2 3**
