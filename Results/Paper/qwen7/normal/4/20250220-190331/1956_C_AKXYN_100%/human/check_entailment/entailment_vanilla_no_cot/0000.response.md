Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the constraints.

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The function initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to its optimal value for maximizing the sum.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the matrix elements is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i+1)(2i+1) \). This formula is derived from the pattern of setting each row and column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Operations Execution**: The function prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \). It then executes the operations in reverse order, ensuring that each row and column is set to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Output Format**: The function outputs the results in the required format, including the type of operation (1 or 2), the row or column index, and the permutation used.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the function correctly generates the desired output. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
