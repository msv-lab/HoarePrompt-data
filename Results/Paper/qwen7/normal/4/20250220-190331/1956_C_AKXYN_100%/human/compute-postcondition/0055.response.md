Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `res` is the original value of `res` plus `(i + 1) * (2 * (i + 1) + 1)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is now `i + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Update the state:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was `i` before, it will become `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (from the previous `i`).
   - `n` must remain greater than `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
