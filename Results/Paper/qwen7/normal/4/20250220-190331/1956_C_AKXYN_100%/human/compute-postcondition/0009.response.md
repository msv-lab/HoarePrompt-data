Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `res` is 6 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (this variable is part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is part of the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, `n` must still satisfy the condition \(i < n\), meaning `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

The final state is:
State: **`res` is 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
