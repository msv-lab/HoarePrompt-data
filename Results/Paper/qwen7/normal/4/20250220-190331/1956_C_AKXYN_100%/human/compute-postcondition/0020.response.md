Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `n` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 204
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be 3 (this is a constant value within the loop)
   - `i` is 2

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` (which is 3) and decrements by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `res` remains 204 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains 3.
   - `i` changes to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 3, `i` is 1**
