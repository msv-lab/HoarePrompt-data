Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input and processes it correctly.
2. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
3. It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).
4. It iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current amount and the target amount remains non-negative. If it ever becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'No'.
5. If the loop completes without finding any negative cumulative difference, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
