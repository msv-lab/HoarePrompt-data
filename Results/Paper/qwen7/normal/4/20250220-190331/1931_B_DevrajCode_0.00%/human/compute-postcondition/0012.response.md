Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `container` is increased by `water - target`
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`
- `target` is the result of `total_water // n`
- `container` is greater than or equal to 0

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for water in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `water`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `water` must be an element of the list `a`.
3. **Update the State**:
   - `container` is already updated by the previous iteration.
   - `total_water` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `target` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `water` will be the next element from the list `a`.

### Updated State
At the start of the next iteration, `water` will be the next element from the list `a`.

**State:**
- `container` is increased by `water - target`
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`
- `target` is the result of `total_water // n`
- `water` is the next element from the list `a`

Since `water` is the only variable that changes with each iteration, the updated state is:

**State: **`container` is increased by `water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, `target` is the result of `total_water // n`, `water` is the next element from the list `a`**.
