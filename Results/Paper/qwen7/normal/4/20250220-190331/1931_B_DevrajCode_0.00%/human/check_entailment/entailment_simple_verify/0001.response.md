### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is possible to evenly distribute the water among all containers. This is because the average amount of water per container would be an integer.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into `n` and the list `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if the distribution is possible.
   - In `func_1`, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It iterates through the list `a` and keeps track of the difference between the current water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference makes the cumulative difference negative, it means the distribution is not possible, and it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning 'No' immediately.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the distribution is possible by ensuring that the cumulative difference never goes negative.

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the total water is divisible by `n` and ensures that the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount never goes negative.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code accurately reflects the state of the program at key points.
   - The state before the function call is correctly described as `n` being a positive integer representing the number of containers, and `a` being a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - The state after the function call is correctly described, showing how the `container` variable accumulates the net difference between each element in `a` and the `target` value. If the `container` becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem, and the annotated code accurately describes the program's state at key points.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
