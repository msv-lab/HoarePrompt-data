Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `container` is increased by `water - target`.
   - `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`.
   - `target` is the result of `total_water // n`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `water` in the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `water` and `a`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `a`, the next value of `water` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - After processing each element `water` in the list `a`, the `container` is updated by adding `water - target` to it.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `container` will be updated by adding the current `water - target` to its previous value.
   - `water` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `a` remains the same list as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - `container` will be the previous value of `container` plus `water - target`.
   - `water` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`container` is the previous value of `container` plus `water - target`, `water` is the next element in the list `a`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, `target` is the result of `total_water // n`**.
