### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input and Processing:**
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes it into `n` and `a`.
   - This part is correct and handled properly.

2. **Calculating Total Water and Target Amount:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total water is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - This check is correct because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Iterating Through Containers:**
   - The program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list `a` and maintains a running total of the differences between each element and the target.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic implemented in the `func_1` function is sound. The running total `container` keeps track of the net difference between the current distribution and the target distribution.
   - If the running total ever goes negative, it means there is no way to redistribute the water to achieve the target distribution without some container having less than the target amount.
   - If the running total remains non-negative, it means the water can be redistributed to achieve the target distribution.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all containers already have the same amount of water, the running total will remain zero, and the function will return 'Yes'.
   - If there is even a small imbalance, the running total will eventually go negative, and the function will return 'No'.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the logic implemented.
