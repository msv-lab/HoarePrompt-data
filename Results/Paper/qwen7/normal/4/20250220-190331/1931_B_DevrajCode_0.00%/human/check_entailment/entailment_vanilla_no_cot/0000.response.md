Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Parsing Data**: It correctly parses the number of test cases and the array of water amounts for each test case.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Total Water Calculation**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it returns 'No'.
   - **Target Amount**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by `n`.
   - **Container Balance Check**: It iterates through the array of water amounts and keeps track of the balance between the current total and the target total. If at any point the balance goes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water amounts, and it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the constraints and examples provided.
