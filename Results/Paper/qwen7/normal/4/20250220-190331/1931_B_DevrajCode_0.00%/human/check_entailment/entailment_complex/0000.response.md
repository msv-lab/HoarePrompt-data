Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the given operation.
2. The key insight is that since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container is an integer. This means that if we can redistribute the water, each container should end up with this average amount.
3. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the total water and the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
4. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the target. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means that it is impossible to redistribute the water to meet the target without some container having less than the target amount.
5. The function correctly returns 'Yes' if the running total never goes negative and 'No' if it does go negative.

Given the above analysis, the logic implemented in the function is correct according to the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
