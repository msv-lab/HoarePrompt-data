### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is possible to achieve this distribution.

2. **Key Insight**: The provided program correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. However, the program's approach to verifying the possibility of even distribution is flawed. The program uses a running total (`container`) to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference makes the cumulative difference negative, it returns 'No'. This approach is incorrect because it does not fully capture the essence of the problem.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into `n` and the list `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if the distribution is possible.
   - In `func_1`, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It iterates through the list `a` and keeps track of the difference between the current water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference makes the cumulative difference negative, it means the distribution is not possible, and it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning 'No' immediately.
   - However, the program's approach to verifying the possibility of even distribution is incorrect. The running total (`container`) does not accurately reflect the possibility of redistribution. For example, consider the case where `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 3`. The target is `2`. The program would calculate the differences as `[1-2, 2-2, 3-2] = [-1, 0, 1]`. The cumulative difference would be `-1 + 0 + 1 = 0`, which is non-negative, but it is not possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have exactly 2 units of water.

5. **Conclusion**: The program logic is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that a non-negative cumulative difference guarantees the possibility of even distribution. The correct approach would be to verify that the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the target amount, which is not captured by the current implementation.
