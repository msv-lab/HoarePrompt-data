Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is taken for `a` instead. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `a` now holds the integer input provided by the user.
