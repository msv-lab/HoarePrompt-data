You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it prints 'YES' if \(n\) equals \(m\), 'NO' if \(n\) is less than \(m\), 'Yes' if both \(n\) and \(m\) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `a = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `a` times to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `(b, c) = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers `b` and `c` for each test case.
   - `q = (b, c)` stores these values in a tuple `q`, which is not used further in the code.
   
3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `b` equals the desired number of cubes `c`. If true, prints 'YES'.
   - `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`. If true, prints 'NO'.
   - `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks if the number of moves `b` is even when the total number of test cases `a` is also even. If true, prints 'Yes'. This condition is problematic because `a` should not be involved here; we need to check if `b` can reach `c`.
   - `else:` prints 'No' if none of the above conditions are met.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The first condition (`if b == c`) is correct and handles the case where the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes.
- The second condition (`elif b < c`) is incorrect because it incorrectly concludes that it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- The third condition (`elif a % 2 == b % 2`) is irrelevant and incorrect. It checks if the number of moves `b` is even when the total number of test cases `a` is even, which does not help in determining if `b` can reach `c`.
- The fourth condition (`else`) should handle the remaining cases, but due to the incorrect conditions before it, this might not cover all necessary scenarios.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even because each move (putting or removing a cube) changes the number of cubes by 1, which means the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves minus the final number of cubes.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the misuse of conditions and the irrelevant use of `a`. The corrected program checks the parity of the difference between `b` and `c`.
