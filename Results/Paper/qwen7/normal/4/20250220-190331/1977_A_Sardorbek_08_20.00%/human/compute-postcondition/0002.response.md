Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `b` and `c`. The initial conditions for `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and `a` is still at least 1. The values of `b` and `c` are the integers entered by the user.
