Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is the final value of `a` after all iterations of the loop, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is the total number of iterations which equals `a`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `a` will be the final value it reaches after all iterations, `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered through the input during the loop, `q` will contain these last values of `b` and `c`, and `i` will be equal to `a`, representing the total number of iterations performed by the loop.
