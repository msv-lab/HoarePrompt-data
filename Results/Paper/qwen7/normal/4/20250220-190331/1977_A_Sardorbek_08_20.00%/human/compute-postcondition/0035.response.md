Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `q = b, c` simply reassigns the tuple `q` to contain the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and `a` must be at least 1, and `i` is `i + 1` (though the exact value of `i` is not specified) are still valid.
