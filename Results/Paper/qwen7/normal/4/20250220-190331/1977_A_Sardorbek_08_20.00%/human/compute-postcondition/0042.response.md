Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`. The only difference is the condition `b == c`, which is checked in the if part, but since the else part does not alter these variables either, the overall postcondition stays unchanged.
