Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` and `c` are integers from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` and `c` remain unchanged. If `b` is not equal to `c`, then `b` remains unchanged if it is less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then no changes are made to `b` and `c` if the current value of `a` modulo 2 is equal to the current value of `b` modulo 2, otherwise no changes are made either.
