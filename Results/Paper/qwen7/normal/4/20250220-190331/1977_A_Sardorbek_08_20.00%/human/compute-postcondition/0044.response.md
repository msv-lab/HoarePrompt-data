Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each t, two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). It returns different outputs based on the values of n and m for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to process a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t` and pairs of values for `n` and `m`. The exact nature of the output for each case is not specified here, but it involves evaluating `n` and `m` within the given constraints and producing a result accordingly.
