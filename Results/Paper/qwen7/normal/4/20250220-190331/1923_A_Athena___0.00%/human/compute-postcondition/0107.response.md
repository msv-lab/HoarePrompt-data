Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(len(a))`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as `res` is 2 and `i` is 1, if `a[i]` equals 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 1 and `i` remains 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(len(a))`, the value of `i` will increment by 1 at each iteration.
   - The current value of `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `res` will remain unchanged unless `a[2]` is 0. However, since we are only asked to state the modified states based on the loop head, we do not need to consider the condition `a[2] == 0` here.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`res` is 2, `i` is 2**
