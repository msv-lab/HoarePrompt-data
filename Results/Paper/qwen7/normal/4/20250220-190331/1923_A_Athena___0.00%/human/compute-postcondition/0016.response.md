Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, `a` contained one element which was 0. After executing `a.pop()`, `a` becomes an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
