Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list without any leading zeros, `res` is 1, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is 0, then `res` is set to 1. There is no else part in the code, so the conditions do not change if the element is not 0.
