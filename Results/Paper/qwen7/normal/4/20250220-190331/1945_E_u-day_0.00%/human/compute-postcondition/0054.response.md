Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an integer based on the value of k and the elements in arr.**

This means the function `func_3` takes in the length of a permutation `n`, an integer `k` within the range of 1 to `n`, and a list `arr` containing `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then processes these inputs to produce and return a specific integer value, likely related to the position or value at index `k-1` in the list `arr`.
