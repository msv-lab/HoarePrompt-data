Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a way to rearrange the permutation such that the element `x` is at the `l` position after performing binary search. The binary search algorithm is applied with the intention to find `x` in the permutation, but the given code does not correctly implement the binary search to achieve the desired result.
2. The code provided in `func_3()` does not actually perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it performs a binary search on the current permutation without modifying it, which does not meet the requirement of the problem.
3. The problem statement specifies that the permutation should be rearranged using at most 2 swaps, but the provided code does not include any logic to perform these swaps.
4. The output format and logic in the provided code do not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the output should describe the swaps needed to place `x` at the `l` position, but the given code does not generate such outputs.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
