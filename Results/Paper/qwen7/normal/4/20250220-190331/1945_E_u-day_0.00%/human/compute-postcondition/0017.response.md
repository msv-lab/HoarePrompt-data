Output State: **The final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`). The variable `pos` will be set to the index where the value `k` was found in the list `arr`, if `k` exists in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr` throughout the entire loop, `pos` will remain `-1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
