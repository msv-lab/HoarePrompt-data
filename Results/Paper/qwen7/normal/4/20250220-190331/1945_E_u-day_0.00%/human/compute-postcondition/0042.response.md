Output State: **`low` is equal to `mid`, `high` retains its original value, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `st` retains its original value, and `st` now contains the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code sets `low` to the value of `mid`. Since `mid` was originally calculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `low` now holds this value. The other variables (`high`, `mid`, `st`) retain their original values, with `st` still containing the value of `mid`.
