Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.**

The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, it remains unchanged. The values of `low` and `high` are also unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated set `st` containing the value of `mid`.
