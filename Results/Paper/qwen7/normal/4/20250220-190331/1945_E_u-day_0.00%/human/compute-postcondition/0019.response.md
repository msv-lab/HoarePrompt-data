Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, the final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of `low`, `high`, `i`, `n`, or `pos`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial or previously updated states.
