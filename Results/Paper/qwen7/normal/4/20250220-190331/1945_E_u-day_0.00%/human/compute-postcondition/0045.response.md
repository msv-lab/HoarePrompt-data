Output State: `low` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `n-1` such that for all integers `m` where `low <= m < high`, `arr[m] <= k`. `high` is the smallest integer greater than `low` such that for all integers `m` where `low < m <= high`, `arr[m] > k`. `mid` is the last computed midpoint value during the loop's execution, which is `(low + high) // 2`. `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `low` will point to the position just before the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, or `n-1` if no such element exists. `high` will be the next position, or `n` if it exceeds the array bounds. The set `st` will contain all the indices of elements checked during the binary search process.
