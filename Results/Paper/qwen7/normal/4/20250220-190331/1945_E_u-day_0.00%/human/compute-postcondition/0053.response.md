Postcondition: **`low` and `high` are consecutive integers such that `low + 1 == high`. `st` is a set containing all the unique midpoints calculated during the loop iterations. `mid` is the last midpoint calculated, which is `(low + high) // 2`. `arr[mid]` is either equal to `k` or either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the binary search process.**
