Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `func_2()`: This function converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: This function is supposed to implement the logic to find the position of `k` in the permutation and perform swaps if necessary to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input using `func_1()`.
   - **Finding Position**: It finds the index `pos` where the value `k` is located in the permutation `arr`.
   - **Binary Search Logic**:
     - The function initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n - 1`, respectively.
     - It uses a set `st` to store mid-values, but this set is never used in the logic.
     - It performs a binary search to find the correct position for `k`.
     - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and performs a swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3()` is incorrect. The purpose of binary search here is to find the correct position for `k` such that `p_l` becomes `k`. However, the binary search is not correctly implemented to achieve this.
   - The binary search should aim to place `k` at the `l` position, not just find its current position.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program only performs one swap, which is insufficient in many cases. As per the problem statement, up to two swaps are allowed, but the current implementation only handles one swap.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is not consistent with the problem requirements. The program should output the number of swaps and the pairs of indices for each swap.

### Correctness Analysis

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
