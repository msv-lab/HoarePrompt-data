Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `low` and `high`.

3. **Check the current state of `low` and `high`**:
   - According to the postcondition, if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `n-1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - We need to ensure that either `low` is less than `high - 1` or both `low` and `high` are such that the condition holds.

5. **Analyze the possible states**:
   - If `low` is 0 and `high` is `mid`, then `low + 1 < high` becomes `0 + 1 < mid`, which simplifies to `1 < mid`. This means `mid` must be greater than 1.
   - If `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1`, then `low + 1 < high` becomes `mid + 1 < n-1`, which simplifies to `mid < n-2`. This means `mid` must be less than `n-2`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied. Given the postconditions, we can conclude that `low` and `high` must be such that they satisfy the condition `low + 1 < high`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `low` and `high` to ensure that `low + 1 < high`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0 and `high` is `mid` with `mid > 1`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1` with `mid < n-2`**
