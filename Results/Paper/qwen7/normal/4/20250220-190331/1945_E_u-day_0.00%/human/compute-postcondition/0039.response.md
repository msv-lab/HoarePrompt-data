Output State: **`low` retains its original value, `high` retains its original value, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, and `st` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `low`, `high`, or `st`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
