Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not ensure that the binary search algorithm will place the target value `k` at the `l` position after the algorithm completes. Let's analyze the issue with an example:

Consider the test case:
- \( n = 6 \)
- \( x = 3 \)
- Permutation: \( [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6] \)

The function `func_3` is supposed to rearrange the permutation such that after performing the binary search, \( p_l \) is equal to \( x \). However, the current implementation only searches for the target value and prints the index of its occurrence if it exists. It does not perform any swaps to ensure that the target value is at the correct position.

In the given permutation, the target value \( x = 3 \) is at index 1. The binary search will not move this value to the start of the array because the function does not perform any swaps. Therefore, the binary search will not place the target value at the desired position.

To fix this, the function needs to identify the correct positions to swap to bring the target value to the start of the array. The current implementation does not achieve this, making the program incorrect.
