Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()` correctly parses the input for each test case, returning a map object with the first two integers being `n` and `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the permutation `p`.
   - `func_2()` converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list, which is necessary for further processing.

2. **Main Function (`func_3()`) Analysis**:
   - `func_3()` is supposed to find the correct positions to swap elements in the permutation so that the binary search will find the target value `x` at the start of the search.
   - The function first finds the initial position of `x` in the permutation using a linear scan.
   - It then performs a binary search-like process to identify the correct position to place `x` at the start of the search range.
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the correct positions are identified for swaps.
   - The function handles both cases where `x` is found and not found in the permutation, printing the appropriate number of swaps and their indices.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic correctly narrows down the range to find the correct position for `x`.
   - The set `st` keeps track of all midpoints visited during the binary search process, which is not strictly necessary but does not affect correctness.
   - The function ensures that the correct number of swaps (at most 2) is performed to place `x` at the start of the search range.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The function prints the correct number of swaps and their indices, ensuring that the binary search will find `x` at the start of the search range.
   - The logic for handling the case where `x` is not found in the permutation is also correct, as it identifies the correct positions for the swaps.
