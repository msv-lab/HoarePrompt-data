Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, the final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` retain their initial values. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `n-1`. `st` continues to contain the value of `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` retain their original values. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is 0 and `high` is `mid`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `low` is `mid`, `high` is `mid` with `mid > 1`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1` with `mid < n-2`. `mid` is still defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` retain their original values except for `mid` which is updated to either (`low` + `high`) // 2 based on the condition `arr[mid] > k`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is updated to (`low` + `mid`). Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
