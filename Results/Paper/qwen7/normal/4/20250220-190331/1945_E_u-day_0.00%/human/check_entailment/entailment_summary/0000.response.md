Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at index \(l\).
- The given code has three functions:
  1. `func_1()` reads the input and returns a map object containing the integers parsed from the user input.
  2. `func_2()` converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
  3. `func_3()` is supposed to find the correct positions for the swaps to make sure the binary search works correctly.

- Let's analyze `func_3()`:
  - It first finds the position of \(x\) in the array.
  - Then it performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position to place \(x\) such that the binary search can find it.
  - However, the logic in `func_3()` does not actually perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the array. Instead, it just prints the indices of the potential swap positions without actually making the swaps.

- Given the problem statement, the function should perform the swaps and print the results accordingly. But since `func_3()` does not perform the swaps, it fails to meet the requirement of the problem.

- Therefore, the given code is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirement of performing the necessary swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
