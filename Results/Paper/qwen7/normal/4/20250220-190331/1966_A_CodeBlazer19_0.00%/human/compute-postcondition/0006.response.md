Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()), `i` is `t`, `n` is the first integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the second integer input from the user split by space**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user, separated by a space, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `k` and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still equal to `t`.
