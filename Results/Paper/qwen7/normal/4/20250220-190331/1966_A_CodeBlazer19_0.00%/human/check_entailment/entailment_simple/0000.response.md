Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply prints `k - 1` for every test case without considering the actual distribution of card values. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations. The logic should involve counting how many unique card values exist and applying the operation optimally.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`5 3 4 1 1 4 4`), the expected output is 2, but the program outputs 2 (which is `k - 1`). This is correct for this specific case due to the distribution of cards, but it doesn't handle other cases correctly.
   - For the second test case (`1 10 7`), the expected output is 1, but the program outputs 9 (which is `k - 1` for the last test case). This is clearly incorrect because only one card is present initially.
   - For the third test case (`7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`), the expected output is 1, but the program outputs 1 (which is `k - 1` for the last test case). Again, this is incorrect because the operations should reduce the number of cards more effectively.

3. **General Incorrectness**: The program does not account for the optimal strategy of reducing the number of cards by merging groups of `k` identical cards into smaller groups, which could result in fewer cards remaining.

Given these points, the program is not solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
