Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`
   - `cur` is 1
   - `i` is `R[0] + 1`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `N`.

4. **Check the current value of `i` and `N`**:
   - `i` is currently `R[0] + 1`
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `N`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `R[0] + 1`, for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`**
