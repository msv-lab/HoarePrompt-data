Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `ans` is updated to the original `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` if the `else` part is executed. If the `if` part is executed, `cur` is `cur - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. The other conditions and the value of `ans` depend on whether the `if` or `else` part of the conditional statement is executed, but since the code only changes `nums_left`, the output state reflects this change while keeping the conditions for the `if` and `else` parts as described.
