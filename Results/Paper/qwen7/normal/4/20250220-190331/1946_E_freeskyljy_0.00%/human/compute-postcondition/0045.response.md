Output State: `nums_left` is 0, `i` is 0, and `ans` is the result of multiplying `ans` by `nums_left` (which is 0) modulo `MOD` for the remaining iterations, making `ans` 0.

Explanation: Since `nums_left` starts as `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 2 with each iteration, after `L[-1] - 2` iterations, `nums_left` will become 0. The loop continues until `i` reaches 1, which means it will run exactly `L[-1]` times. After `L[-1] - 2` iterations, both `nums_left` and `i` will be 0. For the remaining iterations, since `nums_left` is 0, the multiplication `ans * nums_left % MOD` will always result in 0, so `ans` will eventually become 0.
