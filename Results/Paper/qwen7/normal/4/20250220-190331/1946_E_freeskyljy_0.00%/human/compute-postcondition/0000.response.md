Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state but not affected by the code execution. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are now specific integers obtained from the input, but their exact values are not known without further input.
