Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is `R[0] + 2`, and `i` is `R[1]`.**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was equal to `R[0] + 1`. After incrementing, `cur` becomes `R[0] + 2`. The values of `ans`, `nums_left`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
