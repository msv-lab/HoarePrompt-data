The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `i < N`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must satisfy this condition. Let's analyze the current state:

- `ans` is 0 (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3` (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `cur` is either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2` (this state does not directly affect the loop condition)
- `i` is `R[1] + 2` (this state directly affects the loop condition)
- `i` is not equal to `R[cur]` (this state does not affect the loop condition)
- `R[1] + 1 < N` (this state does not directly affect the loop condition)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. Given that `i` is currently `R[1] + 2`, the next value of `i` should be `R[1] + 3` to ensure `i < N`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is `R[1] + 3`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N**
