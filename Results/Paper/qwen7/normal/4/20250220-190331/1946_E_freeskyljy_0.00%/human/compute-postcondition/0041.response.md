Postcondition: `nums_left` is decreased by either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `i` is updated to `L[-1] - 2` or `L[-1] - 3` based on the condition, `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration and either remains unchanged or is updated to `ans * (nums_left % MOD)` as per the condition, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3.
