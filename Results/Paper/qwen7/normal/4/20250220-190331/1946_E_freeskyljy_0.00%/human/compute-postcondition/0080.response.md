Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `-1`, `cur` is `N`, `i` is `N`. 

Explanation: Since the condition `M2 > 1` does not apply (as it is not specified whether `M2` is greater than 1 or not, but we assume it is not for the else part), the else part does not execute. Therefore, `ans` remains 0. The value of `nums_left` is calculated as `N - R[0] - 1 - (N - R[0]) - 1 = -1`. The value of `cur` becomes `R[0] + (N - R[0])` after the loop completes, and `i` becomes `N` after the loop increments from `R[0] + 1` to `N`.
