Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left % MOD)` if `i` does not equal `L[cur]`; otherwise, `nums_left` is decreased by 3, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, and `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration with `L[-1]` being greater than 3.**

This means that regardless of whether `i` equals `L[cur]` or not, `nums_left` is decreased by 1. If `i` does not equal `L[cur]`, then `i` is set to `L[-1] - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left % MOD)`. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `nums_left` is further decreased by 2, `i` is set to `L[-1] - 3`, and `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration with `L[-1]` being greater than 3.
