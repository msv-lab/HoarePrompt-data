Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 3, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `cur -= 1` decreases the value of `cur` by 1. Given that initially `i` was defined as `L[-1] - 2`, after executing `cur -= 1`, `i` becomes `L[-1] - 3`. Similarly, since `nums_left` was already decreased by 2, it is now decreased by an additional 1, making it decreased by 3 in total. The condition that `L[-1]` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration, which also remains unchanged in terms of its update mechanism but reflects the new value of `cur`.
