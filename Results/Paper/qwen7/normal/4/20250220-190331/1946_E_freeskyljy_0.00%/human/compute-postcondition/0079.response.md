Output State: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) - 1`, `cur` is `R[0] + (N - R[0])`, `i` is `N`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `N` because it starts from `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `N`. For each iteration, `nums_left` decreases by 1, so after `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) - 1`. The value of `cur` will be `R[0] + (N - R[0])` because it increments by 1 for each iteration unless `i` equals `R[cur]`, but since `i` will eventually reach `N`, `cur` will not increment any further. `ans` remains 0 as there is no condition within the loop that changes its value from 0.
