Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `-1`, `cur` is `N`, `i` is `N`. 

Explanation: Given the initial state where `ans` is 0 and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, the if statement checks if `M2 > 1`. If true, the loop runs until `i` becomes `N`, decrementing `nums_left` and incrementing `cur` and `i` accordingly. Since `i` starts from `R[0] + 1` and goes up to `N`, `nums_left` will be decremented by `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, resulting in `nums_left` becoming `-1`. The value of `cur` will be `N` because it increments by 1 for each iteration and does not change once `i` reaches `N`. The value of `i` will also be `N` after the loop completes. `ans` remains 0 as there is no condition within the loop that changes its value.
