Output State: **`ans` is 0 * (`N - R[0] - 3`) % `MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is `R[1] + 3`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. Since `ans` is initially 0, `0 * nums_left % MOD` is still 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
