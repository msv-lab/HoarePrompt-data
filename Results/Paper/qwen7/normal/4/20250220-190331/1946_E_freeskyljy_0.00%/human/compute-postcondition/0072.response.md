Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 3`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N**.

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`. After incrementing `cur` by 1, it becomes either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
