The loop condition is `i < N`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must satisfy this condition. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `ans` is 0
- `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`
- `cur` is either `R[0] + 2` or 1
- `i` is either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`
- `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. The current values of `i` are either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`. We need to ensure that whichever value `i` takes, it is still less than `N`.

Let's consider both possible values of `i`:

1. If `i = R[1] + 1`, then for the loop to continue, `R[1] + 1 < N`.
2. If `i = R[0] + 2`, then for the loop to continue, `R[0] + 2 < N`.

Since we need to ensure the loop can definitely execute one more time, we must set `i` to a value that guarantees `i < N`. Given that `i` can be either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`, we need to ensure that the smallest possible value of `i` (which is `R[1] + 1`) is still less than `N`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `R[1] + 1 < N`.

State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 2` or 1, `i` is either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N`**
