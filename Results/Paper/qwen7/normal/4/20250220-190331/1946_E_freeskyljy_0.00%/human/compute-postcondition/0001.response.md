Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `L`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
