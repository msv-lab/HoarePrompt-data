Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `c` equals 2, then `i` remains 1. Otherwise, the condition `a[i] > x` does not apply, and `i` remains 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 2) and `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The value of `c` does not affect the increment of `i` because the loop will run regardless of the value of `c` as long as the condition `i < n` holds true.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**.
