You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- \( n - 1 \) if the loop completes without finding any indices where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating.
- \( k - 1 \) if the first index found where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating is 0.
- The first index found minus 1 if there is exactly one index greater than the specified cow's rating and it is not 0.
- The maximum of \( k - \text{index} \) and \( \text{index} - 1 \) if there is exactly one index greater than the specified cow's rating and it is 0 or less than or equal to \( k \).
- The minimum of the second index minus 1 and \( k - 1 \) if there are exactly two indices where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating and the first index is 0.
- The maximum of \( \text{index}_0 - 1 \) and \( \text{index}_1 - \text{index}_0 \) if there are exactly two indices where the rating is greater than the specified cow's rating and the first index is not 0.
- The maximum of \( \text{index}_0 - 1 \) and \( k - \text{index}_0 \) if there is exactly one index greater than the specified cow's rating and it is greater than \( k \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the cow at position `k` can potentially win more matches by swapping with a cow that has a higher rating but is positioned earlier in the sequence. Here’s an example to illustrate this issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to swap the cow at position 5 (cow with rating 12) with the cow at position 3 (cow with rating 727). This way, the cow at position 5 can win the first match against the cow at position 2 (cow with rating 2), and then proceed to win the subsequent matches.

However, the current implementation of the program does not account for this optimal swap. Instead, it only considers up to two cows with higher ratings than the cow at position `k` and returns the maximum number of wins based on these considerations. This leads to an incorrect result for this specific case.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible swaps that could potentially increase the number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
