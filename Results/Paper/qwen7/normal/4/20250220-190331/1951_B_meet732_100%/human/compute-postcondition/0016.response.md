Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `ind` is a list containing 1**

The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be the same variable as `i` (as they are the only variables mentioned and the context suggests they might be the same). Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
