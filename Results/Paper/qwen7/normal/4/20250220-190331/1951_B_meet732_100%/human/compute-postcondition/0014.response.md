Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a[0]` is either greater than `x` or `ind` does not contain 0
   - `c` is 2

3. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1 (making `i` equal to 1) and `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The value of `a[0]`, `ind`, and `c` do not change based on the loop head alone; they are determined by other parts of the program logic and are not directly modified by the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1 (incremented from 0)
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous iteration)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
