Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `c` is 0, `k` is within the range 1 to n, `x` is the integer at index k in list a.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. The values of the other variables (`ind`, `a`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ind` is still an empty list, `a` remains a list of n distinct integers, `c` is now 0, `k` is still within the range 1 to n, and `x` is still the integer at index k in list `a`.
