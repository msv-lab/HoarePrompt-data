Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `k` as the relevant variables.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `i` remains 1.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `c` and `r` are input integers.
   - `num` is 3 if the condition (whether `c` equals `r`) is not met.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, and `k` is greater than 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - If `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `k` must be greater than 2.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be 2 (since it starts at 1 and is incremented to 2).
- `k` must remain greater than 0 and specifically greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2**
