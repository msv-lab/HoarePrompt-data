Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2, so if `num` was initially either 1 or 2 (depending on the condition `c == r`), it will now be 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
