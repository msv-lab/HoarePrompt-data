Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, and since `k` is 0, `t` remains `initial t`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` is 0.
- `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given. Since `k` is 0, `num` is 0.
- `i` is -1 since it increments by 1 in each iteration and starts from -1 when `k` is 0.
- `m` is `n - num` and equals 1.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
