Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - If `c` is equal to `r`, then `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 0, and `num` is set to 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 0 or 1, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1 (if it was 0) or remain 1 (if it was already 1).
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is a loop control variable.
   - The values of `c` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1 after the first iteration if it was 0, or it will remain 1 if it was already 1.
   - `k` remains greater than 0.
   - `c` and `r` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
