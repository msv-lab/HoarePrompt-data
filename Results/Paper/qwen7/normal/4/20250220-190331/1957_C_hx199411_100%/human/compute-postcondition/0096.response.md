Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `m + 1`.
   - `c` is an integer from the input.
   - `r` is an integer from the input.
   - `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `m` is `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0, `dp` is a list of length 1 filled with 1.
   - If `m` is not 0, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, with specific values for `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[i]`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is currently 0, we need to adjust `t` to be non-zero.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is non-zero**
