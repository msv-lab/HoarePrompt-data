You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each of the k moves you made are pairs of integers such that 0 ≤ r_i, c_i < n, and no two rooks (either yours or the computer's) share the same row or column after each of your k moves and their mirrored moves.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an input integer, k is 0, num is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, m is n - num, and either m is 0, in which case dp is a list of length 1 filled with 1, or m is not 0, in which case dp is a list of length m + 1 filled with 0s, with dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, and dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i from 3 to m.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers t, n, and k, and pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) representing moves. It verifies that the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and that no two rooks share the same row or column after each move are met. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
