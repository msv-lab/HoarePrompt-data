Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and \(10^4\) exclusive.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.
   - `num` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. This means the loop will execute `k` times if `k` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `k` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
