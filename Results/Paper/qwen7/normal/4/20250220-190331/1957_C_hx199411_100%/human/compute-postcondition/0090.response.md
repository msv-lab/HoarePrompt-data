Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 4, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is at least 7, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, `i` is 8, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Initially, `i` is 7, so after the first calculation, `i` becomes 8. The value of `dp[8]` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
