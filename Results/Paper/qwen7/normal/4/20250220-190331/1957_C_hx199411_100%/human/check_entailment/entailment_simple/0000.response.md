Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Move Handling**: The program iterates through the `k` moves, checking if the row and column indices are the same (`c == r`). If they are, it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2. This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of free positions left on the board after the initial moves. This calculation is correct.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized correctly. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are set up properly, and the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to calculate the number of configurations for `m` positions. This recurrence relation is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing rooks without attacking each other.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This output is correct based on the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and handles all necessary calculations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
