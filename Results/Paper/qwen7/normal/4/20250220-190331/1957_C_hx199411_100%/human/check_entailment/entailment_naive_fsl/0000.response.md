Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for updating `num` and calculating the number of configurations is flawed. 

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is intended to count the number of unique positions (rows and columns) that have been occupied by rooks. However, the current logic only increments `num` by 1 if the row and column indices are equal (`c == r`), and by 2 otherwise. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each unique row and column combination should be counted once, regardless of whether the rook is placed diagonally or orthogonally.

2. **Incorrect Configuration Counting:**
   - The dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` array is also flawed. The formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly represent the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells. The logic for updating the DP table is based on an incorrect assumption about the number of available positions and their interactions.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 1
  1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - After the first move, the board looks like this:
    ```
    W _ _ _
    B _ _ _
    _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _
    ```
  - The remaining positions are:
    ```
    _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _
    _ _ _ _
    ```
  - There are 9 positions available, and the number of ways to place rooks in these positions without attacking each other is calculated as \(9 \times 8 / 2 = 36\).

However, the provided program calculates the number of configurations incorrectly. For the given input, the program outputs 3 instead of 36.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
