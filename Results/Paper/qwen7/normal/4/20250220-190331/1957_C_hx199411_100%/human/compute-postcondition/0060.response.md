Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `num` is 2.**

The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` was initially 0, after executing this line, `num` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
