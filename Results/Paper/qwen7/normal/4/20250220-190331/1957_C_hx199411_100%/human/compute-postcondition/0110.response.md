Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `num` is `num + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. The other variables (`k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged except for `num`, which is now one more than its previous value.
