Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is a positive integer.
   - `nodes` is an empty list.
   - `c0` is 0.
   - `c1` is 0.
   - `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. 

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body. Since no such specification is given, `n` stays the same.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `ok` will be checked against the new value of `i` (i.e., `visited[i]` should still be False for `ok` to remain True).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `nodes` remains an empty list.
- `c0` remains 0.
- `c1` remains 0.
- `ok` remains True if `visited[i]` is False.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.**
