Output State: **`j` is 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x[i] - x[j]` to `dx`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `dx` becomes `x[i] - x[0]`. The initial value of `j` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `dx` and the unchanged value of `j`.
