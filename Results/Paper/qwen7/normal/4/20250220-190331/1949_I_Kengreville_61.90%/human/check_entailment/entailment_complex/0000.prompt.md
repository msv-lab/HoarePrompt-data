Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

# Annotated Functions:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x is a list of n integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, y is a list of n integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, r is a list of n integers representing the radii of the disks, visited is a list of n boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, coef0 and coef1 are lists of n float values used for calculations, and nodes is a list used for storing nodes during DFS.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n`, each containing `n` integers entered by the user during the loop executions.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, which were input by the user during each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`) remain unchanged from their initial state as described.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)

            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `n`, `nodes` will be an empty list, `c0` will be 0, `c1` will be 0, and `ok` will be `True` if any `visited[i]` is `False` and `c1` is not 0 for those `i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have incremented to `n`, meaning it has checked all indices from `0` to `n-1`. The `nodes` list will be empty because it gets reset at the start of each iteration. Both `c0` and `c1` will be 0 as they get reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `ok` will be `True` if during any iteration, `visited[i]` was `False` and `c1` (which sums up `coef1[j]` values) was not 0 for that particular `i`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n`, `nodes` will be an empty list, `c0` will be 0, `c1` will be 0, and `ok` will be `True` if any `visited[i]` is `False` and `c1` is not 0 for those `i`. Otherwise, `ok` will be `False` if `visited[i]` was not `False` or `c1` was 0 for all `i` during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of disks defined by their x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii. It uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the disks and calculates coefficients for each disk. If any unvisited disk has a non-zero sum of specific coefficients, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of disks, x is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, y is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, r is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, and visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited or not.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: All nodes from 0 to n-1 have been checked against node i. For each node j that satisfies the distance condition \((r[i] + r[j])^2 == (x[i] - x[j])^2 + (y[i] - y[j])^2\) and is not visited, the following conditions hold: `visited[j]` is True, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. The `dfs` function is called for each such node j.
    #State: For all nodes from 0 to n-1, if a node j satisfies the distance condition \((r[i] + r[j])^2 == (x[i] - x[j])^2 + (y[i] - y[j])^2\) and is not visited, then `visited[j]` is set to True, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. The `dfs` function is called for each such node j.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search starting from the disk indexed by `i`. It marks the disk as visited and recursively visits all connected unvisited disks based on their positions and radii. For each connected disk `j`, it sets `visited[j]` to `True`, `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`. After completing the search, all disks that are reachable from the initial disk `i` will have been marked as visited and their `coef0` and `coef1` values updated accordingly.
