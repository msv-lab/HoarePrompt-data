Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `dfs` function and the overall approach do not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency conditions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Tangency Conditions**: The `dfs` function checks for tangency between disks using the equation \((r_i + r_j)^2 = (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2\). However, this alone is not sufficient to ensure that the tangency condition is maintained when the radii are adjusted. The program needs to ensure that the tangency condition holds after adjusting the radii.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Adjusting Radii**: The program attempts to adjust the radii using coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`), but the logic for these adjustments is flawed. The program does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease while maintaining tangency.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where multiple disks are tangent to each other. For example, consider a scenario where three disks are mutually tangent. The program needs to ensure that the radii can be adjusted in such a way that the tangency conditions are maintained and the sum of the radii decreases.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```

This input represents four disks that form a square configuration, where each pair of adjacent disks is tangent to each other. According to the problem description, it should be impossible to decrease the sum of the radii while maintaining tangency. However, the current implementation might incorrectly suggest that it is possible to decrease the radii, leading to an incorrect output of "YES".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
