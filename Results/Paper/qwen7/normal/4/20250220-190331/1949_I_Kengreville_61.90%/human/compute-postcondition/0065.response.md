Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` contains `i`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.**

Explanation: The line `c0 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `c0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `c0` is 0, while `i`, `nodes`, `c1`, `coef0[i]`, `coef1[i]`, `ok`, and the condition related to `visited[i]` remain as they were initially.
