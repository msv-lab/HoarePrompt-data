Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `nodes`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `c0` is `coef0[j] + coef0[j]`
   - `c1` is `coef1[j] + coef1[j]`
   - `j` is the second element in `nodes`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `nodes`. For the loop to continue, `j` must be an element of `nodes`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was the second element in `nodes` during the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be the third element in `nodes`.
   - The values of `c0` and `c1` depend on the value of `j`, but since `j` changes, these values will change as well.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `c0` will now be `coef0[j+1] + coef0[j+1]` because `j` moves to the next element in `nodes`.
   - `c1` will now be `coef1[j+1] + coef1[j+1]` for the same reason.
   - `j` will now be the third element in `nodes`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`c0` is `coef0[j+1] + coef0[j+1]`, `c1` is `coef1[j+1] + coef1[j+1]`, `j` is the third element in `nodes`**
