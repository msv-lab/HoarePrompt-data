Postcondition: **For all nodes from 0 to n-1, if a node j satisfies the distance condition \((r[i] + r[j])^2 == (x[i] - x[j])^2 + (y[i] - y[j])^2\) and is not visited, then `visited[j]` is set to True, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. The `dfs` function is called for each such node j.**
