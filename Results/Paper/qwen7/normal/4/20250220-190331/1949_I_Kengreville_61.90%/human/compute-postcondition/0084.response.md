Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be `n`
- `nodes` will be an empty list
- `c0` will be 0
- `c1` will be 0
- `ok` will be `True` if any `visited[i]` is `False` and `c1` is not 0 for those `i`. The condition `(ok)` is true.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
