### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes various lists and arrays to store information about the disks and their states.
   - It reads the input for the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over each disk.
   - For each unvisited disk, it initializes `coef0` and `coef1` and starts a DFS from that disk.
   - The DFS function is called to explore all connected disks (those that are tangent to the current disk).
   - After the DFS completes, it calculates the sum of `coef1` for all visited disks. If this sum is non-zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

3. **Output**:
   - If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Function `dfs`:
1. **DFS Initialization**:
   - Marks the current disk as visited.
   - Adds the current disk to the `nodes` list.
   - Iterates over all other disks to check for tangency.
   - If a disk is unvisited and tangential to the current disk, it updates the coefficients and recursively calls `dfs` on that disk.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Tangency Condition**:
   - The program correctly checks for tangency using the equation \((r_i + r_j)^2 = (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2\).
   - However, the program does not ensure that the tangency condition is maintained when the radii are adjusted. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to update the radii, but the logic for these updates is flawed.

2. **Radii Adjustment**:
   - The program attempts to adjust the radii using the coefficients, but it does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease while maintaining tangency.
   - The logic for updating the coefficients is based on the assumption that the tangency condition will be maintained, but this is not always true.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where multiple disks are mutually tangent. For example, in a scenario where three disks are mutually tangent, the program might incorrectly suggest that it is possible to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency.

#### Example Input Analysis:
Consider the input provided in the original assessment:
```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```
This input represents four disks that form a square configuration, where each pair of adjacent disks is tangent to each other. According to the problem description, it should be impossible to decrease the sum of the radii while maintaining tangency. However, the current implementation might incorrectly suggest that it is possible to decrease the radii, leading to an incorrect output of "YES".

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `dfs` function and the overall approach do not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
