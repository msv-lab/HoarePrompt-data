Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `j` is `j + 2`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y[i] - y[j + 1]` to `dy`. The value of `dx` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state, and the value of `j` is updated to `j + 1` before the assignment, making it `j + 2`.
