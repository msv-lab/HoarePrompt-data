Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n`, each containing `n` integers entered by the user during the loop executions; `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is in the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` must be a positive integer. If `visited[i]` is False, then `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if `ok` was True or `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if `visited[i]` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is a positive integer, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and `ok` is `True` if `visited[i]` is `False` and either `c1` is not 0 or `visited[i]` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
