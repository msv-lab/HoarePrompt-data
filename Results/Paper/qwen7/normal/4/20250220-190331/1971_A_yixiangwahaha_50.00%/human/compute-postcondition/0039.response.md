Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` and 10 pairs of integers `(x, y)` from the standard input. It then prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. For each pair, if the first integer (`x`) is less than the second integer (`y`), it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. After processing all pairs, the function does not return anything but modifies the lists `x` and `y` in place.**
