Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing two elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1, `xylist` is updated to a list of strings obtained from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes an input from the user, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to `xylist`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
