You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and 10 pairs of integers `(x, y)` from the standard input. It then prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. For each pair, if the first integer (`x`) is less than the second integer (`y`), it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. After processing all pairs, the function does not return anything but modifies the lists `x` and `y` in place.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains a single integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) lines, each containing two space-separated integers \( x \) and \( y \). However, the program assumes that there will always be exactly 10 test cases and reads 10 pairs of integers directly from the input, regardless of the value of \( t \).

For example, if \( t = 5 \), the input would be:
```
5
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
```
The program would still read 10 pairs of integers, which would cause incorrect results. Specifically, it would process the last 5 pairs of integers (which are not part of the actual test cases) and produce incorrect outputs for those pairs.

To fix this, the program should read the value of \( t \) and then process exactly \( t \) pairs of integers. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, ' ', y)
        else:
            print(y, ' ', x)

func()
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each pair of integers accordingly.
