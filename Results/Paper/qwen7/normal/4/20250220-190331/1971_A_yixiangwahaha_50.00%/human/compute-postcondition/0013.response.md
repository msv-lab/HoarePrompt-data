Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `xylist` is a list containing the split input values, `x` is a list containing four elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0])], `y` is a list containing two elements `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` appends the value of `xylist[0]` (which is already an integer) to the list `x`. Since `x` originally contained three elements, after appending, it now contains four elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0])]`. The values of `t`, `xylist`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
