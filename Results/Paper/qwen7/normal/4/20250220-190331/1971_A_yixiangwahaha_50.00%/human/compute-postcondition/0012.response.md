Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `xylist` is a list containing the split input values, `x` is a list containing three elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0])], `y` is a list containing two elements `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes user input and splits it into a list based on spaces. This changes the value of `xylist`, while the other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
