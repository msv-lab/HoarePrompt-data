Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list containing 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list containing 9 elements: `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

3. **Determine Values**:
   - Since `i` is 0, we need to look at the first elements of both lists `x` and `y`.
   - From the definition of `x`, the first element is `xylist[0]`.
   - From the definition of `y`, the first element is `int(xylist[1])`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - We know that `x[i]` (which is `xylist[0]`) is greater than or equal to `y[i]` (which is `int(xylist[1])`).

5. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement will output the first element of `y` followed by a space, then the first element of `x`.
   - Therefore, it will print `int(xylist[1])` followed by a space, then `xylist[0]`.

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **int(xylist[1]) int(xylist[0])**
