Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list containing 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list containing 9 elements: `[int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

3. **Determine Values**:
   - Since `i` is 2, we need to find the values of `y[2]` and `x[2]`.
   - From the definition of `y`, it contains 9 elements all of which are `int(xylist[1])`.
     - Therefore, `y[2] = int(xylist[1])`.
   - From the definition of `x`, it contains 10 elements where the pattern alternates between `xylist[0]` and `int(xylist[1])`.
     - Therefore, `x[2] = int(xylist[0])`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output `y[2]` followed by a space, then `x[2]`.
   - Substituting the determined values, the output will be `int(xylist[1]) int(xylist[0])`.

Output: **int(xylist[1]) int(xylist[0])**
