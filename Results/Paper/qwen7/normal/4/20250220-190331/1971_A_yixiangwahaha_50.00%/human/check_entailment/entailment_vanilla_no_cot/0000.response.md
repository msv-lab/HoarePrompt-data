Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line will contain an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and then each subsequent line will contain two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the provided code reads `t` as a single integer and then proceeds to read 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`.

To fix this, the program should be modified to read the number of test cases `t` first, and then loop `t` times to read and process each pair of integers. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version will correctly handle the number of test cases as specified in the problem statement.
