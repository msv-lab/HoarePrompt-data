Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `xylist` is a list containing the split input values, `x` is a list containing four elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0])]`, `y` is a list containing three elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` appends the value of `int(xylist[1])` to the list `y`. Since `y` was initially `[int(xylist[1])]`, after appending, `y` becomes `[int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`. The values of `t`, `xylist`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
