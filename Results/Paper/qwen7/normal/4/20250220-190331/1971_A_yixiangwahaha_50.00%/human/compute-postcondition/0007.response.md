Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `xylist`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 10.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list containing two elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by space.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `xylist` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `xylist` within the loop.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` remains a list containing two elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` remains a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `xylist` remains the same list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by space.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing two elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by space.**
