Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `c` is an integer obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them by whitespace, converting each to an integer and assigning them to `b` and `c` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
