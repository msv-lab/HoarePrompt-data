Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is `e.index(d[j], k) + 1 + k` where `j` is 0, and `k` equals `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `k` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
