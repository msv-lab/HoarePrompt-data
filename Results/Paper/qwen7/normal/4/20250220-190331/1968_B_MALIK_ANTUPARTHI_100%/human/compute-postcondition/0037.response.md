Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `a` is an integer obtained from input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < a`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an integer obtained from input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `c` is an integer obtained from input.
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is a string obtained from input.
   - `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `e` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes its value, but since the loop body is omitted, `k` stays as it was after the last iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, and `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`.**
