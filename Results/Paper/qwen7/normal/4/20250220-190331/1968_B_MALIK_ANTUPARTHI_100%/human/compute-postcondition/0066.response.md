Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < b`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `d` is a list.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `k` is recalculated based on the previous value of `j` and `e`.
   - The loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `b`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be updated to `j + 1`.
   - `k` will be recalculated using the new value of `j` and the current values of `e` and `d`.
   - The condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` must still hold true.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `j` will be incremented by 1.
- `k` will be recalculated using the new value of `j` and the current values of `e` and `d`.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop remains the same.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
**`d` is a list, `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes `j + 1`), `k` is recalculated as `k = (j + 1) + 1 + e[(j + 1) + 1:].index(d[j + 1 + 1]) + 1 + (j + 1) + 1`, and the loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.**
