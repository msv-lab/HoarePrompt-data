Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is `j`.**

The code `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
