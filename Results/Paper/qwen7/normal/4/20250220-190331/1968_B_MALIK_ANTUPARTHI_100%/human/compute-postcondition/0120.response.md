Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two binary strings \(a\) and \(b\) of specified lengths \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it finds the smallest index \(k\) in string \(b\) where a substring of \(b\) of length equal to the length of \(a\) can be found. If no such substring exists, it returns the length of \(b\). The function prints the value of \(k\) for each test case and does not return any value explicitly.**
