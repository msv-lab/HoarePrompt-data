Postcondition: **`b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[1]) + 1 + k`, and `j` is either 2 or `b - 1`, depending on whether the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is met, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
