Output State: **`k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to the value of `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. Here, `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the element `d[j]` starting from index `k` in the list `e`, and then adds 1 to it, and finally adds `k` to this result. Since the initial values of `e`, `d`, and `j` are not specified, we express the new value of `k` in terms of these variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
