Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other conditions and constraints remain valid as well.
