Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `a` remains the same; `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0. This does not affect the values of `b`, `c`, `i`, `a`, `d`, or `e`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
