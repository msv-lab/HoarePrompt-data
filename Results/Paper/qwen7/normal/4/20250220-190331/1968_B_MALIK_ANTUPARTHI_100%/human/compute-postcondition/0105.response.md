Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is either `e[k:].index(d[1]) + 1 + k` or 1, depending on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not, and `j` is either 2 or `b - 1` or 1, depending on the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` or not.
