Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, and `k` is either `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` (when `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]` and `j` becomes 3), or 2 (when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]` and `j` remains 2), and `j` is 3, breaking out of the most recent loop or conditional structure.**
