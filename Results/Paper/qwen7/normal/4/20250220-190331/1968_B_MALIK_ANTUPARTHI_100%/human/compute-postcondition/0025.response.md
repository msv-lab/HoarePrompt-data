Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is either `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` or `j`, depending on whether `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]` or not, and `j` is 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
