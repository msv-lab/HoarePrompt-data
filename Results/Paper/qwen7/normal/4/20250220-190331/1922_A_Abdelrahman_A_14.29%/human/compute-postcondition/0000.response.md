Output State: **`tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.**

The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but now `tests` holds the value of the input integer within the specified range.
