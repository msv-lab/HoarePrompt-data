Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the string `c`. Therefore, the only object involved in the loop head is `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: The loop initializes `x` to be the last character in the string `c`. This means that before the loop starts, `x` should be set to the last character of `c`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: Since the loop is iterating over each character in `c`, as long as `c` is not an empty string, the loop can execute. However, since the problem specifies that `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1, these conditions do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute based on `x`. The key condition here is that `c` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the states**: Based on the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, which should be the last character in `c`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`x` is the last character in `c`**.
