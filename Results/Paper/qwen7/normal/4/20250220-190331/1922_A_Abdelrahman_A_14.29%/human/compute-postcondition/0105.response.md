Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input value, `c` is a non-empty string, and if `c` contains a character that is not in `a` or `b`, the loop breaks, leaving `no`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` unchanged.
