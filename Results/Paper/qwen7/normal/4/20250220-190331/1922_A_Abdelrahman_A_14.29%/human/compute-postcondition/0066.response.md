Output State: **All characters in `c` have been checked, `no` is False, and none of the characters in `c` were found in both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, it means that every character in the string `c` has been processed. The variable `no` is set to `False` because the loop broke out due to finding a character that is not in `a` and `b`. Since the loop continues to check each character until it finds one that meets the condition (not in `a` and not in `b`), and it breaks out once such a character is found, it implies that no character in `c` was found to meet this condition throughout the entire loop execution. Therefore, `no` remains `False`.
