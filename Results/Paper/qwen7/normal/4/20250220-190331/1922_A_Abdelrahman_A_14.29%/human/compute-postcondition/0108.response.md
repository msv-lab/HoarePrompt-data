Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it returns information based on these inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters and returns different information based on the given integers and strings.
