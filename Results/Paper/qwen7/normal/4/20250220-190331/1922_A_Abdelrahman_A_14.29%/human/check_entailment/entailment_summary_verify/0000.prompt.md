You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of length \(n\), where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\). It then checks if \(c\) contains any character that is not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches \(a\) or \(b\), or if \(c\) contains only characters from \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO". However, this check is insufficient because `c` can still match the template without being exactly equal to `a` or `b`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
3
acc
abd
abc
```

- For the first test case, the program will incorrectly print "NO" because `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`. However, a valid template could be "AB", where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
- For the second test case, the program will correctly print "NO" because `c` matches `a` and `b`.
- For the third test case, the program will correctly print "NO" because `c` matches `a` and `b`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there exists a template that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` but not for `c`. This requires more complex logic to compare each character in `a`, `b`, and `c` according to the template rules.
