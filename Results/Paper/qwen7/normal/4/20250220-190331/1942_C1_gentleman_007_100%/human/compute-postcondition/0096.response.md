Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters and a list `b` of integers representing the indices of characters in string `a`. It returns a reversed string `s` formed by joining the elements of a list `l` based on the optimal path traced through a `dp` table.**
