Functionality: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. `n` represents the number of rows in the nested list, `m` represents the number of columns, and `v` is a list of `m` distinct integers. After execution, the function returns a nested list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the nested list is a sublist containing the integers from the list `v`.
