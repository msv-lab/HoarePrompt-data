Output State: **`q` is a list with the same number of elements as before, `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed, `graph[ver]` must have at least one element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, and `q` now contains an additional element which is `node`.**

Explanation: The code appends `node` to the list `q`. Since `q` originally had one less element than before, after appending `node`, `q` now has the same number of elements as before. The values of `ver` and `graph[ver]` remain unchanged, and `node` is still the next element in `graph[ver]`.
