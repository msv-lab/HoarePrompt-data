Output State: **`graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node, and the current value of `node` is visited; `q` now contains the node that was just appended, and `vis[node]` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the variable `vis[node]` is explicitly set to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
