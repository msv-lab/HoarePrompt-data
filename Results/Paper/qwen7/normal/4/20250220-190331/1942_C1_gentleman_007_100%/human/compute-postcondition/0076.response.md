Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is a non-zero value decreased by 1; `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `x` is the length of `a`; `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`; `y` remains 0; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was originally a non-zero value, it is now one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
