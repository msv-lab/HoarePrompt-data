Output State: **`graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node; `q` contains the node that was just appended.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. The precondition that `graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node remains unchanged. After executing the code, the list `q` now includes the newly appended node.
