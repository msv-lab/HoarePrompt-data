The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers from 1 to n and values are non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of each key `i` from 1 to n in the dictionary `d`, where each term in the sum is computed as `pow(i, d[i] - 1) * (i - 1)`. The function then returns this calculated sum.
