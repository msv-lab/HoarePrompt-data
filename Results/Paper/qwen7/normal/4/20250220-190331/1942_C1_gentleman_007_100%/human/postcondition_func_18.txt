The function accepts a list `p` of integers sorted in ascending order and an integer `x`. It searches for the position where `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `p`. If `x` is found in `p`, it returns the length of the list `p`. If `x` is not found, it returns the index `mid` where `x` should be inserted.
