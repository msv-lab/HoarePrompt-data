The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

After the function executes, `i` will be `n+1` and `j` will be `m+1`, representing the dimensions of the input matrix `l`.

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary containing prime factors of `num` as keys and their respective identifiers as values. After processing, it returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of `num` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that prime factor in the prime factorization of `num`.

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of sides of a polygon. It returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`, specifically {2: 3, 3: 3}, indicating that `n` is fully factored into its prime components. If `n` is a perfect power of a prime, the corresponding entry in the dictionary will reflect that.

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers from 1 to n and values are non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of each key `i` from 1 to n in the dictionary `d`, where each term in the sum is computed as `pow(i, d[i] - 1) * (i - 1)`. The function then returns this calculated sum.

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr` of length `n + 1` starting from `[1, 0]`. If `mod` is `-1`, the list `dearr` will contain the values `[1, 0, 2, 4, 9, 22, 51]` and the variable `i` will be set to 6. Otherwise, each element in `dearr` is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod`, and `i` will be set to `n + 1`.

 Output hints for function25:  The function accepts a vertex `ver` and a graph represented as a dictionary. It marks the given vertex as visited and traverses the graph to mark all vertices reachable from the given vertex as visited. After the function completes, all vertices reachable from the initial vertex `ver` will have their corresponding `vis[node]` set to 1, indicating they have been visited. The `deque` `q` is emptied, and the variable `ver` holds the value of the last visited vertex. The structure of the graph `graph` remains unchanged.
