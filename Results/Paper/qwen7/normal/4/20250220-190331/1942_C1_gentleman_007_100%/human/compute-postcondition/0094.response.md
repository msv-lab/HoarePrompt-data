Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the characters from `a` based on the optimal path traced through the `dp` table, starting from `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` and moving diagonally up-left until reaching `dp[0][0]`; `s` is the string formed by joining the elements of `l` into a single string.**

Explanation: The code `s = ''.join(l)` joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string `s`. The values of `i`, `j`, `a`, `x`, `b`, `y`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `l` contains the characters from `a` that form the optimal path through the `dp` table, and `s` is the resulting string after joining these characters.
