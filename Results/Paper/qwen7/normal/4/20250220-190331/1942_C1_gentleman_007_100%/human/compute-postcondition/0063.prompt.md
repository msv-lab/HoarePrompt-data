Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` now contains all elements except the first one (since `ver = q.popleft()` removed the first element), `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, and all elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node. If the `node` is unvisited, then `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `q` now contains the node that was just appended. If the `node` is already visited, no changes are made to `vis[node]` or `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node. After executing the if statement, if the node is unvisited (`vis[node]` is false), then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and the node is appended to the queue `q`. If the node is already visited, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `graph[ver]` must have at least one unvisited node. If `node` is unvisited (`vis[node]` is 0), then `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `q` contains the node that was just appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
