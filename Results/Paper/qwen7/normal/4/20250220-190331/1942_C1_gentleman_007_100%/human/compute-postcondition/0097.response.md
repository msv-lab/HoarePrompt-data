Functionality: **The function `func_22` accepts a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters and a list `b` of integers representing the indices of characters in string `a`. It computes the longest common subsequence between the entire string `a` and the sequence `b` using dynamic programming. After tracing the optimal path through the `dp` table, it forms a list `l` containing the characters from `a` based on this path, reverses this list, and returns the resulting reversed string `s`.**
