Postcondition: **`q` is a list with one less element than before, `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed, `graph[ver]` must have at least one element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is not visited, then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and `q` now contains an additional element which is `node`.**
