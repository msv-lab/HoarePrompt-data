Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads `2n` integers and sorts them. Sorting ensures that when we take every second element starting from the first, we are essentially pairing the smallest available elements together.
3. **Sum Calculation**: By summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., `A[0] + A[2] + ...`), the program effectively pairs the smallest elements together, which maximizes the score since \(\min(x, y)\) is always taken from these pairs.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated sum for each test case, which is the maximum possible score according to the problem statement.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
