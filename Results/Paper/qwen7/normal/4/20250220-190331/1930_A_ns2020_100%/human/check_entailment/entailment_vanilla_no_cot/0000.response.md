Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
3. **Calculating Score**: By sorting the list, the smallest elements are at the beginning. The program sums up every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which effectively pairs the smallest available numbers together in each iteration.
4. **Output**: The sum is printed for each test case, which corresponds to the maximum score achievable by always pairing the smallest available numbers.

This approach ensures that the score is maximized because it always adds the minimum of the two chosen numbers, and sorting guarantees that the smallest numbers are paired first. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
