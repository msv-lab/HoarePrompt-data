Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `A`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be non-zero is still valid. The value of `n` remains as an input integer, and `A` now holds the list of integers obtained from the input string.
