Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is non-zero. This does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `n` is an input integer. This also does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(sum(A[::2]))`

Given that `A` is a sorted list of integers, the expression `A[::2]` will take every second element starting from the first element of the list. The `sum` function then adds up these selected elements.

To determine the exact output, we need to know the specific elements of `A`. Since the exact elements are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **the sum of every second element starting from the first element of the sorted list A**
