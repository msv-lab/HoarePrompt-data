The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`. It sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `a_1 + a_3 + ...`). The function prints this sum for each test case and continues until all test cases are processed. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` becomes 0, and the final state includes the last processed `n` and the corresponding sorted list `A`.
