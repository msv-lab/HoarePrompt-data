Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `A` is modified to be sorted.
