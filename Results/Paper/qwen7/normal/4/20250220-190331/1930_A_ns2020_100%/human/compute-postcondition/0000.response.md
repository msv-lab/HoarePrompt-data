Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `t` is now the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
