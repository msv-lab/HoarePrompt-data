Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a` repeated according to its position in the list.
- The first element of `a` is not a single character string.
- The last element of `a` is the same as the first element of `a`.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
