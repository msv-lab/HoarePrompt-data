Reasoning:
1. The provided solution checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') but does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all squares the same color across the entire grid.
2. The logic in the solution only considers the first and last rows, which is insufficient. It fails to account for the possibility of making all squares the same color through operations that involve internal rows and columns.
3. The solution incorrectly prints 'NO' if the first row and the last row are different, even though it might still be possible to make the entire grid uniform through other operations.
4. The solution does not handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform through a series of operations involving subrectangles.

Given the problem statement, the solution provided is incomplete and incorrect because it does not cover all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform.

Correctness: **False**
