Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a`. Initially, `first_row` was updated by adding the first element of the first sublist in `a`. Now, `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist instead. The other variables remain unchanged.
