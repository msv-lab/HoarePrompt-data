Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the only element in the list `a` and the first element of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last sublist in `a` to its current value. Since `a` is a list with two elements and each element is a list itself, the first element of the last sublist (`a[-1][0]`) is added to `first_row`. The other variables remain unchanged.
