Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution checks only the first row and the last row, and whether they are the same, but this is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. The solution fails to consider other rows and columns and the operations that can be performed on subrectangles defined by any two squares of the same color.

A correct solution would need to check if there exists a consistent color throughout the entire grid that can be achieved through the allowed operations. The current implementation does not fully address this requirement.
