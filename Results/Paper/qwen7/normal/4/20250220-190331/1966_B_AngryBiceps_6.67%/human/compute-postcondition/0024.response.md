Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each input string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each input string in the list `a`.
- The first element of `a` is not composed of a single character, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
