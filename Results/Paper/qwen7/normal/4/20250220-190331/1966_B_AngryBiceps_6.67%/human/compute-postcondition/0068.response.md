Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the value entered by the user (using `input()`) to the list `a`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` is still `n + 1`. The list `a` now contains one element, which is the input provided by the user.
