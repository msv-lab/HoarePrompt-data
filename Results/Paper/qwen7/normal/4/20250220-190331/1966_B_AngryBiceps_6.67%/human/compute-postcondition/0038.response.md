Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user, `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the only element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` updates the variable `first_row` by adding the first element of the only element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list with one element (which is an input from the user), `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `[0]` accesses its first element. The other variables remain unchanged.
