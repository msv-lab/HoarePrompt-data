Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `cost` is not yet determined.**

Explanation: The code `N = M[:q]` assigns a slice of the list `M` (which is the same as `L`) to the variable `N`. The slice includes the first `q` elements of `L`, where `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`. The values of `m`, `n`, `k`, and `cost` remain unchanged.
