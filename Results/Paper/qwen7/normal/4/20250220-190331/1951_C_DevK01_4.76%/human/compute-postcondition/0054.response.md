Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`, `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is the length of the list `N` after popping.**

Explanation: The given code updates the `cost` variable by adding a complex expression involving the sum of the list `N`, the length of `N` (`n`), the minimum value `m`, and the difference between `k` and `(n - 1) * m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `cost` is updated accordingly, and `n` is also updated to reflect the new length of `N` after any potential popping operation.
