Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list `M` from these integers. The original list `L` remains unchanged, as the code only affects the creation of the new list `M`.
