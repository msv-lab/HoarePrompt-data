The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged.**
