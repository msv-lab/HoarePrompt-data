The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables directly. The values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is calculated as described.**
