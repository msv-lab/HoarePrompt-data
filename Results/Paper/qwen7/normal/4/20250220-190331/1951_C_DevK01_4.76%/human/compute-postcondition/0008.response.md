Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation: The code `N = M[:q]` creates a new list `N` which contains the first `q` elements of the list `M`. The values of other variables (`L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
