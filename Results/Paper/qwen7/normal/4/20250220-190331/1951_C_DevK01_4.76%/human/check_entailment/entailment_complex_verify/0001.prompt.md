You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Example

Input

    4
    
    4 2 3
    
    8 6 4 2
    
    4 2 8

    10000 1 100 10 1000

    5 5 5 5 5 5

Output

    10
    64
    1
    72
    
Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: Output State: All the necessary lists and variables will retain their final values after the loop completes its execution. Specifically, `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is provided initially. For each iteration `_` in the range of `t`, the following will hold true:
    #
    #- `L` will be a list of integers entered by the user for that specific iteration.
    #- `M` will be a sorted version of `L`.
    #- `n` will be the length of the list `N`.
    #- `m` will be the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`.
    #- `k` will be the third element of `L`.
    #- `q` will be the ceiling value of `k / m`.
    #- `N` will be a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
    #- `cost` will be the calculated cost based on the conditions specified in the code, either as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` or `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.
    #
    #After all iterations, the final values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` will reflect the results of the last iteration of the loop. The `continue` statement ensures that the loop proceeds to the next iteration without altering the current values of the variables. Thus, the output state will show the culmination of all individual iteration calculations, with `cost` being the sum of costs from all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving the sorted list \( M \) derived from \( a \), and prints the cumulative cost after processing all test cases. The function does not return any value but modifies internal variables to store intermediate and final results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Setting Parameters**:
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that the maximum number of tickets purchased per day does not exceed `m`.

3. **Sorting Prices**:
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order. This is important because buying tickets at lower prices first can minimize the total cost.

4. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the number of days we need to buy tickets.
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
   - The length of `N` is stored in `n`.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy exactly `k` tickets without needing to increase the price.
     - The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, we need to account for the increased prices after the initial days.
     - `w` is the last element of `N` (the price on the last day before increasing).
     - `mu` is the remaining number of tickets to be bought after the initial days.
     - The cost is calculated as `mu * w` plus the cost of the initial days.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `4 2 3`
   - Ticket prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Sorted prices: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - `q = 2` (since `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`)
   - `N = [2, 4]`
   - Cost: `2 * (2 + 4) + 2 * 2 * (1) = 4 + 8 + 4 = 16`
   - Correct output should be `10`, so this part is incorrect.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4 2 8`
   - Ticket prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Sorted prices: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - `q = 4` (since `ceil(8 / 2) = 4`)
   - `N = [2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - Cost: `2 * (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) + 2 * 2 * (3 * 2 // 2) = 30 + 12 = 42`
   - Correct output should be `64`, so this part is incorrect.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5 100 1`
   - Ticket prices: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
   - Sorted prices: `[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]`
   - `q = 1` (since `ceil(1 / 100) = 1`)
   - `N = [1]`
   - Cost: `1 * 1 = 1`
   - Correct output is `1`, so this part is correct.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `6 3 9`
   - Ticket prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - Sorted prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - `q = 3` (since `ceil(9 / 3) = 3`)
   - `N = [5, 5, 5]`
   - Cost: `3 * (5 + 5 + 5) + 3 * 3 * (2 * 1 // 2) = 45 + 9 = 54`
   - Correct output should be `72`, so this part is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
