Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`, `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`, `n` is the length of the list `N` after popping.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = len(N)` simply assigns the length of the list `N` to the variable `n`.
- Since `N` was previously defined as a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `n` was updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `n` now holds the length of the list `N` after the pop operation.
- All other variables (`M`, `k`, `m`, `N`, `q`, `w`, `mu`, `cost`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
