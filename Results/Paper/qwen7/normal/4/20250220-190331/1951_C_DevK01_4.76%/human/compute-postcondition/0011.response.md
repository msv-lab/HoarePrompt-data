Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is an integer representing the length of list `N`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the cost using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, and `n` is the length of `N`. The value of `cost` is calculated based on these values, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cost`.
