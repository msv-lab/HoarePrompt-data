Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`, `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. The length of `N` is updated to the new length after the pop operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
