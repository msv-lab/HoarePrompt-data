Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L` minus the last element, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `N`. Since `N` originally contained the first `q` elements of `L`, after popping the last element, `N` now contains the first `q-1` elements of `L`. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is calculated based on `k` and `m`, and `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `N` before the pop operation.
