Output State: **`mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, `m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L` minus the last element, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

In this output state, the variable `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`, while all other variables retain their initial values and relationships as described in the initial state.
