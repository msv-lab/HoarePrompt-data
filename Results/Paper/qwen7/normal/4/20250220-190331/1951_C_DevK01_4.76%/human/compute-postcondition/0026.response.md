Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not yet determined, `N` is not yet determined, and `cost` is not yet determined; `L` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `L` in place. Since `m`, `n`, and `k` were initially the first, second, and third elements of `L` respectively, after sorting, `m` will be the smallest, `n` the second smallest, and `k` the largest among these three. All other variables (`q`, `N`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.
