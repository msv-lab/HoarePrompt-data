Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `q` has been calculated as the ceiling of the division of `k` by `m`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
