The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers. It checks if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and if `extroverts % 3 + universals` is less than 3. If this condition is met, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3.
