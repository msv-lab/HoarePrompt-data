Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals, `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.

Explanation: The code `ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)` calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `extroverts` and `universals`. The return value of this function call is stored in the variable `ret`. The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged from their initial state.
