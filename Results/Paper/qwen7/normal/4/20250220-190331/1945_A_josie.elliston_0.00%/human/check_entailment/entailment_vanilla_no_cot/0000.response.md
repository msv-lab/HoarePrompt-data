Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not fully account for the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` needs to be more robust to ensure that all participants' preferences are respected and to correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Tents for introverts
    tents_for_introverts = introverts
    
    # Remaining universals after assigning tents to introverts
    remaining_universals = universals - introverts
    
    # Tents for extroverts
    # Each extrovert needs a tent with 2 others
    # We need to see how many full groups of 3 we can form
    full_groups_of_3 = extroverts // 3
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    
    # Tents for extroverts and universals
    # We use remaining_universals to fill the remaining spots
    # If remaining_extroverts is 1 or 2, we need an additional tent
    tents_for_extroverts = full_groups_of_3 + max(0, (remaining_extroverts + 1) // 2)
    
    # Total tents needed
    total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_extroverts
    
    # Check if we have enough universals to fill the remaining spots
    if remaining_universals < remaining_extroverts:
        return -1
    
    return total_tents

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_tents(a, b, c))
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed while ensuring all participants' preferences are respected.
