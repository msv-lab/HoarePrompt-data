Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and an introvert. Specifically, consider the following input:

- `introverts = 1`, `extroverts = 4`, `universals = 1`

According to the problem description, the extroverts should pair up with universals and an introvert. However, with 4 extroverts and only 1 introvert and 1 universal, it's impossible to satisfy all preferences. The program does not account for this scenario and incorrectly returns 3 tents instead of -1.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are enough universals and an introvert to pair with all extroverts before calculating the number of tents.
