Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times, `tmp` is 'c'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the end of the string `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `tmp` is set to `'c'` (since `k` is 3, and `tmp` is assigned `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`). Therefore, `ans` will be updated to be the string 'c' repeated `cnt` times. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
