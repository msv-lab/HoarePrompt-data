Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`.**

Explanation: The code increments `cur` by shifting `1` left by `cur_ss` positions and then adding the result to `cur`. Since `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was initially `0`, it means that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was `0`. After executing `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` will now be `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
