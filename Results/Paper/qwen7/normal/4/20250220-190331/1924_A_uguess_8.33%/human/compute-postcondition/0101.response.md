Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is 'z'**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt`. Given that `k` is not defined in the initial state and no default value is provided, we assume `k` is 1 (since `ord('a')` is 97, `chr(97 - 1)` gives 'z'). Thus, `ans` becomes `'z' * 3`, which results in `'zzz'`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `k`, the most accurate representation is to leave `k` as a variable unless specified otherwise. But based on typical assumptions and the given format, we assume `k` is 1, making `ans` equal to `'z' * 3`. The values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged, and `tmp` remains an empty string.
