Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `cur` is 1 << (`ord(ss) - ord('a')`), `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it. Here, `1 << cur_ss` is a left shift operation which shifts the number 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions. Given that `cur_ss` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, the value of `cur` becomes `1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`. The values of `cnt` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.
