State: **`cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`.
2. The variables involved in the loop head are `ss` (which takes each character from `s`), and implicitly, `s` itself.
3. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. If `s` were empty, the loop would not execute at all.
4. The initial values of `cnt` and `cur` are given as 0, but these do not affect the loop's execution condition directly. They might be modified within the loop body, but their initial values do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop runs.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `s` must be a non-empty string.
