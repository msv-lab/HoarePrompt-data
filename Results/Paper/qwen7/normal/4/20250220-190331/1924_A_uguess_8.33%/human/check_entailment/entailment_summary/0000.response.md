Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
3. It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the presence of characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in the string `s`.
4. The program iterates through each character in `s`, updating the bitmask `cur` if the current character is encountered.
5. When the bitmask `cur` matches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in sequence, and it increments the count `cnt`.
6. After processing the entire string `s`, it checks if `cnt` is at least `n`. If so, it prints 'YES'.
7. If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans`:
   - `ans` consists of `cnt` characters, each being the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet.
   - It appends 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
8. The construction of `ans` ensures that it is a valid string of length `n` that cannot be found as a subsequence in `s`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
