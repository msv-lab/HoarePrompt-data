Postcondition: `tmp` is 'a', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, `i` is 1, and the current value of `cur` satisfies `cur & 1 << i == 0`.

This postcondition summarizes that after executing the if-else block, `tmp` is set to 'a', `cnt` remains unchanged as the count of valid substrings, `cur` is reset to 0, `ans` is a string of `cnt` characters each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to 1 while `cur & 1 << i == 0` holds true.
