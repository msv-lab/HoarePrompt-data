Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'z', `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp`. Since `i` is 3, `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97), and adding 3 to it results in 100, which corresponds to the character 'd'. Therefore, `tmp` is updated to 'd'. All other variables remain unchanged.
