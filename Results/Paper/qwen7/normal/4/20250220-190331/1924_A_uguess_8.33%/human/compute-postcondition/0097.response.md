Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `cnt` is 3 and `cur` is 0. Additionally, it is mentioned that `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. However, the value of `n` is not explicitly provided. The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the variables `cnt`, `cur`, or `n`. Therefore, the output is exactly as written in the print statement.
