You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(m\), along with a string \(s\) consisting of the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, it checks if there are at least \(n\) valid substrings of length \(k\) in \(s\) where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in a bitmask \(cur\). If the count of such substrings is at least \(n\), it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string \(ans\) consisting of \(cnt\) characters, each being the character at position \(k-1\) in the alphabet, followed by 'a' repeated \(n - cnt - 1\) times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Bitmasking Logic**:
   - The program uses bitmasking to track the presence of each character in the string `s`.
   - `cur` is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a particular character (from 'a' to 'a+k-1') has been seen.
   - `cur & 1 << cur_ss` checks if the character `ss` has already been seen.
   - `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the corresponding bit to indicate the character has been seen.
   - `if cur == (1 << k) - 1:` checks if all `k` characters have been seen at least once.

3. **Counting Valid Subsequences**:
   - `cnt` keeps track of how many times all `k` characters have been seen together.
   - When `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in sequence, so `cnt` is incremented.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES" because all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

5. **Constructing the Non-Subsequence String**:
   - The program constructs `ans` by finding the first missing character in the bitmask `cur` and appending it to the result.
   - It ensures the length of `ans` is `n` by padding with 'a' if necessary.

### Correctness Check:

- The program correctly handles the bitmasking logic to track the presence of characters.
- The counting mechanism for valid subsequences is accurate.
- The construction of the non-subsequence string is logically sound and follows the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
