Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 0, `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. Since `i` is 0, `tmp` becomes `chr(ord('a') + 0)`, which is `'a'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
