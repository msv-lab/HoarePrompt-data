Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` to the variable `cur_ss`. Since `ss` is not defined in the initial state, `cur_ss` will hold the difference between the Unicode code point of `ss` and the Unicode code point of `'a'`. The values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged.
