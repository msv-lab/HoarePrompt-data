Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `s` is an empty string.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each time, the loop will execute `k` times.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 and will increment up to `k-1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `k` remains as it is because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, the state after adjustment should include:
- `s` is an empty string.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
- `i` is 0.

Final State:
**`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 0**
