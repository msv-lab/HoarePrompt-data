Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'zdaa', `k` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of the other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `k`) remain unchanged. Since the input values for `n`, `k`, and `m` are not specified, they are described as input integers.
