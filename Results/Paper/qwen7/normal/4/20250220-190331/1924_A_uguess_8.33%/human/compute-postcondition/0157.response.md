Postcondition: **`cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` is reset to 0, and `cnt` holds the final count. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`) retain their initial or final states as given.**
