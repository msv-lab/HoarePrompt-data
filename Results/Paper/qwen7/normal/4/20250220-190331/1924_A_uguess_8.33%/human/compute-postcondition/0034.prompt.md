Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and shifted left by `cur_ss` bits.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string with at least one character, `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << (cur_ss + 1)) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. If the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` becomes 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
