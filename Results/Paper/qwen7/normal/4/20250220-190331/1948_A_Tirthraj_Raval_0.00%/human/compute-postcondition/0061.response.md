Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` is an integer, and `pattern` contains 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'B'.** 

This postcondition covers both cases of the if and else parts. If `n % 2 == 1` is true, the pattern will be constructed as described, and if `n % 2 == 1` is false, the pattern will already be in the specified state due to the loop running `n // 2` times.
