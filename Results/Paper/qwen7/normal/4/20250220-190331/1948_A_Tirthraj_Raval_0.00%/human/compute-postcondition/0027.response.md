Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` is an input integer, and `pattern` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `pattern` as an empty list, which does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, `t` remains greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` remains an input integer, and `pattern` becomes an empty list.
