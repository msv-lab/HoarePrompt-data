Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list containing one more element than before, where the last two elements are 'A' and 'B', `i` is `i_current + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is `i_current + 1`, `i % 2` will evaluate to either 0 or 1. If `i % 2` is 0, it appends 'A'; if `i % 2` is 1, it appends 'B'. Since the last element in the pattern list is 'B', the next element (which is now the second last) must be 'A'. All other variables remain unchanged.
