Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pattern` is a list containing 'A' and 'AB'.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n // 2`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n // 2` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must be such that `n // 2` is at least 3, meaning `n` must be at least 6.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 6**
