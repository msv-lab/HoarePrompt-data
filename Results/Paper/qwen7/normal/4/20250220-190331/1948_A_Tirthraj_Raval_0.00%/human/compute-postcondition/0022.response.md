Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is an odd number, then no change occurs to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is adjusted to be at least 2, and `pattern` is a list containing exactly `n // 2` elements, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' if `n // 2` is odd and with 'B' if `n // 2` is even.
