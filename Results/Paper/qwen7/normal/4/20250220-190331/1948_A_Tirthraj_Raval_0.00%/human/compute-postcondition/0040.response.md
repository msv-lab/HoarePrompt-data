Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` is an integer, and `pattern` remains unchanged. If `n` is odd, `t` is decremented by 1 and `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 6, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is set to 6, `i` is equal to 3, and `pattern` is a list containing 6 elements where every even index element is 'A' and every odd index element is 'B'.**
