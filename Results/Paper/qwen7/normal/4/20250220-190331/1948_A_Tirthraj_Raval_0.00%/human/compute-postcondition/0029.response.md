Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `pattern` is a list containing 'A'**

Explanation: The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the list `pattern` based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `i % 2` is 0, which means 'A' is appended to `pattern`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
