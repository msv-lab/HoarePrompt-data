Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` is an input integer, and pattern is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `pattern = []` initializes an empty list named `pattern`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, and `n` is an input integer.
