Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'**.

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is 3, `i % 2` evaluates to 1 (since 3 % 2 equals 1), so `'AB'[1]` is `'B'`. Therefore, `'B'` is appended to the list `pattern`, which previously contained `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
