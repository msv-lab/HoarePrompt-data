Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**
