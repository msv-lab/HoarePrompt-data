Output State: **`space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd.**

Explanation: The code updates `remaining_cells` to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. Since `screen_require_for_y` depends on the value of `y`, we keep the expression for `screen_require_for_y` as it is. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
