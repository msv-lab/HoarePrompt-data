Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` if `screen_require_for_y` is in `result`, otherwise `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`; `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

This output state reflects that the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the integers provided by the user's input, while all other variables retain their original conditions and values.
