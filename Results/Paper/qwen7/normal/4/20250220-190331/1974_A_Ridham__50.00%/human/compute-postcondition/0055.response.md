Output State: **`remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 if y % 2 == 0 else y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, and `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`.**

Explanation: The code appends `screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. Since `screen_require_for_y` is defined based on the value of `y`, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`remaining_cells`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`) are also unchanged. The only new information is that `result` now contains `screen_require_for_y`.
