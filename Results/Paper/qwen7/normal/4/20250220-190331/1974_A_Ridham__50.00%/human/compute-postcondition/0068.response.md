Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on specific conditions involving \(x\) and \(y\). If \(y\) is even, the number of screens required is \(y // 2\); if \(y\) is odd, it is \(y // 2 + 1\). It then checks if the available space (\(space_x\)) is sufficient; if not, it calculates the additional screens needed. The function compiles these results into a list and prints each result on a new line.**
