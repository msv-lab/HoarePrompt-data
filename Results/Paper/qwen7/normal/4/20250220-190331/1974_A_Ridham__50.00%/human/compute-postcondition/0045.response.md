Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `result` is a list containing either two elements: `screen_require_for_y` and the original element, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `space_x` is equal to `x`
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`
- `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains two elements. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on the remaining cells and `space_x`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `_` is used, but it does not hold any specific value.
   - The loop counter `n` is decremented by 1 each time the loop iterates.

2. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop counter `n` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to decrement `n` by 1.
   - All other variables (`space_y`, `t`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `total_space`, `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_screen`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since `n` was greater than 1 initially and we just decremented it by 1).

### Final Answer:
State: **`space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list containing either two elements: `screen_require_for_y` and the original element, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd, If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains two elements. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on the remaining cells and `space_x`.**

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
