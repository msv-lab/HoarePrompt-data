Output State: **`total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.**

The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` calculates the integer division of `y` by 2 and assigns the result to `screen_require_for_y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
