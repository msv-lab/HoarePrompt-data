Output State: **`extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`, and `space_x` is not divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` which is defined as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. Since `extra_space` is derived from `space_x - remaining_cells`, the calculation of `extra_screen` does not change the values of `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `remaining_cells`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `n`, `result`, or their relationships. Therefore, these variables and their conditions remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `extra_screen`, which is calculated based on the existing `extra_space`.
