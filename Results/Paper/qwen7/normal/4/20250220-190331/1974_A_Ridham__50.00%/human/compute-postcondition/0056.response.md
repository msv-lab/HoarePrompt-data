Output State: **`remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 if y % 2 == 0 else y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `space_x - remaining_cells` to the variable `extra_space`. Since `space_x` is equal to `x` and `remaining_cells` is defined as `15 * (y // 2 if y % 2 == 0 else y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`, the value of `extra_space` is calculated based on these expressions. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
