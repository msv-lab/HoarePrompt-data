State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used, which means it is an anonymous index variable. The value of `_` itself doesn't matter; what matters is the condition under which the loop will execute.
- The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- The initial state of `t` (an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) and the fact that `result` is an empty list do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.
