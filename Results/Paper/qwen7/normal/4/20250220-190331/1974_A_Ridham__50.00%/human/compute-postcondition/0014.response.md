Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `remaining_cells` based on the value of `screen_require_for_y`, which is `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `y // 2` if `y` is even.
- The formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` is used to determine `remaining_cells`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
