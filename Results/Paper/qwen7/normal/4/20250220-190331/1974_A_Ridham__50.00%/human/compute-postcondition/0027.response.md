Output State: **`extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` or `extra_space // 15 + 1`, `screen_require_for_y` is added to `extra_screen`, `result` is a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.**

This means that the `extra_screen` value remains unchanged, or is recalculated based on the divisibility of `space_x` by 15. The `screen_require_for_y` is added to `extra_screen` and the result is stored in the list `result`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
