Output State: `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (`x`, `y`), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1).

This means after the loop has executed all 4 iterations (since the `range(4)` generates indices from 0 to 3), the variable `res` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `i` will be 3, indicating the last iteration of the loop. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the third split of input integers. The list `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of integers entered as input, with the last three tuples being (1, 1) based on the given pattern.
