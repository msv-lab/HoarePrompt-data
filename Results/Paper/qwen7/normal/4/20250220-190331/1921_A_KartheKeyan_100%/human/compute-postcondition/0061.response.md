Output State: **`res` is sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (sorted(x, y)), `p1` is 0, `p2` is ((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)².**

The code `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. Since the initial value of `n` was not explicitly given, we assume it was derived from the splits `x` and `y`. However, the code only modifies `n` without affecting any other variables. Thus, the values of `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `coord`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `n` is now one less than its original value, which is represented as `i` being 2 instead of 3.
