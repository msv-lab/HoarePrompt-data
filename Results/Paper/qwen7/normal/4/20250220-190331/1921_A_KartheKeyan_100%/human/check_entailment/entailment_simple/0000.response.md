Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases (`n`).
2. For each test case:
   - It reads four pairs of coordinates.
   - It sorts the coordinates to ensure they are in a consistent order.
   - It calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners (which should be equal since it's a square).
   - It computes the side length of the square by taking the square root of the distance.
   - It prints the area of the square by squaring the side length.

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

- Reading the number of test cases and entering the loop to process each test case.
- Collecting the coordinates and sorting them.
- Calculating the squared distance between two adjacent corners.
- Computing the side length and then the area.
- Printing the area and decrementing `n`.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the approach taken in the code is correct. The sorting ensures that the coordinates are processed in a consistent manner, and the distance calculations correctly identify the side length of the square.

The annotated explanation provided matches the actual implementation and logic of the program accurately.
