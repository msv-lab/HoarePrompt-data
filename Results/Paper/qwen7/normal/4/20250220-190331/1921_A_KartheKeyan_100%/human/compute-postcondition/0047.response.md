Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` now contains one tuple with these values. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.
