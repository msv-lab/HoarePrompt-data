Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, `p2` is the square of the difference between the first elements of the third and second tuples plus the square of the difference between the second elements of the third and second tuples.**

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of the third and second tuples in the `coord` list. Since the list is sorted in ascending order based on their first element, the differences are calculated using the coordinates of these two tuples. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` remain unchanged from the initial state.
