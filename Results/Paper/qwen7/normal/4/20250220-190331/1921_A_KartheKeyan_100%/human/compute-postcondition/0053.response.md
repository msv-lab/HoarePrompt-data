Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the first split, `y` is an input integer from the second split, `coord` is a list containing three tuples: (`x`, `y`), (1, 1), and (1, 1)**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples: (`x`, `y`) and (1, 1). After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains three tuples: (`x`, `y`), (1, 1), and (1, 1). The values of `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
