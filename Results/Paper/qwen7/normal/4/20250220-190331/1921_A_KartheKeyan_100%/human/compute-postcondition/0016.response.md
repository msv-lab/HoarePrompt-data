Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, which are the last four pairs of integers entered.**

Explanation: The `coord` list is sorted using the `sorted()` function, which sorts the list of tuples in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. Since the loop has already executed all 4 iterations, the values of `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers entered during the third and fourth iterations. The `i` variable remains 4 as the loop runs from 0 to 3, inclusive.
