Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The initial values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.
