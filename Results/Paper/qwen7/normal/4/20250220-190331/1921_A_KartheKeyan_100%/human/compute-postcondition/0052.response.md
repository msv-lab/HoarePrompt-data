Output State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the first split, `y` is an input integer from the second split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (`x`, `y`) and (1, 1)**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged. The list `coord` remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
