Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing three tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))**.

The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `coord` initially contains two tuples `((x, y), (x, y))`, after appending `(x, y)`, it now contains three tuples: `((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
