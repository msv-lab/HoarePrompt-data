Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `k` is `-n+1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `bm` is the sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` added `n-1` times, `sm` is the sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` added `n-1` times, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + ... + a[s])` (where `a[s]` is added `n` times), `bp` is `a[b] + (a[b] + ... + a[b])` (where `a[b]` is added `n` times), and either `(bm < sm)` or `(bm >= sm)` holds true.**
