Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `k` is `-n+1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations. If `bm > sm`, the function sets `bm` to the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations. Otherwise, `bm` remains as the sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` added `n-1` times. Similarly, if `bm > sm`, the function sets `sm` to the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. Otherwise, `sm` remains as the sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` added `n-1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged, meaning `a`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bm`, and `sm` retain their final values from the third iteration. Specifically, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `0`, `b` and `s` are updated according to the loop's logic, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` from the last two iterations, `bm` is the highest value of `a[b] * k + bp` calculated in the last two iterations, and `sm` is the highest value of `a[s] * k + sp` calculated in the last two iterations. Additionally, if `bm > sm`, the function continues with the if part's logic; otherwise, it follows the else part's logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bm` is `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `k` is `-n`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`. If `bm > sm`, then `bm` is updated to `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. Otherwise, `bm` remains as `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and all other variables retain their values as described in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
