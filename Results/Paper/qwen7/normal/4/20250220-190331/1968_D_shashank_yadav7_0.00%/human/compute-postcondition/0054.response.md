Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `k` is `-n+1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations. If `bm > sm`, the function sets `bm` to the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations. Otherwise, `bm` remains as the sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` added `n-1` times. Similarly, if `bm > sm`, the function sets `sm` to the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. Otherwise, `sm` remains as the sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` added `n-1` times.**
