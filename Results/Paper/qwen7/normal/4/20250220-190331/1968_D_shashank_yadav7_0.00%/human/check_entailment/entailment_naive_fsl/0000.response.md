Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible cases. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the scores and positions in a way that does not reflect the rules of the game. For instance, the program does not properly handle the scenario where a player chooses to stay at their current position instead of moving to \(p_x\). Additionally, the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible score for each player after each turn, which is necessary to determine the winner.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

However, the provided program might produce incorrect results due to its flawed logic. A correct implementation would need to explore all possible moves for each player and calculate the maximum score for each player after each turn, considering both staying at the current position and moving to \(p_x\).
