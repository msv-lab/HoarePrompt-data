Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1` - 1, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `-1` to `-2`. The values of `i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the operation `k -= 1`.
