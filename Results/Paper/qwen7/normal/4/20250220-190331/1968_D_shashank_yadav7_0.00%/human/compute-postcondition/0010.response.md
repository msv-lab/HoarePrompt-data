Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `k` is unchanged, `b` is `b-1`, `s` is a single integer obtained from the input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `sp` is the element at index `s` of list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` of list `a`, `bm` is the product of `a[b]` and `k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to `sm`. Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and `s` is a single integer obtained from the input decreased by 1, `a[s]` is an integer from the list `a`. Multiplying this integer by `k` (which is unchanged) gives the value of `sm`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
