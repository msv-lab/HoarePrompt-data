Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n + 1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n + 1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns it to the variable `p`. This changes the value of `p` but does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `n`, or `k`. The values of `b` and `s` remain as defined in the initial state because they depend on the value of `p`, which now contains the new input list.
