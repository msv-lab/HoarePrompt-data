Output State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals specified in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state, and we simply indicate that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
