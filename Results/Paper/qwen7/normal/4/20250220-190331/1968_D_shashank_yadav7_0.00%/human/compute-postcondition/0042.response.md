Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Since `bp` was previously `a[b] + a[b]`, after the addition, `bp` becomes `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, and `sp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
