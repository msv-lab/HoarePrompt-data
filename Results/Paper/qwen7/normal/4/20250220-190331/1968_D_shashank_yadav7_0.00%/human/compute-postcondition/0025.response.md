Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all the variables remain unchanged as no assignment or other operations are performed.
