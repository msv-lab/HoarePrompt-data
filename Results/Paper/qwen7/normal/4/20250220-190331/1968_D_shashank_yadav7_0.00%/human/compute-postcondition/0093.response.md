Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
