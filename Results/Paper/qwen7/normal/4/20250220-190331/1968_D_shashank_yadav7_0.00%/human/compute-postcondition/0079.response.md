Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1`
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `k` is equal to 0
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
   - `sp` is `sp + a[s]`
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b]`

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - Since `k` is equal to 0, it remains unchanged.
   - `s` and `sp` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.
   - `bp` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `bm` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `b` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `sm` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state of `i` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer**
