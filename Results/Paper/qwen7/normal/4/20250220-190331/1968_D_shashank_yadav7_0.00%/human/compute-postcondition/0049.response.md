Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `k` is `-n + 1`.
   - `b` is `p[p[...]] - n + 1` where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`. This means `b` is the result of applying the function `p` repeatedly `n-1` times starting from `b` and then subtracting `n - 1`.
   - `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`. Similar to `b`, this means `s` is the result of applying the function `p` repeatedly `n-1` times starting from `s` and then subtracting `n - 1`.
   - `bm` is the sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` added `n-1` times.
   - `sm` is the sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` added `n-1` times.
   - `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + ... + a[s])` where `a[s]` is added `n` times.
   - `bp` is `a[b] + (a[b] + ... + a[b])` where `a[b]` is added `n` times.
   - `(bm < sm)` holds true.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Sasha')
   ```

Given the print statement, it simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **Sasha**
