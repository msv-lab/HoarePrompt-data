Output State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, `sm` is increased by `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]**.

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. Since `k` was initially `-1`, after executing this line, `k` becomes `-2`. The other variables (`bm`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them in this line of code.
