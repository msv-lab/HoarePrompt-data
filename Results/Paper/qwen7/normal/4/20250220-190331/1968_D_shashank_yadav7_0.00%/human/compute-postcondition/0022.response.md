Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
