Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but since `k` was not initially defined, it is assumed to be equal to `i`, which is `n - 2`. After decrementing, `k` becomes `n - 3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is only used to initialize `i`.
