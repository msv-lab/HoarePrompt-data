Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n + 1`, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `bp` is now the value of `a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code `bp = a[b]` assigns the value of the element at index `b` in the list `a` to the variable `bp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
