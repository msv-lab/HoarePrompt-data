Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is decreased by 1.**

The code `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. The conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` must still be less than `n`, and `n` must still be a non-negative integer. The only change is that `k` has been decreased by 1.
