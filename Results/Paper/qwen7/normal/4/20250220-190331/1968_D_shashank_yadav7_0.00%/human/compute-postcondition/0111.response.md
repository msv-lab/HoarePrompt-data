Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `0`, `b` and `s` are updated according to the loop's logic, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` from the last two iterations, `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` from the last two iterations, and `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` from the last two iterations, and `bm` is compared to `sm` as follows: if `bm` is less than `sm`, no changes are made; if `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, no changes are made either.
