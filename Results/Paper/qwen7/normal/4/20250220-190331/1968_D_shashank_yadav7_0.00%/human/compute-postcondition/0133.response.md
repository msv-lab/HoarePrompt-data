Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, and `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `bm` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. Since `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[b] * 0 + bp`, which further simplifies to `bp`. The values of `b`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
