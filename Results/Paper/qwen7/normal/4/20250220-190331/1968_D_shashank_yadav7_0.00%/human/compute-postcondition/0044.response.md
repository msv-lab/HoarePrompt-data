Output State: `i` is `n`, `k` is `-n+1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n+1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `bm` is the sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` added `n-1` times, `sm` is the sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` added `n-1` times, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + ... + a[s])` (where `a[s]` is added `n` times), `bp` is `a[b] + (a[b] + ... + a[b])` (where `a[b]` is added `n` times).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `i` will be equal to `n`, the total number of iterations.
- `k` will be `-n+1`, since it starts at `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration.
- `b` and `s` will be deeply nested applications of the `p` function, adjusted by the number of iterations, reflecting the changes made in each iteration.
- `bm` will be the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations.
- `sm` will be the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations.
- `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations.
- `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations.
