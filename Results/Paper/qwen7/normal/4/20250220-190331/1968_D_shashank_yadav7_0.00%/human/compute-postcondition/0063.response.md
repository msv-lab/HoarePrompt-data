Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n + 1`, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bm` is updated to `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `bp` is now the value of `a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `bm` to the value of `a[b] * k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
