Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `p`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
