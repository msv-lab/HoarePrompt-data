Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here, `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, and then 1 is added to the result. Since `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, it means `k` can take any value from 1 up to 2 times `n`.

However, without the specific value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `k // 2 + 1`. But we know that the expression `k // 2 + 1` will always yield an integer value because `k` is an integer.

Therefore, the output will be an integer value that depends on the value of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer input and is less than or equal to 2 times n)**
