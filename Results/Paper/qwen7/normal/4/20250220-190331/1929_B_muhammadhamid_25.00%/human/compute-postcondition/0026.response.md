Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. Instead, it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the program continues the loop.
