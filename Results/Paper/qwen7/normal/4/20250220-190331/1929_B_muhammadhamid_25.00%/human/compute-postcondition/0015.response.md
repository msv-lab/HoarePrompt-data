Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the first input and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts. These two parts are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The first integer is assigned to `n`, and the second integer is assigned to `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
