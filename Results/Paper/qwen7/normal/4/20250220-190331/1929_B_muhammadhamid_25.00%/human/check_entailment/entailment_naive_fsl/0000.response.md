Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where `k` is greater than `2 * n` but less than `4 * n - 2`. Let's consider the following example:

For a test case with `n = 3` and `k = 7`, the program should output `4` because we need to color cells such that 7 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3` because it uses the condition `print(k // 2 + 1)` which is not always correct.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `k > 2 * n` more carefully. A correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of cells needed based on the value of `k` relative to `2 * n` and `4 * n - 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k <= 4 * n - 2:
            print(min(2 * n, k))
        else:
            print(2 * n)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly by considering the different ranges for `k` and calculating the minimum number of cells needed accordingly.
