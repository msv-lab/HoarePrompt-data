Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the first input and is less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).

The expression `k // 2 + 1` is evaluated and printed. Here, `//` denotes integer division, so `k // 2` divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number, and then 1 is added to the result.

Since `k` is an integer less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), the value of `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer starting from 1 up to \(n + 1\). However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we cannot specify a precise numerical value for the output.

Thus, the output will be the value of `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer less than or equal to 2 * n)**
