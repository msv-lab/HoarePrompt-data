Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, and `k` is 1. After the execution of the if else block, either the loop or iteration continues as `k` is set to 1, or there is no change in the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` since there is no else part.
