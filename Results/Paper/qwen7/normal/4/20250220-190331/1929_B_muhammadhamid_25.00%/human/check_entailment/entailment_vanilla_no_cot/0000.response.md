Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `k` is greater than `2 * n`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case When `k` is 1**: The solution correctly prints `1`, which is the minimum number of cells needed.
2. **Case When `k` is between 2 and 2*n**: The solution uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to calculate the minimum number of cells needed. This is generally correct because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).

However, the issue arises when `k` is greater than `2 * n`. In such cases, the solution incorrectly prints `k // 2 + 1`. The correct approach would be to recognize that after coloring `2 * n` cells, any additional cells will cover additional diagonals more efficiently. Specifically, each additional cell beyond `2 * n` can cover 2 more diagonals.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
        elif k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # After coloring 2*n cells, we need to color additional cells
            remaining_diagonals = k - 2 * n
            additional_cells_needed = math.ceil(remaining_diagonals / 2)
            print(2 * n + additional_cells_needed)


# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that the minimum number of cells required is calculated accurately for all values of `k`.
