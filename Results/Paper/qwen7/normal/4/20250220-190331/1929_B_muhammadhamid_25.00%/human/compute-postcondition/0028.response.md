Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and after executing the if statement, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and the loop continues.
