Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `k` is 1, and it is stated that `k` being less than or equal to 2 * n is false.

From the condition "k being less than or equal to 2 * n is false," we can deduce that \(k \leq 2 * n\) is not true. Since `k` is explicitly given as 1, this means \(1 > 2 * n\), which implies that \(n < \frac{1}{2}\). However, since `n` is an integer, the only possible value for `n` is 0. But if `n` were 0, then `k \leq 2 * n` would be true because \(1 \leq 0\) is false, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, there must be no valid integer `n` that satisfies both conditions simultaneously under normal integer constraints.

Given the constraints and the fact that `k` is explicitly set to 1, the expression `k // 2 + 1` evaluates to \(1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\).

Output: **1**
