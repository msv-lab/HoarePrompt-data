Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the first input and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and we continue with the next iteration or statement.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
