Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `k` is initialized to 1.
- `k` is also stated to be less than or equal to 2 times `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `k` is explicitly set to 1.
2. The expression inside the `math.ceil` function is `k / 2`, which simplifies to `1 / 2`.
3. `1 / 2` equals `0.5`.
4. Applying the `math.ceil` function to `0.5` results in `1` because `math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1**
