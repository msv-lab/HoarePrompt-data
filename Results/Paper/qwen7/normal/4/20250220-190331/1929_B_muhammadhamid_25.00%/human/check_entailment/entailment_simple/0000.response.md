Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

1. **Case when \( k = 1 \):**
   - The program correctly prints `1`, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color at least one diagonal.

2. **Case when \( k \leq 2n \):**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of cells needed using `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction). Hence, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells.

3. **Case when \( k > 2n \):**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of cells needed using `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because once we have colored \( 2n \) cells, we can cover \( 2n \) diagonals. Any additional \( k - 2n \) diagonals will require at least one more cell per diagonal, hence the formula \( \frac{k - 2n}{2} + 1 \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly handles all cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
