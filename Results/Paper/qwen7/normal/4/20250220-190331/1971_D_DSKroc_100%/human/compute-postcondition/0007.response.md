Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a string with length greater than 1, the current value of `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, `count` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` was 0. After executing `count += 1`, `count` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
