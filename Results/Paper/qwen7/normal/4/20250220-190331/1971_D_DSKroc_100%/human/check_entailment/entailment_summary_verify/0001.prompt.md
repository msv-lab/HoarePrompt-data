You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates the number of positions in the string `s` where a character is followed by a smaller character, adding one to this count if no such pair exists. If there is at least one pair of consecutive characters where the first character is less than the second, a flag is set. After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated count for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of cuts.
   - `flag` is initialized to 0. This flag will indicate whether the string has any increasing sequence of characters.

3. **Loop Through String**:
   - The program loops through the string `s` from index 0 to `len(s) - 2`.
   - For each pair of adjacent characters, it checks if they are different (`int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`).
     - If they are different, it increments `count`.
     - If the current character is less than the next character (`int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`), it sets `flag` to 1.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is 0, it means the string is non-increasing, and we need to add 1 to `count` (since the entire string can be treated as one piece).
   - Otherwise, the number of pieces is simply `count`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Pieces**:
   - The logic for counting the number of pieces is flawed. The program counts the number of transitions (changes in value) but does not correctly account for the requirement to form a sorted binary string.
   - For example, consider the string "1010". The program would count 3 transitions but only needs 2 pieces ("10" and "10").

2. **Handling Non-Increasing Strings**:
   - The program handles non-increasing strings incorrectly. It adds 1 to `count` when `flag` is 0, but this is not always correct. For instance, "010" should be split into 2 pieces ("01" and "0"), not 1.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the positions where the string changes from '0' to '1'. Each such change indicates a potential boundary for a piece. We also need to ensure that the last segment is considered as a piece.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_zero_index = -1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '1':
                if last_zero_index != -1:
                    count += 1
                last_zero_index = i
        # Add one more piece for the remaining segment
        count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of pieces required to form a sorted binary string. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
