Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the entire string might be sorted without needing any cuts. For example, consider the input `000111`. According to the problem description, the entire string can be considered as one piece, and no cuts are needed since it is already sorted. However, the program would incorrectly count the number of cuts needed based on consecutive different characters, which in this case would be `2` (cuts between the first and second `0`, and between the last two `1`s), leading to an incorrect output of `2`.

To fix this, the program should check if the entire string is already sorted and output `1` in that case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        if s == ''.join(sorted(s)):  # Check if the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for i in range(len(s) - 1):
                if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                    count += 1
            print(count + 1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where the entire string is already sorted correctly.
