Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, `count` will be incremented for each pair of consecutive characters where the first character is less than the second character, `flag` remains 0 as no pair of consecutive characters satisfies the condition `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])` during the loop's execution.**
