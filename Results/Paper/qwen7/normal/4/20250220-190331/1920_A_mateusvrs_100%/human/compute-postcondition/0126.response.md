Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `1000000000.0 + 7` to `ax` after converting it to an integer. Since `1000000000.0 + 7` equals `1000000007.0`, and converting it to an integer removes the decimal part, `ax` becomes `1000000007`. All other variables remain unchanged.
