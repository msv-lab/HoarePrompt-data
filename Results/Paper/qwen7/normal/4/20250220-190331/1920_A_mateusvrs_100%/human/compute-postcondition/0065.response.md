Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1), `_` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `tmp` remains unchanged.**

The code `bx = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `bx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
