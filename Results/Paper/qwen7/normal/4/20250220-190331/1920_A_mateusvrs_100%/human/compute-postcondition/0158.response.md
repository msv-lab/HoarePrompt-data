Output State: **`_` is 3, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was either an empty set or a set containing `x`, adding `x` again does not change its content. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
