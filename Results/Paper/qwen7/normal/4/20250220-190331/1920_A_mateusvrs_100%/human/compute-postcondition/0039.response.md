Postcondition: `t` is at least 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), and `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (with the condition that `bx` is greater than `ax`).
