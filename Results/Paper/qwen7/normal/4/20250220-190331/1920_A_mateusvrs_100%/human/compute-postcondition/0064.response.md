Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1), `_` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided), and `tmp` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)` assigns the value `1000000007` to the variable `ax`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
