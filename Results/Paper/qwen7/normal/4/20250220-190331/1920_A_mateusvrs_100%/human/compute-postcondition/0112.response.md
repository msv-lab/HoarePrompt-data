Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is taken from the set `cx`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `cx`, `ax`, or `bx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cx`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `tmp` is updated based on whether `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cx` must contain at least one element.
   - If `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `cx`, the next element `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must still be within the range `[bx, ax]` to increase `tmp` by 1.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `cx` must still contain at least one element (since we are moving to the next element).
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` will be increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise it will remain unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `cx` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` will be increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise it will remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, `i` will be the next element in `cx`, `tmp` will be increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise it will remain unchanged**.
