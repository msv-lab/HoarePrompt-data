Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007 (or 1000000007 if `x` is greater than 1000007), `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on these variables also remain valid.
