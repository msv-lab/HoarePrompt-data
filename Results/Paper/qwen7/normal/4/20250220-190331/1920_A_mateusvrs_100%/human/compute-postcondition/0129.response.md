Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. The values of the other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are dependent on the input provided by the user.
