Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is an integer from the input, and the current value of `a` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx` (-1). Since `x` is an integer from the input and its current value is not specified, `bx` will take the larger value between `x` and `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
