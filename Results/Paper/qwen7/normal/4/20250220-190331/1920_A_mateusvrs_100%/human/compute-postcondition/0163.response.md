Output State: `_` is `n`, `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer provided initially, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the `min` function), `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the `max` function), `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.

In this final state, the variable `_` will have the value `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The set `cx` will contain every unique `x` value that was added to it throughout the loop's iterations. The variable `ax` will hold the smallest `x` value encountered among all inputs processed. Similarly, `bx` will hold the largest `x` value encountered. Both `a` and `x` will retain their last input values from the final iteration of the loop.
