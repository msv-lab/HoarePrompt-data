Output State: **`r` has the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` has been processed, `tmp` is equal to the size of the original `cx`, and `i` is the last value from `cx` that met the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. The values of `cx`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. `tmp` is still equal to the size of the original `cx`, and `i` is still the last value from `cx` that met the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.
