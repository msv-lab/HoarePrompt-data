Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n)`. The only variable here is `_`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`.
   - `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007 (or 1000000007 if `x` is greater than 1000007).
   - `bx` is -1.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `x` is an integer from the input.
   - `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same because it is the upper limit of the loop.
   - All other variables (`t`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007 (or 1000000007 if `x` is greater than 1000007), `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1.**
