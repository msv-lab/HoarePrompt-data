Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x` again (if it wasn't already present), `cx` will now contain `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
