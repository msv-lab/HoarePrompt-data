Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used.
   - `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1.

4. **Analyze the Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next value from the updated `cx`.
   - `cx` will be updated after each iteration, removing the value of `i` that was just used.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `cx` will be updated to remove the current value of `i`.
   - `i` will be the next value from the updated `cx`.
   - `tmp` will be increased by 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `cx` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used and the next value, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1**.
