Output State: **`cx` must contain at least two elements, `i` will be the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged; `tmp` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions for `cx`, `i`, and the range check remain the same as the initial state.
