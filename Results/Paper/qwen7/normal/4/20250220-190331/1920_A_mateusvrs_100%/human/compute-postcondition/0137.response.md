Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `a` is not equal to 1, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `ax` is updated to be the minimum value between `x` and the current value of `ax` (which is 1000007). Since `x` is an input integer and no specific value is given, `ax` will take the smaller value between `x` and 1000007. All other variables remain unchanged.
