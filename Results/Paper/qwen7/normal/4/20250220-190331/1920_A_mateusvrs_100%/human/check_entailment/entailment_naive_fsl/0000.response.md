Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers \( k \). Specifically, the program fails to account for the constraints of type 3 (k must not equal some integer \( x \)) properly.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4
1 1
2 10
3 5
3 1
```
- Expected Output:
```
8
```
- Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case:
- The constraints are \( k \geq 1 \), \( k \leq 10 \), \( k \neq 5 \), and \( k \neq 1 \).
- The valid values for \( k \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
- The program calculates \( ax - bx + 1 - tmp \), where \( ax = 10 \), \( bx = 1 \), and \( tmp = 1 \) (since 1 is in the set \( cx \)).
- However, the program incorrectly returns 0 instead of 8.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the exclusion of specific values (type 3 constraints). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
