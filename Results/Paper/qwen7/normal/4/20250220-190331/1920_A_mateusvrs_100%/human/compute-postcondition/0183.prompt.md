Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is 0, `_` is `n`, `t` is at least 0, `cx` is a set containing all the `x` values that were added during the loop iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 2`), and `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 1`), with the additional condition that `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value, `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. This holds true whether `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, or if it does not meet these conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used and the next value, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, the condition holds as specified. If not, the condition does not change.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
