Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), and `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (or -1 if no valid `x` is provided).**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` initializes the variable `tmp` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
