Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `_`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `_` is 1
   - `t` is at least 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`
   - `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000007
   - `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `x` is an input integer

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 2.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
