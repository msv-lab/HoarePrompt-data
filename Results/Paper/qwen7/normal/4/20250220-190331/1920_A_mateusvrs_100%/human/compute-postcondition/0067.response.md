Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1), `_` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. It does not affect the values of `r`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`. Additionally, `t` is decreased by 1 due to the context provided in the initial state.
