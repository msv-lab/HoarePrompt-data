Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `n-1` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop starts with `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `n - 3`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n - 3`.
   - The value of `suff[i]` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`. Specifically, `suff[i]` will be `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`, where `i + 1` is now `n - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `suff[i]` is `suff[n - 2] + c[n - 3]**.
