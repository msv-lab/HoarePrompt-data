You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `0`; `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the time `i` becomes `0`, `suff[0]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c` because each `c[i]` is added to `suff[i + 1]` as `i` decreases from `n - 1` to `0`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `k`; `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`, as the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `k`. The value of `suff[0]` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in the list `c` and is not modified within the loop. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum value between its current value and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. Since `i` reaches `k`, the term `suff[i + 1]` becomes `suff[k + 1]`, which is effectively out of bounds and thus not considered in the final value of `ans`. Therefore, `ans` retains the minimum value found during the loop's execution.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between its initial value and all the values of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for each iteration where i ranges from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `b` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a value based on the comparison of elements in lists `a` and `b` considering the constraint on `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
