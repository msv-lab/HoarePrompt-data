Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `b` (a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It computes the minimum value of `a[i] + suffix_sum[i+1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, where `suffix_sum` is the cumulative sum of the element-wise minimum of lists `a` and `b` from index `i` to the end of the lists. The function returns this minimum value.**
