Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `0`; `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`, updating the `suff` array such that `suff[i]` accumulates the sum of `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `suff[0]` will hold the total sum of all elements in `c`.
