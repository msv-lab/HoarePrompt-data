State: **`i` must be less than k, suff[0] is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, ans is infinity**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
2. The loop runs from `i` in the range `range(k)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `k-1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `k`.
4. The initial value of `suff[0]` is given as the sum of all elements in the list `c`, and this does not change based on the loop itself.
5. The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity, and its value is not directly affected by the loop initialization but might change inside the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `i` is less than `k`. The other states (`suff[0]` and `ans`) remain as given.
