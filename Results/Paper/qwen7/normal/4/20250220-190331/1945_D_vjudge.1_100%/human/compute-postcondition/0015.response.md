Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `k` and equals the previous value of `i` + 1.
   - `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < k` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `suff[0]` remains unchanged because it is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` may or may not change depending on the value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to consider this change yet.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `suff[0]` remains the same.
- `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`i` is less than `k` and equals the previous value of `i` + 1; `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.**

However, for clarity and to match the format requested:

State: **`i` is less than `k` and equals the previous value of `i` + 1; `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.**
