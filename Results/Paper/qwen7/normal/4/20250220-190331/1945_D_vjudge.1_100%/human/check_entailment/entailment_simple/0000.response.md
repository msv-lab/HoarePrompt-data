Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `n` and `k` correctly, and reads the lists `a` and `b` as required. This part is also correct.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the correct parameters. This part is correct.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **List Comprehension**: The list `c` is correctly computed as the element-wise minimum of `a` and `b`. This step is correct.
   - **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly computed. Each element `suff[i]` represents the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to the end of the list. This step is correct.
   - **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity and is updated in a loop to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions. The logic here is correct. For each position `i` from `0` to `k-1`, the cost `a[i] + suff[i+1]` is calculated and compared with the current value of `ans`. This ensures that `ans` holds the minimum cost after the loop completes. This step is correct.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case, which is correct.

Given that all parts of the program follow the logic correctly described in the problem statement and the provided annotations, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
