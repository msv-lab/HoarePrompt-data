Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), which represent the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.
3. It then reads the values of the cubes \( a_i \).
4. The program identifies the value of the favorite cube by accessing \( a[f-1] \).
5. It sorts the list \( a \) in descending order.
6. It iterates through the first \( k \) elements of the sorted list to count how many times the favorite value appears in these positions.
7. It also counts the total occurrences of the favorite value in the sorted list.
8. Based on the comparison between the count of the favorite value in the first \( k \) elements and the total count of the favorite value, it determines the output:
   - If the count in the first \( k \) elements equals the total count, it means the favorite cube must be removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If the count in the first \( k \) elements is zero, it means the favorite cube is never removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the logic and the provided execution summary, the program accurately follows the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
