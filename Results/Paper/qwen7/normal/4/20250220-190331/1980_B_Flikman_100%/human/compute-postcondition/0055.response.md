Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`, `removed_count` will be the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` will be the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, and all other variables (`a`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`) will retain their values from the initial state. Additionally, `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.**
