Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `k-1`, `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`) retain their values from the initial state.**
