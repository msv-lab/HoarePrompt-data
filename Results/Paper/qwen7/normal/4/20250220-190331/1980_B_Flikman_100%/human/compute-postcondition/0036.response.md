Output State: **`favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times the value at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and mapping the input, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`favorite_count`, `i`, `k`, `removed_count`, `n`, `f`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation.
