Output State: **`i` is `k`, `removed_count` is 0, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count = 0` initializes `removed_count` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
