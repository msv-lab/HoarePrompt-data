Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `removed_count` is 3, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order**.

Explanation: The line `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Since `removed_count` was initially 2, after executing this line, its new value is 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
