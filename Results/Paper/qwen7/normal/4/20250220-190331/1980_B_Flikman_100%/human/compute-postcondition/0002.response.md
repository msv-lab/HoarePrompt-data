Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 1000, while `n`, `f`, and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
