Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Other variables (n, f, k, and the list a_i) are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` remains greater than 0, and `removed_count` is equal to the number of times the value at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, and all other variables (`a`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`) retain their values from the initial state. Additionally, `removed_count` is either equal to `favorite_count` or not equal to `favorite_count` depending on the execution path taken within the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `removed_count` is either 2 or 3, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `favorite_count` remains the same. Otherwise, `favorite_count` is less than the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
