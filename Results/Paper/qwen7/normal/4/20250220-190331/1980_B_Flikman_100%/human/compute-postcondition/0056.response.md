Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`.
- `removed_count` will be the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `favorite_count` will be the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`.
- `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` without any additional variables or values being included.

Output: **YES**
