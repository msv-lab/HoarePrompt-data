Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `k - 1`, `removed_count` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `removed_count += 1` increases the value of `removed_count` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is an integer less than `k - 1`, this condition remains unchanged. The only change is that `removed_count` is incremented by 1.
