Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer less than `k`.
   - `sorted_a[i]` is compared to `favorite_value`.
   - If `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is increased by 1.
   - If `sorted_a[i]` does not equal `favorite_value`, no change occurs to `removed_count`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be incremented from its current value to `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `k`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `i + 1` must still be less than `k` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an integer less than `k - 1`, `sorted_a[i]` is compared to `favorite_value`. If `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is increased by 1. If `sorted_a[i]` does not equal `favorite_value`, no change occurs to `removed_count`.**
