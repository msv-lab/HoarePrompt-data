Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `removed_count` is either 2 or 3.
- `favorite_count` is less than the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order.
- `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`.

The `print('MAYBE')` statement simply prints the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
