Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
