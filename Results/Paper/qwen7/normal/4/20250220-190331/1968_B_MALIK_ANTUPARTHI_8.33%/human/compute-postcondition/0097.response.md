Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is `j + 1`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 2, and the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
