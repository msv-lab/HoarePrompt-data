Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `b`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer.
   - `i` is `b + 2`.
   - `k` is either `j + 1` (if the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`) or 2 (if the character at position `j` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`).
   - `d` is the new value of the input string.
   - `e` is the new input string.
   - `j` is 2.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 2, `b` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will increment by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `b` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration but must be greater than 2.

5. **Final State**:
   - `b` remains the same but must still be at least 1 (and now specifically greater than 2).
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same (since `i` is derived from `b` and `b` does not change).
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `d` remains the same.
   - `e` remains the same.
   - `j` becomes 3.
   - We are not breaking out of the loop, so the loop continues.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`b` must be greater than 2, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, `i` is `b + 2`, `k` is either `j + 1` (if the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`) or 2 (if the character at position `j` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`), `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `j` is 3**.
