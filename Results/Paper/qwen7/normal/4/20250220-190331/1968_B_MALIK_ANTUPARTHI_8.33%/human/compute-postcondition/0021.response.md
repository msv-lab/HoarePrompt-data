Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `j` is the next integer in the range [0, `b-1`], `k` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of `j + 1`. The values of `b` and `j` remain unchanged, and `k` is updated to be `j + 1`. The precondition that `j` is the next integer in the range `[0, b-1]` is still valid, and `k` is now one more than `j`.
