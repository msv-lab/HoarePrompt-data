Based on the initial state described:

- `b` remains unchanged from its last value during the loop execution.
- `i` has been incremented by the number of times the loop was executed, which is `b`.
- `k` is set to `b`.

When the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is `b`.

Output: **b**
