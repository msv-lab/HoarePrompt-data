State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` must be 0, `a` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 in the `range(a)` function.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must be a positive integer because `range(a)` will generate numbers from 0 to `a-1`.
- The initial value of `i` is 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `a` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be initialized to 0.
