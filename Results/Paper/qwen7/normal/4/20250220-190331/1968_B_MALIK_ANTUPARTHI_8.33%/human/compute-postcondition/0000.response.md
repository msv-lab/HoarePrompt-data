Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
