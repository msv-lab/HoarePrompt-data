Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 2, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, and `k` is either `j + 2` (if the character at position `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`) or 3 (if the character at position `j` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`). Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.
