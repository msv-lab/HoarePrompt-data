Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j + 2`. If `k` equals `c` or if `j` reaches `b - 1`, the loop or conditional block is exited. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, the same conditions apply but the loop or conditional block is exited.
