Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is `b + 2`.
   - `d` is the new value of the input string.
   - `e` is the new input string.
   - `k` is updated based on certain conditions involving `j`, `b`, `c`, and `e`.
   - `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer.
   - `j` remains 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `b-1`.

3. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `b`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` remains 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `b` must be greater than 3 (since `j` needs to be less than `b`).

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `i` is `b + 2`, so it does not change.
   - `d` and `e` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer.
   - `j` remains 3.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `b` must be greater than 3.
- `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer.
- `j` remains 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`b` must be greater than 3, `i` is `b + 2`, `d` is the new value of the input string, `e` is the new input string, `c` is updated to the new value of the second input integer, and `j` is 3.**
