Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in list `e` plus one.**

Explanation: The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of `d[j]` in the list `e` and assigns `k` to be that index plus one. The initial conditions for `b` and the relationship between `d[j]` and `e[k:]` remain unchanged.
