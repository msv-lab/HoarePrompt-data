Output: **Yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines that `i` is 0.
- `q` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `x` is a list containing a single element, which is 0.
- `inds` is an empty dictionary.
- `l` and `r` are the results of calling `func_1(int)`. Since the function name and its implementation are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. However, the condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is met because both `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]` are 0.
- The print statement simply outputs the string 'Yes', regardless of the values of other variables.

Therefore, the output is **Yes**.
