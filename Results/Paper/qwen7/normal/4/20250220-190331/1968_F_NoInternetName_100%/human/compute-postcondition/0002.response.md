Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list containing a single element which is 0.**

In this case, the code initializes a list `x` with a single element `0`. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
