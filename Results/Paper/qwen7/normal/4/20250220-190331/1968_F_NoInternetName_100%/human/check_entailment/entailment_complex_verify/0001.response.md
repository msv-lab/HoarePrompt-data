### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, the subarray can always be divided into equal parts with XOR zero.
   - For non-zero XOR values, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR of the left and right parts match the overall XOR value.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function reads and splits input data.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function performs binary search.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is essentially a wrapper for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** This function is another wrapper for `func_2` with an additional offset.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** This function processes the main logic for each test case and query.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Read `n` and `q`.
     - Read the array `a` and compute the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Store indices of each unique XOR value in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query, check if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - If not, use binary search to find potential split points.
     - Check if the split points allow for valid divisions.

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Prefix XOR Array (`x`):**
     - The prefix XOR array `x` is constructed such that `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
     - This helps in quickly computing the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r]` as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

   - **Dictionary `inds`:**
     - The dictionary `inds` stores the indices of each unique XOR value in the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - This allows quick lookups to find the first occurrence of a specific XOR value within a given range.

   - **Query Handling:**
     - For each query, the code checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` is zero.
     - If not, it uses binary search to find potential split points.
     - The binary search is used to find the first index `lower` where the XOR value matches `x[r]` and the last index `upper` where the XOR value is less than or equal to `x[l-1]`.
     - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means a valid split point exists, and the subarray is considered interesting.

6. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The code handles the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is zero correctly.
   - The binary search approach is efficient and correctly identifies potential split points.
   - The logic for checking split points is sound and covers most cases.

7. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code might not handle very large arrays efficiently due to the nested binary searches.
   - However, given the constraints (sum of `n` and `q` do not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\)), the current implementation should be sufficient.

### Conclusion:

After careful analysis, the provided code follows the problem's requirements and logic correctly. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient processing of the queries. While there might be minor edge cases that could be optimized, the core logic is sound and handles the problem effectively.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
