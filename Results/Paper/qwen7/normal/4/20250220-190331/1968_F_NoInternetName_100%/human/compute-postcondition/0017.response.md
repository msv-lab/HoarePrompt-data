Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with an integer argument (the value of `int`), and it returned two values which were assigned to `l` and `r`. The values of `i`, `q`, `x`, and `inds` remained unchanged from their initial states.
