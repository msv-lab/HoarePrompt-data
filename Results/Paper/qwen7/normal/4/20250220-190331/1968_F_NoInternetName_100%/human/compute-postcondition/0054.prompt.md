Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. After all iterations, the list `x` will contain the cumulative XOR results of all elements in `a`, starting from the initial value of `x` which is `[0]`. Specifically, `x` will be transformed as follows: `x[0] = 0`, and for each subsequent index `i`, `x[i]` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to the `i-1`th element. The dictionary `inds` will map each value in `x` (excluding the initial `0`) to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the list `x` will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`, starting from 0, and `inds` will store the indices of each unique value in `x` that results from the XOR operations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`. If `upper` (which is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]) is greater than `lower`, then `upper` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `upper` is set to `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= l)].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `lower` is 0, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `lower` is 0, `upper` is undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
