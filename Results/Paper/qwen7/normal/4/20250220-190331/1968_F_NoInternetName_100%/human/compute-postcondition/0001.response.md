Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `a` is now a list returned by `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The line `a = list(func_1(int))` assigns the list returned by `func_1(int)` to the variable `a`. The values of `n` and `q` remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values still hold. The list `a` is updated to contain the elements returned by `func_1(int)`, and the conditions on the elements of `a` (each element being in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30) still apply. The values of `l` and `r` are not affected by this line of code.
