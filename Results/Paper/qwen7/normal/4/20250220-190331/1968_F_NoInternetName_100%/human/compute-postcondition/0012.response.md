Output State: **`a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code appends `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Since `x[-1]` is the last element of `x` before the append operation, and `i` is the next element from `a`, the new value of `x` is the previous `x` with the additional element `x[-1] ^ i`. The condition that `a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, and `i` is the next element from `a` remains unchanged. Also, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` because the length of `x` has increased by one due to the append operation.
