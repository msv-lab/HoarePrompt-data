Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`, and neither `n` is equal to 20 nor `k` is equal to 10000000000. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 5999999999, `k` is not equal to 4294967295, and either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`. Furthermore, `k` is not equal to 3000000000.
