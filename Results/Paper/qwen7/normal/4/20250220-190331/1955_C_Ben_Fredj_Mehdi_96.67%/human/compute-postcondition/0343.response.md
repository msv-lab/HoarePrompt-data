Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 4, `g` is 3, `a[g]` is now a specific integer that is one less than its original value, `a[d]` is now a specific integer that is one less than its original value. If `a[d]` equals 0, then `a[d]` remains unchanged.
