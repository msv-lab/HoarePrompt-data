Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input. If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
