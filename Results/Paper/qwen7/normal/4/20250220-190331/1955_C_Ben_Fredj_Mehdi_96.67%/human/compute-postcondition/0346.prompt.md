Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last element (a[d]) is decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and if `a[g]` is 0, the value of `a[g]` remains unchanged. If an IndexError occurs, the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 2, `a[g]` is a specific integer that was one less than its original value, `a[d]` is also a specific integer that was one less than its original value, and the function breaks out of the loop or conditional block if an exception occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 4, `g` is 3, `a[g]` is now a specific integer that is one less than its original value, `a[d]` is now a specific integer that is one less than its original value. If `a[d]` equals 0, then `a[d]` remains unchanged. The state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
