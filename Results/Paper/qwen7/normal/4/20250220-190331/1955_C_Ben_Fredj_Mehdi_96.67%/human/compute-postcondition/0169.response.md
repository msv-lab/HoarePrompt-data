Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, and `k` is the second element of `a`. If `k` equals 199999999999999, then `k` is set to 199999999999999. Otherwise, `k` remains as follows: 
- If `k` is equal to 1000000000000, then `k` remains 1000000000000.
- If `k` is an even number, each element in `a` (except possibly at indices `g` and `d`) is decremented by 1. If an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. The loop breaks if an exception occurs during any iteration. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged.
