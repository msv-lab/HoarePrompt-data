Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last `k // 2` elements are decreased by 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus `k // 2`, `g` is `k // 2`, and `a[g]` is decreased by 1 if `k` is odd.**
