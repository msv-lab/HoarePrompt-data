Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `z` and the range function which takes `t` as its argument.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `z`**: Since `z` is being used in the loop, it should start from 0 (the default starting point for the `range` function) and increment until it reaches `t`.

3. **Determine the Value of `t`**: The variable `t` is defined as the integer input from the user, and it is given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and that `z` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches `t`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `z`.

- `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` must start from 0 and increment until it reaches `t`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0**.
