Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is adjusted based on the number of iterations, `k` is divided by 2 and floored, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is adjusted based on the number of iterations where `a[g]` became 0, and `a[d]` is adjusted based on the number of iterations where `a[d]` became 0.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `d` will be reduced by 1 for each time `a[d]` becomes 0, and `g` will be increased by 1 for each time `a[g]` becomes 0. The variable `k` will be divided by 2 and floored after all iterations. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and any other variables not directly modified by the loop will remain as they were after the last iteration provided in the problem statement.
