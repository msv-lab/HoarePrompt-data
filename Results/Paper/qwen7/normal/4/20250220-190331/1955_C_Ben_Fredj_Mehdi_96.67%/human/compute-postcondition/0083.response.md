Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `k` is currently equal to 5999999999.
- Either `n` is not equal to 20 or `k` is not equal to 10000000000.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('5')
```

This statement will print the string `'5'` directly, regardless of the values of other variables like `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **5**
