Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 2, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is 3, `a[d]` is -1, `a[g]` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. Given that `g` was initially 2, after executing this line, `g` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
