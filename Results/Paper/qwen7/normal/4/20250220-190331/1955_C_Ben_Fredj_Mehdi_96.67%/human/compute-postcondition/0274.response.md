Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input. If `k` equals 199999999999999, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `k` equals 1000000000000, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `k` equals 200000000000, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `n` equals 2 and `k` equals 2147483648, then `k` is set to 1000000000 and `a` becomes `[1000000000, 1000000000]`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition.
