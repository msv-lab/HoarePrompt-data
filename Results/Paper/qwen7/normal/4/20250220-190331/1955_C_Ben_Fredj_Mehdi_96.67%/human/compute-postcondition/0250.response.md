Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus `k`, `k` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0, and all elements in `a` from index `g` to `d` are 0.

This output state is calculated based on the fact that the loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0. Each iteration of the loop decreases `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1, and adjusts `g` and `d` accordingly. The loop will continue until `k` becomes 0, meaning no more pairs of indices can be found that satisfy the conditions within the loop. At this point, `g` will be set to the highest index where `a[g]` is still greater than 0, and `d` will be adjusted to reflect the new length of the list segment that contains non-zero values.
