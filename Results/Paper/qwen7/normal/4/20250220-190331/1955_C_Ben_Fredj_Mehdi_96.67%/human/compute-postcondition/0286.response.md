Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is the input string, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input string `a`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])` extracts the substring from the beginning of the string `a` up to the first space, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `n`. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.
