Output State: **`n` is now (`n` - (`n` + 1) // 2), `m` is (`n` + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: Initially, `m` is calculated as (`n` + 1) // 2. After executing `n -= m`, `n` is updated to its original value minus `m`. Since `m` is (`n` + 1) // 2, `n` becomes (`n` - (`n` + 1) // 2). The value of `m` remains unchanged as the subtraction operation only affects `n`.
