Output State: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

After all iterations of the loop, `n` will eventually become 0 because the loop reduces `n` by `m` where `m = (n + 1) // 2`. This process continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0. At that point, the loop terminates, leaving `n` as 0. The other variables (`t`, `k`, and `L`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
