Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `n` is decreased by \((n + 1) // 2\), and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is decremented by \((n + 1) // 2\). All other variables (`L`, `pow`, `k`, `m`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
