Output State: **`L` is an empty list but now has at least 1 element, `tot` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and the current value of `tot` is less than `k` which is less than or equal to `tot` plus a, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, causing us to exit the innermost loop or conditional block we were in. However, none of the variable values have changed as a result of the `break` statement itself. The conditions involving `tot` and `k` remain unchanged.
