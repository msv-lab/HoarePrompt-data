Output State: `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `k` is `k - 3 * tot`, `pow` is `pow * 8`, `tot` is incremented by the last element added to `L`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `L` will contain at least 3 elements. The variable `pow` will be equal to `2^3` or `8`. The variable `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the loop condition was no longer met. The variable `k` will be reduced by three times the final value of `tot`.
