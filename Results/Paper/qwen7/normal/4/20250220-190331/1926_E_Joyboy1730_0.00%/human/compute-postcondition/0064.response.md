Postcondition: `L` must contain at least one element, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `tot` is less than `k` but `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`, `n` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`. If the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is not met, the values of `tot`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
