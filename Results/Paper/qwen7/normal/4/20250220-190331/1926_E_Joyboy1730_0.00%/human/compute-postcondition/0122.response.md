Output State: **`pow` is multiplied by 2, `k` is `k - tot`, `tot` remains unchanged, `L` is a list with at least 2 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
