Output State: **`L` is a list with at least 1 element, `tot` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `tot` is now `tot + a`.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. The other variables (`L`, `k`) remain unchanged. The condition mentioned in the postcondition (if `tot` is less than `k` which is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`) does not affect the current state since only `tot` has been updated.
