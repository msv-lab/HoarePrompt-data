Output State: **`pow` is multiplied by 2, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer minus `tot`, `L` is a non-empty list, `m` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. However, since the initial value of `pow` is not specified, we only know that it has been updated. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
