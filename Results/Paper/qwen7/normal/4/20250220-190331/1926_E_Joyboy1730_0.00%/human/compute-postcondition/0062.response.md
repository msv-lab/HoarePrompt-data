Based on the initial state provided:

- `L` contains at least one element.
- `pow` is 1.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is 0.
- `tot` is less than `k` but `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the first element of `L`.
- `n` is 0.

We need to determine the value of `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.

Given:
- `pow` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `k` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided, so we will keep it as `k`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{pow} * (2 * k - 1) = 1 * (2 * k - 1) = 2 * k - 1 \]

So, the print statement will output the value of \(2 * k - 1\).

Output: **2 * k - 1**
