Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

The code updates the value of `m` to be \((n + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
