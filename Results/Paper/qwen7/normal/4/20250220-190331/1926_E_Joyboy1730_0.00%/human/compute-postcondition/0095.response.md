Output State: **`m` is (n + 1) // 2, `L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, `n` is decreased by `m`, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decreased by `m`, where `m` is initially \((n + 1) // 2\). The other variables (`L`, `pow`, `k`, and `tot`) remain unchanged.
