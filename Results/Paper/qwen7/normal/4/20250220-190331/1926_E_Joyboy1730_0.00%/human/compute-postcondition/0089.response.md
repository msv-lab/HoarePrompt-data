Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, `m` and `n` are 0, and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `L`. All other variables (`pow`, `k`, `m`, `n`, and `tot`) retain their previous values or remain unchanged. Since `L` is now an empty list, `tot` remains the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`, which is 0.
