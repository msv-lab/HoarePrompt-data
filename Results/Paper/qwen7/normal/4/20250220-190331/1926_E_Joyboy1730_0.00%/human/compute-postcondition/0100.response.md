Output State: `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, which is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. Once `n` reaches 0, the loop terminates. At this point, both `m` and `n` will be 0, and the other variables (`L`, `pow`, `k`, and `tot`) remain in their initial or unchanged states as they are not modified within the loop.
