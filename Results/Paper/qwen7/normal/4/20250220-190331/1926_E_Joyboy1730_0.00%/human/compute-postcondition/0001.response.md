Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore) and the variable `t`. The underscore is typically used as a throwaway variable when the value is not needed, but it still indicates that the loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is an input integer, and its value is within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. This means `t` can take any integer value from 1 to 50000.

3. **Adjust the State for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be valid according to its constraints. Since the loop will run `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**
