Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer within the specified range.
