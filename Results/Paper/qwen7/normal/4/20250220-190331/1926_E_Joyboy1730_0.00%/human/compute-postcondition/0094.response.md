Output State: **`m` is (n + 1) // 2, `L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 0, `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L` which is 0 since `L` is empty.**

The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `L` is initially an empty list, its cumulative sum (`tot`) remains 0.
