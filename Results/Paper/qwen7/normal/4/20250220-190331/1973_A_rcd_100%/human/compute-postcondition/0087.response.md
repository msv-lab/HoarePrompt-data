Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3, and `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. Since `p3` is an integer and the conditions about `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, the updated state includes the new variable `y` which holds the value of `p3`. All other variables retain their original properties and values.
