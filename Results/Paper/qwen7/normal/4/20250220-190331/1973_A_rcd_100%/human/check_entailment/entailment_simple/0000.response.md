Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules. This check is correct.

3. **Initial Condition Check**: The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible score for `p3` if no draws occurred. This logic is correct.

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic aims to find the maximum number of draws. However, the logic has some issues:
   - The variables `x` and `y` are initialized incorrectly (`x = 0` and `y = p3`). They should be initialized to `p1` and `p2` respectively.
   - The loop condition `y >= x` is incorrect. It should be `y >= x and y >= 0`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the conditions for determining the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the increment and decrement operations on `x` and `y` do not align with the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
