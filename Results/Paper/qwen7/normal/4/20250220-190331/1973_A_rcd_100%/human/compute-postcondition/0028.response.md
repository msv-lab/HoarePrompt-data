Output State: **`x` is 1 or 2; `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `x` is either 0 or 1.
- The code `x += 1` increments `x` by 1. If `x` was 0, it becomes 1; if `x` was 1, it becomes 2.
- After the increment, `x` can only be 1 or 2.
- The condition that `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, `y` must still be greater than or equal to `x`, which is now 1 or 2.
