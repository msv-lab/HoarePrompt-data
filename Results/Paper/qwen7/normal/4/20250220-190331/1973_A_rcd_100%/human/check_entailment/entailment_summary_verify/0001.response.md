### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points Modulo 2:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules. This check is correct.

3. **Handling Special Case Where `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the special case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`. According to the problem, if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the maximum possible points for the third player should be `p1 + p2`, but this does not necessarily mean the scores are consistent. We need to consider the possibility of draws and other configurations.

4. **Calculating Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of points the first player lost due to draws and `y` is the number of points the second player lost due to draws.
   - The loop continues until `y >= x` and checks if the current configuration of `x` and `y` can satisfy the conditions.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is used to ensure the points distribution is valid, but it does not guarantee the maximum number of draws. The logic to find the maximum number of draws is flawed because it does not account for all possible configurations of games and draws.

5. **Handling Cases Where No Valid Configuration Found:**
   - If no valid configuration is found within the loop, the program prints `p3`. This is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the scores are inconsistent.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Handling of Special Case:**
  - The special case `p3 >= p1 + p2` needs to be handled by considering all possible configurations of games and draws. The program should check if the scores can be achieved by distributing points through a combination of wins, losses, and draws.

- **Finding Maximum Number of Draws:**
  - To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
    - Each draw gives 1 point to each player.
    - Wins give 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.
    - We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the total points match `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Check if the sum of points is even.
2. Handle the special case where `p3 >= p1 + p2` by checking all possible configurations.
3. Use a more systematic approach to find the maximum number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the sum of points is even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the total points available
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible points without draws
        max_points_without_draws = p1 + p2
        
        # If p3 is less than max_points_without_draws, it's impossible
        if p3 < max_points_without_draws:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum points needed from draws
        min_points_from_draws = p3 - max_points_without_draws
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min_points_from_draws // 2
        
        # Adjust for remaining points
        remaining_points = min_points_from_draws % 2
        
        # Ensure the remaining points can be distributed
        if remaining_points > 0 and (p1 - max_draws) < (p2 - max_draws):
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases and does not provide the maximum number of draws in all scenarios. The corrected version above addresses these issues.

**Final: False**
