Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p3` is at least 3, and either `x` is 1 with `y` being 0 (if `p1 - 1 <= p2 - 0`), or `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 (if `p1 - 1 > p2 - 0`)**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Initially, `x` is either 0 with `y` being 0 (if `p1 - 0 <= p2 - 0`), or `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 (if `p1 - 1 > p2 - 0`). After incrementing `x` by 1, `x` becomes 1 in both cases, and `y` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
