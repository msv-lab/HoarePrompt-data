Postcondition: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3. The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after all iterations, printing either `p1 - x + p3` when `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met or `p3` when `y < x`.**
