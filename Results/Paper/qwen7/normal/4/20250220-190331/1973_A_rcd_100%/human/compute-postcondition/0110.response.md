Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p3` is at least 3, and `y` is -1.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
