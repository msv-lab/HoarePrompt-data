You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            print(-1)
            continue

            print(p1 + p2)

                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break

                    x += 1
                    y -= 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: t is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is t, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3. The variable `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is -1. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds true at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` becomes -1, and it prints `p3` at the end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) under specific conditions. For each test case, it checks if the sum of \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) is even. If not, it prints -1 and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even and \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to \( p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). Otherwise, it enters a loop where it adjusts two variables \( x \) and \( y \) to find a valid solution, printing either \( p_1 - x + p_3 \) if a valid solution is found or \( p_3 \) if no valid solution exists. The function returns a value based on these conditions for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. Here’s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores 1, 1, and 2 can be achieved through the following games:
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1-1)
- Player 1 vs Player 3: Draw (1-1)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (2-0)

In this scenario, the maximum number of draws is 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs -1 for this case.

The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints -1 if true, which is unnecessary since the sum of points can be even or odd without affecting the possibility of draws. More importantly, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect. It attempts to find a combination of draws and wins that matches the given scores but fails to handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
