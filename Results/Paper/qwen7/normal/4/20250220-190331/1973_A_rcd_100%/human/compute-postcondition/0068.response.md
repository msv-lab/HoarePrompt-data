Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and either `x` is 0 with `y` being `p3 - 1` and `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`, or `x` is 1 with `y` being `p3 - 2` and `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
