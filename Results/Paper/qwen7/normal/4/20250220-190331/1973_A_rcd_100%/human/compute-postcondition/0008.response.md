Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we continue the loop or statement we were inside. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, no changes are made to the variables.
