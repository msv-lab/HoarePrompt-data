Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `y >= x`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is either 0 or 1.
   - `y` is either 0 or 1.
   - The loop breaks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
   - If `p1 - x > p2 - y`, then `x` is 1 or 2 and `y` is `x` - 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Given the possible values of `x` (0 or 1) and `y` (0 or 1), the only way `y` can be greater than or equal to `x` is if both `x` and `y` are 1.
   - If `x` and `y` are both 1, the loop condition `y >= x` will still hold true, allowing the loop to continue.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop continues is `y` must be 1.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`x` is either 0 or 1, `y` must be 1**
