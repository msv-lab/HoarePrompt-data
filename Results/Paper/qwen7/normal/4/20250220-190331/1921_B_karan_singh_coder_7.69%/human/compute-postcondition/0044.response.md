Output State: **The input value from `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `cnt` holds the count of mismatches between strings `s` and `t`, `i` is the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` is reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), the strings `s` and `t` remain the same as they were after the last iteration, and now `s` is updated to the new input string.**

This means that the input string is now stored in the variable `s`, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
