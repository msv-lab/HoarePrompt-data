Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \), and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state \( s \) into the desired state \( f \). If the number of '1's in \( s \) equals the number of '1's in \( f \), it outputs the number of differing positions if they are zero, otherwise, it outputs zero. If the number of '1's in \( s \) does not equal the number of '1's in \( f \), it computes the absolute difference and adjusts the count of differing positions accordingly before outputting the result.**
