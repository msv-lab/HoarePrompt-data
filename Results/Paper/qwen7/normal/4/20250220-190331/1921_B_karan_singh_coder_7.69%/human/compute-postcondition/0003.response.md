Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `t = input()` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but since the exact value of `t` is now determined by user input, we simply state that `t` is now an input integer. The values of `n` and `s` are left as they were initially.
