Output State: **`cnt` will hold the count of mismatches between strings `s` and `t`, `i` will be the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` will be reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), and the strings `s` and `t` will stay the same as they were after the last iteration. Additionally, `d` is equal to the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

This means that the variable `d` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
