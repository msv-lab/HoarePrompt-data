Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, `t` is a string input by the user, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `s1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, `s` is updated to the string input by the user, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
