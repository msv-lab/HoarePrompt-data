Output State: `cnt` will be the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` do not match, `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, `n` will be decreased by the number of iterations (which is the same as the final value of `i` + 1), and `s` and `t` will remain unchanged from their values after the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, `cnt` will hold the count of mismatches between strings `s` and `t`, `i` will be the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` will be reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), and the strings `s` and `t` will stay the same as they were after the last iteration.
