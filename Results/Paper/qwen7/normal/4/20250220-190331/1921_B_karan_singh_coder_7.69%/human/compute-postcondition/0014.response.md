Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 0.

In simpler terms, `cnt` will hold the total number of mismatches between the strings `s` and `t`, considering all `n` characters; the other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
