Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1.**

The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to `big_element`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `left` and `right` are still valid, and `small_element` is still `left + 1`.
