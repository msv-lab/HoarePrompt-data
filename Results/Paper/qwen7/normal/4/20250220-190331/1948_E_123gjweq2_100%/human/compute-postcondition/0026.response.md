Output State: The loop has executed `not_mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:

- `i` will range from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be set to `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` will be set to `big_element - i`.

In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `big_element - 0` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` placed starting from index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.

All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
