Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then calls the helper function `make_array` to fill the array `arr` and `cliquess` according to the specified rules.

2. **Helper Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` within the range `[left, right]` with elements and assigns the `clique` value to all elements in this range.
   - The logic inside `make_array` seems to split the range into two parts and fill them differently:
     - The first part fills elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
     - The second part fills elements from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

1. **Distinct Assignments**:
   - The assignment of values to `arr` ensures that all elements are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This is achieved by filling the array in a specific pattern that guarantees uniqueness.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is filled, the difference between indices and values will often satisfy this condition, forming cliques.

3. **Clique Partition**:
   - The `cliquess` array is used to assign each vertex to a specific clique.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that all elements in the same range (determined by `left` and `right`) are assigned the same clique number.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: the first line contains the values assigned to vertices, the second line contains the number of cliques, and the third line contains the clique assignments.

### Edge Cases and Validity

- The function handles the case where `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n).
- The logic in `make_array` ensures that the array is filled correctly and the cliques are formed as required.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement. It generates valid outputs that meet the criteria specified in the problem.

### Final Answer
