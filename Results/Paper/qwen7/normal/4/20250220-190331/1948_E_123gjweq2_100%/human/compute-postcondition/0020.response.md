Output State: **`i` is 2, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Initially, `i` is 1, so after the first iteration, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`. Now, `i` is incremented to 2, and `arr[left + mid + 2]` is updated to `big_element - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
