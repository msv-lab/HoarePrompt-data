You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` takes two integers `left` and `right` (where `0 <= left < right < n`), and one integer `clique`. It modifies two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place. Specifically, it fills a portion of the `cliquess` array with the value `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` and from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, where `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated based on `left`, `right`, `small_element`, and `big_element`. Additionally, it fills a portion of the `arr` array with values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order and from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` in ascending order. The function does not return anything.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then calls the helper function `make_array` to fill the array `arr` and `cliquess` according to the specified rules.

2. **Helper Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` within the range `[left, right]` with elements and assigns the `clique` value to all elements in this range.
   - The logic inside `make_array` seems to split the range into two parts and fill them differently:
     - The first part fills elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
     - The second part fills elements from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

1. **Distinct Assignments**:
   - The assignment of values to `arr` ensures that all elements are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This is achieved by filling the array in a specific pattern that guarantees uniqueness.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is filled, the difference between indices and values will often satisfy this condition, forming cliques.

3. **Clique Partition**:
   - The `cliquess` array is used to assign each vertex to a specific clique.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that all elements in the same range (determined by `left` and `right`) are assigned the same clique number.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: the first line contains the values assigned to vertices, the second line contains the number of cliques, and the third line contains the clique assignments.

### Edge Cases and Validity

- The function handles the case where `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n).
- The logic in `make_array` ensures that the array is filled correctly and the cliques are formed as required.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement. It generates valid outputs that meet the criteria specified in the problem.
