Output State: `mid` must be equal to its final value after all iterations, `i` will take on all values from 0 to `mid-1`, `cliquess[left + i]` will be `clique` for all `i` from 0 to `mid-1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be `small_element + i` for all `i` from 0 to `mid-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `mid` will hold its final computed value, `i` will have taken on every integer value from 0 up to but not including `mid`. The array `cliquess` will contain the value `clique` at every index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`. Similarly, the array `arr` will be filled such that for each index `j` from `left` to `left + mid - 1`, `arr[j]` will be equal to `small_element + (j - left)`.
