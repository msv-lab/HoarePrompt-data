### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to vertices such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
- The condition for adding an edge between vertices \( (i, j) \) is \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

#### Function `func_1`
- **Clustering Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)`.
- **Array Initialization**: It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
- **Helper Function Call**: It calls the `make_array` function to populate these arrays.

#### Helper Function `make_array`
- **Range Splitting**: The function `make_array` takes a range `[left, right]` and a clique identifier `clique`.
- **Array Population**: It populates the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays within the specified range.
  - The first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
  - The second half of the range is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Distinct Assignments**:
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the values assigned to `arr` are distinct and cover the entire range from 1 to `n`.
   - By splitting the range and filling it in a specific manner, the function guarantees that the values are unique and cover the entire range.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied due to the way `arr` is populated.
   - The values in `arr` are structured such that the differences between adjacent elements and indices are minimized, ensuring that many pairs of vertices will form edges.

3. **Clique Partition**:
   - The `cliquess` array assigns each vertex to a specific clique.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that all elements in the same range are assigned the same clique number, effectively partitioning the graph into cliques.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: the first line contains the values assigned to vertices, the second line contains the number of cliques, and the third line contains the clique assignments.

#### Edge Cases
- The function handles the specified range constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n).
- The logic in `make_array` ensures that the array is filled correctly and the cliques are formed as required.

#### Annotations Validation
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic is sound.
- The final state of the program aligns with the expected behavior, validating the correctness of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the detailed analysis and validation against the problem statement and the annotated code, the program correctly implements the solution.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**
