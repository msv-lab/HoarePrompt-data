Output State: **`i` is 3, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Initially, `i` was 2, and now it has been incremented to 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `not_mid` remains greater than 0, and the values of `cliquess[left + mid + 1]`, `cliquess[left + mid + 2]`, `arr[left + mid + 1]`, and `arr[left + mid + 2]` also remain as specified in the initial state.
