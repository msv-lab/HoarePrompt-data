Output State: **`i` is 0; `not_mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Since `i` is initially 0, `cliquess[left + mid]` is updated to `clique`. The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` remains unchanged and is still `big_element - i`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
