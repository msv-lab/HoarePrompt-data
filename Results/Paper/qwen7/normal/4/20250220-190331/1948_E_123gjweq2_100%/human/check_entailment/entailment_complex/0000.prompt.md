Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` based on the specified range and clique index.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `cliques * 2 - 1`, `make_array` is called `cliques` times with arguments `i * k`, `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, and `i + 1`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `cliques * 2 - 1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `cliques - 1`. The function `make_array` will have been called `cliques` times, each time with the appropriate arguments based on the current value of `i`.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [result of make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1) for i in range(cliques)]
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: cliquess (where cliquess is a list of length cliques, with each element being the result of make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to cliques - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2*n inclusive. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) as `ceil(n / k)`, initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess`, and fills `arr` using the `make_array` function based on the specified range and clique index. Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `i` will range from `0` to `mid - 1`.
    #- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique`.
    #- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in reverse order starting from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left`.
    #
    #All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `not_mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `i` will range from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
    #- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be set to `clique`.
    #- `arr[left + mid + i]` will be set to `big_element - i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `big_element - 0` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` placed starting from index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.
    #
    #All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` takes two integers `left` and `right` (where `0 <= left < right < n`), and one integer `clique`. It modifies two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place. Specifically, it fills a portion of the `cliquess` array with the value `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` and from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, where `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated based on `left`, `right`, `small_element`, and `big_element`. Additionally, it fills a portion of the `arr` array with values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order and from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` in ascending order. The function does not return anything.
