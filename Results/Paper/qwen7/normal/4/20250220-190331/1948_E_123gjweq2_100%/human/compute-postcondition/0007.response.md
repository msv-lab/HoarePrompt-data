Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mid` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < mid`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The condition `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` will now check `cliquess[left + 1]` (since `i` is now 1).
   - The condition `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i` will now check `arr[left + mid - 1 - 1]` (since `i` is now 1), which simplifies to `arr[left + mid - 2]`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `mid` remains the same and must still be at least 1.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is now `cliquess[left + 1]`.
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is now `arr[left + mid - 2]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`**.
