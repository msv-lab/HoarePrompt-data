You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `i` will range from `0` to `mid - 1`.
    #- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique`.
    #- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in reverse order starting from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left`.
    #
    #All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `not_mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `i` will range from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
    #- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be set to `clique`.
    #- `arr[left + mid + i]` will be set to `big_element - i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `big_element - 0` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` placed starting from index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.
    #
    #All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `left` and `right` (with `0 <= left < right < n`) and one integer `clique`, and returns nothing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
