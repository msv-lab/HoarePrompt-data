Output State: **`i` is 0; `not_mid` must be greater than 0; `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the element in the array `arr` at the index `left + mid + i` to be `big_element - i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `not_mid` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that the element at the specified index in the array `arr` is now set to `big_element - i`, which simplifies to `big_element` since `i` is 0.
