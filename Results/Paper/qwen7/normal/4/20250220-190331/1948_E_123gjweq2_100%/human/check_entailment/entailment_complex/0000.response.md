Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n`.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, filling `arr` and `cliquess` according to the rules specified in `make_array`.
   - The output format matches the requirements: it prints `arr`, the number of cliques, and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly fills `arr` and `cliquess` based on the specified ranges and values.
   - It ensures that the elements within each segment of `arr` and `cliquess` are distinct and follow the required pattern.
   - The logic for determining `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` is correct.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program handles the constraints and requirements correctly.
   - The logic for generating the array `arr` and the partition `cliquess` is sound.
   - The output format is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program meets the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
