Output State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `cliquess[left + i]` becomes `cliquess[left]`, which is updated to `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged.
