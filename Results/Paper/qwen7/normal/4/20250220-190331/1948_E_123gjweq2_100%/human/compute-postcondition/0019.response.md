Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `not_mid` must be greater than 0.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < not_mid`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - `not_mid` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The conditions for `cliquess[left + mid + i]` and `arr[left + mid + i]` will change because `i` will now be 1.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `not_mid` must still be greater than 0.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` (which is now `cliquess[left + mid + 1]`) will be equal to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` (which is now `arr[left + mid + 1]`) will be set to `big_element - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`**.
