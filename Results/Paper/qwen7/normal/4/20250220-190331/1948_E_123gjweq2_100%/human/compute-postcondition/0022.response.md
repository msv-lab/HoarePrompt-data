Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < not_mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `not_mid` must be greater than 0
   - `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`
   - `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`
   - `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `not_mid` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` becomes 4
   - `not_mid` remains greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - The other states (`cliquess[left + mid + 3]`, `arr[left + mid + 1]`, and `arr[left + mid + 2]`) remain the same as they are not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2**
