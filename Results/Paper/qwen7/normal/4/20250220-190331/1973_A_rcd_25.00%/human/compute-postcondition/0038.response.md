Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`. After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be set to `high` if the loop completes without breaking, or it will be set to the value that satisfies the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` when the loop breaks. The loop will print either `p1 - cur + p3` when the condition is met or `p3` if the loop completes without finding such a `cur`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `cur` will be either `high` or the value that makes `p1 - cur` less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, whichever comes last during the loop's execution. The loop will print either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition is met before the loop ends, or it will print `p3` if no such `cur` is found.
