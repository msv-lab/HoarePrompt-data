Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is defined as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `p1 - cur + p3`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- Since `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it means `p3 < p1 + p2`.
- The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are such that their sum is even, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must result in an even number.
- `low` and `high` are derived from the differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Given that `high` is the maximum of these two values and must be greater than or equal to `cur`, we know that `high` is at least `cur`.

However, the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `p1 - cur + p3`. But we can describe it in terms of the variables involved.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p2, p3, and cur are the respective values from the input)**
