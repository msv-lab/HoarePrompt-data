Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t` is set to `k-2`.
   - `p1` is an input integer.
   - `p2` is an input integer.
   - `p3` is an input integer.
   - `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the variables involved in the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- `p1` is an input integer.
- `p3` is an input integer.
- `cur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a value such that `high` (which is greater than or equal to `cur`) is valid.

Since `cur` is not explicitly defined and only the condition that `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `cur`. However, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` will be evaluated with the values of `p1` and `p3`, and `cur` will be some value that satisfies the condition for `high`.

Given this, the output will be the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`, where `cur` is some value that makes `high` valid.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are input integers and cur is some value such that high is greater than or equal to cur)**
