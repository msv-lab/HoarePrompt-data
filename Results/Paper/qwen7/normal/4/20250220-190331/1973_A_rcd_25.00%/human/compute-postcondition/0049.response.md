The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, and it is compared against `high` in the condition `high >= cur`. The current state of `cur` is `low`, and `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `cur` (which is `low`) must satisfy the condition `high >= cur`. Given that `low` is already defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Let's break it down:

1. `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
2. `high` is defined as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.

Since `low` is the minimum of the two values and `high` is the maximum of the two values, `low` will always be less than or equal to `high`. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, or `high`.

However, we need to ensure that the loop condition `high >= cur` holds true. Since `cur` is `low` and `low` is always less than or equal to `high`, the condition will naturally hold true without any adjustments.

Thus, no state adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `low`**
