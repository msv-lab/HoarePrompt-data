Reasoning:

1. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) is even. If not, it prints -1, which is correct because an odd sum would mean an impossible distribution of points since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).

2. **Direct Sum Condition**: If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the program prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is correct because if the highest score is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores, it implies that all points could be from draws and the remaining points distributed as wins/losses. However, this logic needs further refinement to ensure correctness.

3. **Binary Search-like Adjustment**: The program attempts to find a valid number of draws using a binary search-like approach. It sets `low` and `high` based on the differences between \( p_3 \) and \( p_1 \) and \( p_3 \) and \( p_2 \). It then iteratively adjusts `cur` within the range `[low, high]` to check if a valid configuration exists. 

   - **Condition Check**: The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to ensure the scores are consistent with the number of draws. This condition is correct but needs to be checked more rigorously to ensure it covers all edge cases.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly prints 2, but the correct answer should be -1 because it's impossible to achieve such scores without violating the rules of the game.
   - The program does not handle cases where the scores are inconsistent properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

Given the above analysis, the program has logical flaws and does not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
