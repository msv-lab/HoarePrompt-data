Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`. After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be equal to `high`.

To understand why `cur` ends up being equal to `high`, let's analyze the loop:

1. The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
3. If the condition is false, `cur` is incremented by 1.
4. This process repeats until `cur` reaches `high` or the condition inside the loop becomes true.

Since the loop continues as long as `high >= cur` and increments `cur` by 1 each time the condition is false, `cur` will eventually reach `high` if the loop does not break earlier due to the condition being true. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be equal to `high`.
