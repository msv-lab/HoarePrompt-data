Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following input:

- Input: `1 1 10`

According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws for this scenario is 2. However, the program outputs 2, which seems correct at first glance. But let's analyze further:

1. For `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, the total points are 12. This means there must be a combination of wins and draws that sum up to these points.
2. The only way to achieve `p3 = 10` with the minimum number of games is through a combination of wins and draws. Since `p1` and `p2` are both 1, they must have drawn against each other and won against `p3`. This would mean:
   - One draw between `p1` and `p2`.
   - Five wins for `p3` (since `p3` needs 10 points and can only win by 2 points per game).

However, the program does not account for the possibility of multiple draws among the players. To maximize the number of draws, we need to consider scenarios where more than one game ends in a draw. 

For instance, if `p1` and `p2` each draw with `p3` once, and then `p3` wins the remaining games, the maximum number of draws would be 2 (one between `p1` and `p3`, and one between `p2` and `p3`).

The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
