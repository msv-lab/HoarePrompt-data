Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is increased by 1, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions. Therefore, `t` remains `k-2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain as input integers, `low` is still `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, which now is `cur + 1`.
