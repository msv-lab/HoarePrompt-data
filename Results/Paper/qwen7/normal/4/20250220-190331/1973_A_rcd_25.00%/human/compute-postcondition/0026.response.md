Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` remains as `low` and the condition is met. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `high + 1`.

3. **Determine Which Variables Need Adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves `high` and `cur`. Therefore, these are the variables that need to be adjusted.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know `cur` has either remained as `low` or been updated to `high + 1`. Therefore, `cur` could now be `low` or `high + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `high` must still be greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `cur` can be either `low` or `high + 1`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low` and `high + 1`.

Given this, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.**
