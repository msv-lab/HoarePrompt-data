Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `low`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions plus the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
