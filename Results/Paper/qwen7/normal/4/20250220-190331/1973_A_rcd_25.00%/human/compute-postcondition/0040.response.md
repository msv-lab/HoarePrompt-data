Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged, and after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be either `high` or the value that makes `p1 - cur` less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, whichever comes last during the loop's execution. The loop will print either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition is met before the loop ends, or it will print `p3` if no such `cur` is found.
