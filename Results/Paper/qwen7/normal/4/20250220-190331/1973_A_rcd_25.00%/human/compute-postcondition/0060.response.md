Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the only effect is that the program exits the hypothetical loop or if statement it was in. None of the variable values change due to the `break` statement itself. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain as they were in the initial state, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
