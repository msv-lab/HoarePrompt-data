Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` must be greater than `cur + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(p1 - cur + p3)
   ```

Given the conditions, let's analyze the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- `p1` and `p3` are integers from the input split.
- `cur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be an integer. Since `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `high` must be greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` must be less than `high - 1`.

To determine the exact value of `p1 - cur + p3`, we need to consider the relationship between `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`:

- Since `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and considering the constraints on `low` and `high`, `p3` is positioned such that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are meaningful differences.
- `low` and `high` are derived from these differences, and `high` is specifically greater than `cur + 1`.

However, without the exact value of `cur`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `p1 - cur + p3`. But we can describe the expression in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p3, and cur are as defined in the initial state)**
