Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `k-2`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `cur` remains as `high` regardless of whether `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` holds true or not.

The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are input integers)**
