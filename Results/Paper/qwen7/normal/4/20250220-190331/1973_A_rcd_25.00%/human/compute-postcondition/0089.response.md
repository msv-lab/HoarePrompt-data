Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is `k-2`
   - `p1` is an input integer
   - `p2` is an input integer
   - `p3` is an input integer
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - The loop condition is `high >= cur`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Increment Condition:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

4. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `high >= cur` must hold true.
   - If `high >= cur` is true, the loop will continue.
   - If `high >= cur` is false, the loop will break.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `high` and `cur`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `high` is the only variable in the loop head that directly affects the loop condition, we need to ensure `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`**
