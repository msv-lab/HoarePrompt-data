Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is defined as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.
   - `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `p1 - cur + p3`.

3. **Determine the Value of `cur`:**
   - Since `cur` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, it takes the smaller value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` must hold true. This implies that `cur` is chosen such that this condition is satisfied.

5. **Expression Simplification:**
   - Substitute `cur` into the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:
     \[
     p1 - \min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) + p3
     \]

6. **Final Expression:**
   - If `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, then `cur = p3 - p1`, and the expression becomes:
     \[
     p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 + p3 = 2p1
     \]
   - If `p3 - p2` is smaller than `p3 - p1`, then `cur = p3 - p2`, and the expression becomes:
     \[
     p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 + p3 = p1 + p2
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The expression simplifies to either `2p1` or `p1 + p2`, depending on the value of `cur`.

Given the conditions, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` will either be `2p1` or `p1 + p2`. However, without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we cannot determine which one it will be precisely. But based on the structure of the problem, the expression will evaluate to one of these two forms.

Output: **2p1 or p1 + p2 (where p1, p2, and p3 are integers such that their sum is even and p3 < p1 + p2)**
