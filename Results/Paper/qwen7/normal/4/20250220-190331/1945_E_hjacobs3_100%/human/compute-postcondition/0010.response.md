To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. This means that the loop continues as long as the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than 1.

### Current States
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
- `l` is either `mid` or 0.
- `r` is either `n` or `mid`, depending on whether `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find`, respectively.
- `mid` remains as `(0 + n) // 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Values of `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` can be either `mid` or 0.
   - `r` can be either `n` or `mid`.

2. **Loop Condition `r - l > 1`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `r - l` must be greater than 1.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible values of `l` and `r`:

- If `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, then `r - l = n - 0 = n > 1` (assuming `n > 1`), which satisfies the loop condition.
- If `l` is `mid` and `r` is `n`, then `r - l = n - mid > 1` (assuming `n - mid > 1`), which satisfies the loop condition.
- If `l` is 0 and `r` is `mid`, then `r - l = mid - 0 = mid > 1` (assuming `mid > 1`), which satisfies the loop condition.
- If `l` is `mid` and `r` is `mid`, then `r - l = mid - mid = 0`, which does not satisfy the loop condition.

From the above analysis, the only way the loop can continue is if `r - l > 1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`.

### Adjusted States
- `l` must be such that `r - l > 1`.
- `r` must be such that `r - l > 1`.

Since `l` and `r` depend on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find`, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`.

### Final Answer
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` must be such that `r - l > 1`, `r` must be such that `r - l > 1`, and `mid` remains as `(0 + n) // 2`**.
