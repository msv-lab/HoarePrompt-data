Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps. Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
5 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

- The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The number to find is `3`.

The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. Initial state: `l = 0`, `r = 6`.
2. First iteration: `mid = 3`, `array[3] = 5`. Since `5 > 3`, set `r = 3`.
3. Second iteration: `mid = 1`, `array[1] = 3`. Since `3 == 3`, the loop ends.

At this point, `l` is still `0`, and the element at index `l` is `4`, which is not equal to `3`. The function returns `0` indicating no swaps are needed, but it fails to move `3` to the position `l`.

To fix this, the function should check if the element at `l` is equal to `x`. If not, it should perform the necessary swaps to move `x` to the position `l`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l] != find:
        # Find the index of the element to swap with
        swap_index = array.index(find)
        # Perform the swap
        array[l], array[swap_index] = array[swap_index], array[l]
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(swap_index + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

This corrected function ensures that the element `x` is moved to the position `l` after at most 2 swaps, satisfying the problem requirements.
