Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described in the problem statement and the execution summary. Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is implemented incorrectly. The initial values for `l` and `r` should be set to 1 and `n + 1`, respectively, as per the problem statement. However, in the given code, they are initialized to 0 and `n`.

2. **Swapping Elements**: The program only checks if `find` is at index `l` and swaps with the correct index if necessary. However, the problem requires performing at most two swaps to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search. The current implementation only handles the case where `find` is not at `l` and performs a single swap, which may not be sufficient in all cases.

3. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem statement requires printing the number of operations and the indices for each swap. The current implementation only prints "1" or "0" and returns a list of indices without specifying the number of operations.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
