Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1.**
