Postcondition: **Output State: The array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. The loop has terminated because `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `l` and `r` are adjacent indices in the array. The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.**
