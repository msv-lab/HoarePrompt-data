Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` is 0, `r` is n, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range defined by `l` and `r`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + n) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
