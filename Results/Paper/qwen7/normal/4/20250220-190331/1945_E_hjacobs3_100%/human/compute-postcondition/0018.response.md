Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` is unchanged, `r` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, and `r - l > 1` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = mid` updates the value of `r` to be equal to `mid`. The calculation of `mid` as `(l + r) // 2` remains unchanged, and the condition `r - l > 1` also remains true. The list `array` and the variable `l` are not affected by this operation.
