Output State: **`l` is now equal to `mid`, `r` remains unchanged, and `r - l > 1` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code `l = mid` updates the value of `l` to be equal to `mid`. The calculation of `mid` as `(l + r) // 2` and the condition `r - l > 1` being true are still valid after the assignment. The value of `r` remains unchanged.
