### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a permutation array `p` of size `n` and a target value `x` that needs to be found.
- We need to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` after the binary search.

#### Provided Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if (l != array.index(find)):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The `func_1` function performs a binary search to find the target `x` in the array.
- If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and returns the indices of `l` and `array.index(find)` incremented by 1.
- If `array[l]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the required functionality because it does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps.
- The assessment suggests a corrected version of the function that explicitly checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x` and performs the necessary swaps.

#### Corrected Version:
The suggested correction involves finding the index of `x` in the array and swapping it with `l` if they are not already equal. This ensures that `array[l]` is `x` after at most 2 swaps.

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l] != find:
        # Find the index of the element to swap with
        swap_index = array.index(find)
        # Perform the swap
        array[l], array[swap_index] = array[swap_index], array[l]
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(swap_index + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

#### Evaluation:
- The original program indeed does not ensure that `array[l]` is `x` after the binary search, as it only checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x` without performing any swaps if they are not.
- The suggested correction addresses this issue by explicitly checking and swapping if necessary.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not meet the requirement of ensuring that `array[l]` is `x` after at most 2 swaps, and the suggested correction fixes this issue.

### Final:
**False**

The original program is incorrect, and the suggested correction is necessary to meet the problem requirements.
