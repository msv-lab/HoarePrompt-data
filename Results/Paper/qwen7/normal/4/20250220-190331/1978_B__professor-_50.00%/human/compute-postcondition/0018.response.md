Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Let's break it down:

1. `2 * b`: This is twice the value of `b`.
2. `- n + 1`: Subtract `n` from `1` and then add this result to the previous step.
3. Multiply the result by `n`: This multiplies the result from the previous step by `n`.
4. Divide by `2`: Finally, divide the result by `2`.

Given these steps, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{Result} = \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \]

This expression represents a specific mathematical formula involving `b` and `n`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of this expression evaluated with the values of `b` and `n` provided as inputs.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
