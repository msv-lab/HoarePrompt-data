Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the last set of inputs provided by the user for each iteration. The loop processes each of the `t` test cases sequentially, updating `n`, `a`, and `b` with the new inputs for each case.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` which initially represented the number of test cases will be reduced to 0 since all cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last test case input because the loop updates these variables with the new inputs for each iteration.
