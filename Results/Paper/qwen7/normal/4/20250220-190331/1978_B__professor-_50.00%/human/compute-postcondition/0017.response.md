Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The print statement is `print(n * a)`. This means it will print the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first input integer and a is the second input integer)**
