Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
   - `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.
   - `b` is assigned the third integer from the input.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `b - a >= n`.

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration:**
   - If `b - a >= n`, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If `b - a < n`, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` in either case (whether `b - a >= n` or `b - a < n`), these variables remain the same for the next iteration.
   - The only thing that changes is the decrement of `t` by 1 because the loop runs `t` times.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 1 initially and is decremented by 1 each iteration).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
