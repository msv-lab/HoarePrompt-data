Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `a` is updated to the second input integer, `b` is updated to the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial conditions for `t` and the nature of `n`, `a`, and `b` as input integers remain unchanged.
