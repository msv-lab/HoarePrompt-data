### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - The program uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `b` and `a`, and the value of `n`.

3. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \):**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the program prints `n * a`.
   - This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.

4. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n - 1)`. This is correct because it represents the total revenue from selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices.

5. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \(b - a + 1\) terms (which is the number of buns sold at the modified price) plus the revenue from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. However, there is a mistake in this formula. The correct formula should be \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * (n - (b - a))\).

Let's verify the correct formula for this case:
- The number of buns sold at the modified price is \(k = b - a + 1\).
- The number of buns sold at the usual price is \(n - k = n - (b - a)\).
- The revenue from the first \(k\) buns is \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
- The revenue from the remaining \(n - (b - a)\) buns is \(a * (n - (b - a))\).
- Therefore, the total revenue is \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * (n - (b - a))\).

The given program incorrectly omits the term \(a * (n - (b - a))\) in the final calculation.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the revenue from the remaining buns sold at the usual price in the third case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the omission of the term \(a * (n - (b - a))\) in the third case.
