Postcondition: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1), `ans` is a list of n zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1` which is not equal to '>', `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`.**
