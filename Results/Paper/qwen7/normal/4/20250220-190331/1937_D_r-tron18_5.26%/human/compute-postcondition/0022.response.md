Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `totalOne` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
