The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. However, based on the parameters, it seems the function might be evaluating the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and returns the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string. If the number of '<' characters is greater than the number of '>' characters, it returns a positive value; if the number of '>' characters is greater, it returns a negative value; if they are equal, it returns 0.**
