Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise equal to the length of `pre`; `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list containing indices `i+1` for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is equal to `s1[i]`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**

In more detail:
- The value of `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to the list. This means the last element of `suffZero` is added to `i + 1` and the result is appended to `suffZero`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
