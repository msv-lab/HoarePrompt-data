Postcondition: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if the character `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element. `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1). `ans` is a list of `n` zeros. Depending on the condition `len(suffZero) - 1 <= totalOne`, the i-th element of `ans` is either updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)` if `len(suffZero) - 1 <= totalOne`, or twice the last element of `preOne` otherwise.
