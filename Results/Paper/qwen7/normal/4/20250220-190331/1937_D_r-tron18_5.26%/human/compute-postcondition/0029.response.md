Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1), `ans` is a list of n zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1` which is not equal to '>', `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` by calculating it as twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `oneInd` will be twice whatever `func_1(preOne, zr)` returns. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
