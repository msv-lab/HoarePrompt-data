Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`**

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Here, `ol` is `totalOne`, so `zeroInd` becomes `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. The values of `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
