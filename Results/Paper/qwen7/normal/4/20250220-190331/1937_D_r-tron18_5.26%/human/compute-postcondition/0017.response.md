Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between two function calls `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`. This difference is assigned to the variable `fi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
