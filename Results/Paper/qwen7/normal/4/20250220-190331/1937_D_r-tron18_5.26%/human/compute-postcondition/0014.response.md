Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, and `ol` is greater than `zr`.**

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * suffZero[-1]`. Since `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `suffZero[-1]` is 0. Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * 0`, which results in `zeroInd` being 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
