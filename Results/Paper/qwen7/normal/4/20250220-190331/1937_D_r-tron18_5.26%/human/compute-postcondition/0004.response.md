Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This means that every element in `ans` is set to 0. All other variables (`totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
