Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise equal to the length of `pre`; `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list containing indices `i+1` for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `i` updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`; `i` is `i - 1 + 1 = i`; `el` is equal to `s1[i]`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is updated to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is updated to `2 * preOne[-1]`; `suffZero` now has one more element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated using the updated `suffZero` and `preOne` lists. The `suffZero` list is also updated with one more element. All other variables retain their previous values.
