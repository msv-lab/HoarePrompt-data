Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. The other variables (`n` and `u`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, and `v` is now an integer from the input decreased by 1.
