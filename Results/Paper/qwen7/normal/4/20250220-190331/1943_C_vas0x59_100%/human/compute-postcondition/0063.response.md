Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, after executing the line `ops.append((c1, i))`, the value of `i` increments by 1 (becoming 2), and the list `ops` now contains the tuple `(c1, 1)`. The precondition that `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements remains unchanged.
