Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 3, `u2vs[v]` contains the value `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Since `u2vs[v]` was previously set to contain the value `v` (as per the initial state), now it will contain both `v` and `u`. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial state.
