Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` will be set to `2 * ci + 1`. Since `ci` is not explicitly defined, let's assume it starts as `0` for simplicity. Thus, if the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` will become `1`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` will be set to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. Again, since `ci1` is not explicitly defined, let's assume it starts as `0` for simplicity. Thus, if the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` will be `len(path_ba) - 1`.
   - `ops` will be constructed based on the above conditions:
     - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` will be a list of tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, inclusive. Since `ci` is `1`, `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`.
     - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` will be a list of tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element is every odd number starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. Since `ci1` is `0`, `ops` will contain tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element is every odd number from 1 to `len(path_ba) - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple as a string in the form `'c + 1 i'`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the map object into individual strings, and `sep='\n'` ensures that each string is printed on a new line.

Given the initial state, let's consider both cases:

- **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is odd:**
  - `ci` becomes `1`.
  - `ops` will be `[('c', 0), ('c', 1)]`.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    c 0
    c 1
    ```

- **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is even:**
  - `i` becomes `len(path_ba) - 1`.
  - `ops` will be `[('c1', 1), ('c2', 3), ('c1', 5), ...]` (alternating between `c1` and `c2`).
  - The output will be:
    ```
    c1 1
    c2 3
    c1 5
    ...
    ```

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, the problem does not specify which case applies, so we should consider the general form.

Output: **c 0\n c 1 (if the length of path_ba is odd)\nc1 1\nc2 3\nc1 5\nc2 7\nc1 9\nc2 11... (if the length of path_ba is even)**
