Output State: **`ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, ci + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is defined as `ci + 1`, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c, ci + 1)`. The initial state of `ops` having a new element appended means that the last element of `ops` is now updated to include `c` and `ci + 1`. All other variables remain in their original state.
