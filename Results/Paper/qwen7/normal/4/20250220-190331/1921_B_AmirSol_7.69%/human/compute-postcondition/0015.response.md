Output State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the characters at index `i` in strings `s1` and `s2` are the same.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
