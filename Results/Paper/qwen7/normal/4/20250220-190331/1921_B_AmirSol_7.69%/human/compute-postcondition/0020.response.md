Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 2, making it either 3 or 4 (since `i` was initially either 1 or 2). The values of `counter`, `n`, and the condition involving `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` remain unchanged.
