Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 3, 4, or 5, `n` must be greater than 4, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` can now be 3, 4, or 5 (depending on its original value). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
