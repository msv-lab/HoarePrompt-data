Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, `n` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` becomes 2 and `i` changes to either 2, 3, or 4; otherwise, `counter` remains 1 and `i` stays as either 2 or 3.
