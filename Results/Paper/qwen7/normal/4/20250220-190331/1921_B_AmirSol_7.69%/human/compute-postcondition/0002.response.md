State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i < n`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`.
4. Since `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0 to satisfy the condition `i < n`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.
