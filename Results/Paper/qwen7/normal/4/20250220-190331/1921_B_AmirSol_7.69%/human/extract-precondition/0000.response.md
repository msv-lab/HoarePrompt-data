Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where the i-th character of s1 is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise, and the i-th character of s2 is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.**
