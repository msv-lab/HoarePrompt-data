Output State: **The final value of `counter` will be the total number of positions from 0 to n-1 where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. The value of `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. `n` will remain the same as the initial value, and both `s1` and `s2` will retain their original string values.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `counter` will hold the count of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, signifying that the loop has processed all elements up to the last index. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
