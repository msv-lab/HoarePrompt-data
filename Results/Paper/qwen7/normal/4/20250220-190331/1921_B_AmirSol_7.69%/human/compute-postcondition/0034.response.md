Postcondition: **`counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is either 3, 4, or 5, `n` must be greater than 4, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**.

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the final state of the variables adheres to the specified constraints.
