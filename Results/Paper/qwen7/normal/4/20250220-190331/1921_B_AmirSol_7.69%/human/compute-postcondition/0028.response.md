Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while i < n`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
   - `i` is either 2, 3, or 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently either 2, 3, or 4, and `n` is greater than 2, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that `i` remains less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is already in the range [2, 4], the only way to guarantee that `i < n` is to ensure that `n` is greater than 4.

5. **Final State**:
   - We do not need to change the values of `counter`, `i`, or the condition involving `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` because these do not affect the loop condition.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**.
