Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula aims to find the maximum number of draws by subtracting the minimum possible points from the total points and then dividing by 2.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Formula for Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used in the program does not correctly account for the constraints and possibilities of the scoring system.
   - Specifically, the term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should consider the distribution of wins and draws more carefully.

2. **Handling of Scores:**
   - The program does not properly handle the distribution of wins and draws to ensure the scores are achievable.
   - The formula used might not always yield the correct maximum number of draws.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
  - Result: `0 / 2 = 0` (correct)

- **Example 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
  - Result: `2 - 0 = 2` (should be 1, not 2)

- **Example 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
  - Result: `-1` (correct)

- **Example 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
  - Result: `4 - 1 = 3` (should be 2, not 3)

- **Example 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
  - Result: `-1` (correct)

- **Example 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
  - Result: `12 - 2 = 10` (should be 6, not 10)

- **Example 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
  - Result: `12 - 8 = 4` (should be 2, not 4)

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical errors in calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
