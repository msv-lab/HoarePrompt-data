Output State: **t is 0, and for each iteration i (where 0 ≤ i < t), `v[i]` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `result[i]` is calculated as `(v[i][0] + v[i][1] + v[i][2] - max(0, v[i][2] - v[i][0] - v[i][1])) // 2` if the sum of the first three elements of `v[i]` is even. If the sum is odd, `-1` is printed instead.**

In this final state, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed. For each iteration `i` where `0 ≤ i < t` (which means there were originally `t` iterations but now `t` is 0), `v[i]` represents the list of integers entered by the user during that iteration, and `result[i]` contains the calculated result based on the given formula if the sum of the first three elements of `v[i]` was even. If the sum was odd, `-1` was printed during that iteration and no result was stored.
