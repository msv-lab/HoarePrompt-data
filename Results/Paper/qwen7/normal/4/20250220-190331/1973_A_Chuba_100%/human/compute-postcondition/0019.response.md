Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`. This implies that `t` is set to a value that is one less than its previous value. However, since no specific value for `t` was initially given, we can only refer to it as `t - 1`.
- `v` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated string input. The actual content of this list is not specified, but we know it is a list of integers derived from user input.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('-1')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `-1`.

Output: **-1**
