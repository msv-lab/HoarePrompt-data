Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1; `v` is a list of integers, `result` is (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `result` using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as "decreased by 1". The list `v` remains unchanged, and `result` is calculated based on the elements of `v`.
