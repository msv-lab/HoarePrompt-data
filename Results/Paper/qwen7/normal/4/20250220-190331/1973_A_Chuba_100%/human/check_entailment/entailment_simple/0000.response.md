Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as a list of integers.
3. The program checks if the total score (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is even. If it is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total).
4. If the total score is even, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that each draw gives 1 point to each player, and the difference in scores between the highest and lowest scores must be covered by wins and losses.

The logic in the program is sound and matches the problem description. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is correct, as it ensures that the scores are achievable through a combination of wins and draws.

Correctness: **True**
