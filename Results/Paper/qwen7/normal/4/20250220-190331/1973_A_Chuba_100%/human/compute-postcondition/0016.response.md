Postcondition: `t` is decreased by 1; `v` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated string input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, `t` remains unchanged after the condition check. Otherwise, `t` is decreased by 1 and `v` is adjusted such that `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
