Output State: **`v` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `v`. Since the actual input values are not specified, `v` is described as a list of integers entered by the user. All other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
