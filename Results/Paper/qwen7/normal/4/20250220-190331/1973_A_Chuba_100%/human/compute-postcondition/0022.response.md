Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `v` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated string input, and `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` if `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `t` remains `t - 1` and `result` is undefined.
