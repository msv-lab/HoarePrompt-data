The function reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is even, it calculates two values: \(x\) as half of the sum and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\). If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). After processing all test cases, the function sets the counter \(t\) to 0. The final output consists of the results for each valid test case.
