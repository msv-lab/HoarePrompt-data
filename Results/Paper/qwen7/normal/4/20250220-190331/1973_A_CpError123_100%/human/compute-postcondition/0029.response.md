Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is the last integer entered by the user during any iteration of the loop, `b` is the last integer entered by the user during any iteration of the loop, `c` is the last integer entered by the user during any iteration of the loop, `x` is the integer value of (`a` + `b` + `c`) divided by 2, `y` is `a` + `b`.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` will still hold its initial value (which was an integer between 1 and 500), but `a`, `b`, and `c` will each hold the values entered during the last iteration of the loop. The variables `x` and `y` will also reflect the values calculated based on these final inputs.
