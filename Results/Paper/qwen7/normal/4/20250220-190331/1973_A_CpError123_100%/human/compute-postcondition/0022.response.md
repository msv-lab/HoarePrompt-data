Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the actual values are not provided, they are represented as integers entered by the user. Other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
