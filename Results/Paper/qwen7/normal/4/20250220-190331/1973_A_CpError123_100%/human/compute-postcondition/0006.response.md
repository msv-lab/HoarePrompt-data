Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. We continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. The conditions and values of the preconditions also persist.
