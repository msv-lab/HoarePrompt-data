Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2, `y` is `a + b`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
