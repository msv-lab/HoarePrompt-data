Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. They remain as integers entered by the user, and the program continues as if the `continue` statement was not there.
