Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**.

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
