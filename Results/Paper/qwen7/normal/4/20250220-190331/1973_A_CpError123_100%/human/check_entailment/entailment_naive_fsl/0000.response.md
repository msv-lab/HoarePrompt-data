Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the program fails to consider the constraints and conditions necessary to determine the maximum number of draws accurately.

For instance, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores `1, 1, 2` can be achieved with 2 draws (one draw between the first and second player, and another draw between the second and third player), but the program outputs `-1`.

The program checks if the sum of the scores is even and then calculates `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`. However, it does not properly account for the distribution of wins and losses required to achieve the given scores. The program should consider the following:

- The total number of games played.
- The distribution of wins and draws to ensure the scores are consistent.

A correct approach would involve checking the feasibility of the scores and calculating the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints.
