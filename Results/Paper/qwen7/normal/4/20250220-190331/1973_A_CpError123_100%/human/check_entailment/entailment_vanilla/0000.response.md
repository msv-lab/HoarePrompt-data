Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 1 point to each player in a draw).
   
3. **Calculating Maximum Possible Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents half of the total points, which can be distributed among the games.
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of draws is simply the minimum of `x` and `y`. However, this does not necessarily give the maximum number of draws.
   - The correct approach should consider the distribution of points more carefully. Specifically, the maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the points are distributed such that the number of draws is maximized while still satisfying the constraints.

2. **Handling Cases with No Draws:**
   - The program does not handle cases where no draws are possible correctly. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 2`, the program will output `1` (which is incorrect since no draws are possible).

### Example Analysis:

- **Case: `0 0 0`**
  - Sum is `0`, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
  - Output: `0` (correct).

- **Case: `0 1 1`**
  - Sum is `2`, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Case: `1 1 1`**
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1` (correct).

- **Case: `1 1 2`**
  - Sum is `4`, which is even.
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`.
  - Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `1`).

- **Case: `3 3 3`**
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1` (correct).

- **Case: `3 4 5`**
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`.
  - Output: `6` (incorrect, should be `4`).

- **Case: `1 1 10`**
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`.
  - Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `4`).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
