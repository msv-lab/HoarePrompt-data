Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points (1 to each player in a draw).

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The program calculates \(x\) as half of the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). However, these calculations do not directly help in determining the maximum number of draws.

3. **Determining Maximum Draws**: To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the constraints:
   - Each draw gives 1 point to each player, contributing 2 points in total.
   - Each win/loss scenario gives 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, contributing 2 points in total.
   
   Therefore, the total number of points (sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)) must be distributed such that the number of draws is maximized. The key is to maximize the number of 2-point contributions from draws while ensuring the remaining points are distributed through wins/losses.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the total points: \(total\_points = a + b + c\).
   - Calculate the minimum points a player could have if they won all their games: \(min\_wins = 2 \times \text{number of opponents} - 2\).
   - Calculate the maximum possible draws: \(max\_draws = \frac{\text{total\_points} - \text{min\_wins}}{2}\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the sum is odd, return \(-1\).
   - If the configuration is impossible (e.g., \(a + b < c\)), return \(-1\).

Given these considerations, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
