Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
