Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `s` is a set containing `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contains `arr[i + 1]`. After adding `arr[i]` to `s`, `s` now contains both `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. The condition `i < n` remains unchanged.
