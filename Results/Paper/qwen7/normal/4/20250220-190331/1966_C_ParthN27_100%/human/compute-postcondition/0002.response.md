Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking input from the user, splitting the input into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
