Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the same as the original list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. This means that the first element of the list `s` becomes `0`, and the rest of the elements remain the same as they were before. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation.
