Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`, `ans` is 1, and `s` is a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr` with 0 at the beginning.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the list `s` to the variable `n`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`. The value of `ans` remains 1. The list `s` is still a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr` with 0 at the beginning.
