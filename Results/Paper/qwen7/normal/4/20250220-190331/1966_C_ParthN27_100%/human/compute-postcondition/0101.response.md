Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 1, `s` is an empty set, and `arr` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

The code `s = set()` creates an empty set `s`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
