Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`; `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, after the operation, the list `s` will start with `0` followed by the original elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n-1`.
