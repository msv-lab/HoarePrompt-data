Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `s` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the same as the original list `s`. If `n` is equal to 2, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 if the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was met at least once for some `i` in the range from 1 to `n-2`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1.
