Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 1, and `s` is a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr` with 0 at the beginning, `arr` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps each string to an integer, resulting in a list of integers. This list replaces the original `arr`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
