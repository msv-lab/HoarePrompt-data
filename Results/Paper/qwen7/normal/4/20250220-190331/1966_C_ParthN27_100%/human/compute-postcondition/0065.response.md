Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, the list `s` is a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr`, and `s` has been modified to include 0 at the beginning.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr`, after the modification, `s` remains a sorted list but now starts with `0`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
