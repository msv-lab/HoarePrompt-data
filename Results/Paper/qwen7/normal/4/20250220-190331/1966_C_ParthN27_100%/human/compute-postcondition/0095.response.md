Postcondition: **The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking, the value of `i` is `n - 1`, and the variable `ans` is toggled based on whether the `else` block was executed. If `ans` was 1 before the `else` block, it remains 1. If `ans` was 0 before the `else` block, it becomes 1 after the `else` block is executed.**
