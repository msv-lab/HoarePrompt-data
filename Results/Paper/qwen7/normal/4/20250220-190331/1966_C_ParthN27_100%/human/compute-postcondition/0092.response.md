Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking, so the value of `i` is now `n - 1`.
- The variable `ans` is 1.
- The if condition evaluates to true because `ans` is non-zero.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This will print the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
