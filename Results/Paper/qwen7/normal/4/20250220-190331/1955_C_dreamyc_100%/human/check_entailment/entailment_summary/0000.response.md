Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining how many ships sink after the Kraken attacks them in a specific pattern.
2. The provided code defines a function `func_1` which seems to be intended to solve this problem, but there are some issues with the logic and implementation.
3. The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the number of ships that sink. It sums up the elements from the start and end of the list independently and checks if these sums are less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. This does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern.
4. The function should simulate the Kraken's attacks iteratively, reducing the durability of the ships and checking if they sink, rather than just counting indices based on cumulative sums.
5. Given the execution summary, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to simulate the Kraken's attacks as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and therefore cannot accurately determine the number of ships that sink.
