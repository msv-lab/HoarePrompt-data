Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is math.ceil(k / 2), `b` is k // 2.**

The code calculates two new variables, `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` is set to the ceiling of `k / 2`, which means `a` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`. Variable `b` is set to the integer division of `k` by 2, which means `b` is the largest integer less than or equal to `k / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
