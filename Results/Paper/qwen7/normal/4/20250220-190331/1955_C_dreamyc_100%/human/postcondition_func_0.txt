The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (which is `k // 2`). If the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the count of such indices `i`.
