You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans` will be the count of indices `i` where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`. The variable `s_b` will hold the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `i` will be equal to `n` after all iterations.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (`math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (`k // 2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (which is `k // 2`). If the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the count of such indices `i`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the alternating pattern of attacks on the first and last ships. Instead of decrementing the durability of the ships according to the Kraken's pattern, the function simply checks if the cumulative durability of the first `a` and last `b` ships is less than or equal to the respective attack counts `a` and `b`. This approach does not account for the fact that ships sink and are no longer subject to further attacks once their durability reaches zero.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly counts the number of ships that would sink without properly simulating the Kraken's attacks. The correct implementation should maintain a list of ships and simulate the attacks iteratively, updating the durability of the ships and removing them from consideration once they sink.
