Output State: **`counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `i` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is `b[0]`, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans` is updated to `b[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
