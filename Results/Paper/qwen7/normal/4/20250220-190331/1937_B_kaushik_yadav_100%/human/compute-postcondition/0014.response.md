Output State: **`work` is False, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is the first character of string `a`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False` by the code. All other variables retain their previous states as per the initial conditions.
