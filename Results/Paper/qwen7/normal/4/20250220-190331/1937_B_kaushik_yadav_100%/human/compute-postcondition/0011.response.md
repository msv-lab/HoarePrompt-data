Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is the first character of string `a`, `work` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
