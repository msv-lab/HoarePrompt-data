Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` followed by either `b[i]` or `a[i+1]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is either `i + 1` or `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
