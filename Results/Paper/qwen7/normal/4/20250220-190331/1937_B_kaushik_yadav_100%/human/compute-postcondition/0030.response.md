Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by `a[i]`, and `work` is set to `False`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the list `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `ans` is updated to contain the first character of `a` (which was already in `ans`) followed by the second character of `a`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
