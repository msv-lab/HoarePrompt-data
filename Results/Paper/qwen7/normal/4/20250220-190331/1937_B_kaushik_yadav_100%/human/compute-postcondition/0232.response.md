Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` concatenated with either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0. If `work` is `True` and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if-else block continues.
