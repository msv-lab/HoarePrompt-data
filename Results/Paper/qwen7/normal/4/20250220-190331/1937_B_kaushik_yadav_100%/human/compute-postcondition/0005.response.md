Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
