State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are binary strings, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `_` is used in the loop head but does not require adjustment since it is a dummy variable.
2. The loop runs `t` times, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
3. For each iteration of the loop, `n` must be at least 2 to ensure there are valid binary strings of length `n`.
4. The binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, and their lengths must match `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `n`, ensuring that the loop can execute. The binary strings and the input method (`input` being set to `sys.stdin.readline`) do not affect the loop's ability to run.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5**
