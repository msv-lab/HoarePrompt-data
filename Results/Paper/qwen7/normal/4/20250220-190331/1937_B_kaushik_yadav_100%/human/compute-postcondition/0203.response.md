Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes the first character of `b`. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 1 (assuming typical behavior where `i` is updated after the assignment). All other variables remain unchanged.
