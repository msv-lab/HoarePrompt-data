Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]`, and `work` is set to `False`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the first character of `a` followed by `a[i]`. After executing the code, `ans` will now contain the first character of `a`, followed by `a[i]`, and then the character at index `i` of `b`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `work` remain unchanged.
