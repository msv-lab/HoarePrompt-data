Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, and `work` is set to `False`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is 0, and the loop or if-else block has been executed without breaking out of the most internal loop or if-else block. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False` or `True` if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, `j` is 1, and the program either sets `work` to `True` if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False` or `True` if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, `j` is 2, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
