Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It constructs a new string `ans` based on specific comparison rules between `a` and `b`. After constructing `ans`, it prints the string. Additionally, it counts the number of consecutive positions where `a[j + 1]` matches `b[j]` and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
