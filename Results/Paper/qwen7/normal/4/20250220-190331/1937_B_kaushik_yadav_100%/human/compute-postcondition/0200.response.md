Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 2, `work` is `False`. If `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans` plus `b[1]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains the first character of `a`.**
