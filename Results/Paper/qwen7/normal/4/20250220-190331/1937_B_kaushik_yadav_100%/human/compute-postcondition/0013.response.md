Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is the first character of string `a`, `work` is set to True, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than the current value of `a[i + 1]`.
