Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these two binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic for processing the binary strings is not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value.
