Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
