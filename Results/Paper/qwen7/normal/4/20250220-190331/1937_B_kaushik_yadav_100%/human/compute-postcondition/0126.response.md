Postcondition: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]` if `work` is `False` and `b[0]` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise when `work` is `True`, `i` is either 2 if `work` is `False` and `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0; if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside, otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 if `work` is `False` and remains `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`.
