Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` concatenated with `b[i]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0; `ans` is updated to include `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the current value of `ans` with the character `b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
