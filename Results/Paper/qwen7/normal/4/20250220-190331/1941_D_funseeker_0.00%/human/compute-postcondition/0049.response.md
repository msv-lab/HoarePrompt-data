Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in ans`. This means the variable `q` is the only one being adjusted in each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `ans` is a set that contains at least one element, and it now includes `(q + r) % n`.
   - `temp` is a set that includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
   - `q` is `x`.
   - `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and its current value is either '1' or '?'.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `q` must be taken from the set `ans`. Since `q` is the variable being adjusted in the loop, the new value of `q` will be the next element in the set `ans`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `q`. The other variables (`ans`, `temp`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and its current value is either '1' or '?'**.
