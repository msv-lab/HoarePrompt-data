# Problem:
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

Each of the following m lines contains an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') indicating the distance and direction of the throw, respectively.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. For each of the m lines, r_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1, and c_i is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_2():

    #The program returns an integer value calculated by the function func_1(), which depends on the initial values of t, n, m, x, r_i, and c_i.

#Function 3:

For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. Each of the next m lines contains an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.
def func_3():

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the initial player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c of each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).

These elements will be a combination of all unique results generated from the operations \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each iteration, starting with the initial set containing `x`. Each element in `ans` will be derived from the initial `x` through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n`, based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. The final state of `ans` will include all possible combinations of these operations, reflecting the complete execution of the loop for `m` iterations.
