Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `q` in the line `for q in ans:`. This means the only variable that can be adjusted is `q`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `ans` contains the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` contains both `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

3. **Determine the Value of `q` at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was equal to `x`.
   - Since `q` is iterating over the set `ans`, it will take on each element of `ans` in subsequent iterations.
   - Given the postcondition, `ans` contains `x` and potentially other elements, but the key point is that `q` will be reassigned to `x` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `q` will be reassigned to `x` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `temp` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect `q` being reassigned to `x`.

**State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`**.
