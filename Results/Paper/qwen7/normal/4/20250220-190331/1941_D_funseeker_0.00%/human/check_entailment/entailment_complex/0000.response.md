Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads a line from standard input and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace.
   - This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Calls `func_1()` and returns the result as an integer.
   - This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Calls `func_1()` and splits the returned string into a list of integers.
   - This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - Iterates `m` times, reading the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw.
   - Updates the set `ans` based on whether `c` is '0', '1', or '?'.
   - Ensures that if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n`.
   - Prints the size of `ans` and the elements in `ans`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated functions, let's verify the correctness of `func_4`:

- **Initialization**: The set `ans` starts with the initial player `x`, which is correct.
- **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates `m` times, reading the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw. It updates the set `ans` by adding the new possible positions based on the direction. This logic is correct.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n`. This ensures that the set always contains valid player numbers.
- **Output**: The function prints the size of `ans` and its elements, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Based on the above analysis, the implementation of `func_4` correctly processes the throws and updates the set of possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
