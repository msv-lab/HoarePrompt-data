Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contains `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Since `q` is equal to `x`, the new element added to `temp` is `(x + r) % n`, which is already present in `temp`. However, the set data structure ensures that duplicate elements are not stored, so the set remains unchanged in terms of its contents. Therefore, the updated state of `temp` includes all three expressions: `(x + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`.
