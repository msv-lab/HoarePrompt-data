Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r`, `c` are strings obtained from splitting the return value of `func_1()`**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c` respectively. Since `func_1()` returns a single string, `.split()` without any arguments splits the string into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter. The values of `ans`, `x`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, but now `r` and `c` are defined as the split parts of the string returned by `func_1()`.
