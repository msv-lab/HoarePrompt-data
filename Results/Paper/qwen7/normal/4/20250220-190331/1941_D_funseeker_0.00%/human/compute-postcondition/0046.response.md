Output State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `q` is `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contains the value of `(q + r) % n`. After executing the line `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, `temp` now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
