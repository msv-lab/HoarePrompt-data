Output State: **The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop executes all its iterations, excluding the element `0`; `ans` contains the element `n`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements, excluding the element `0`. After executing `ans.add(n)`, the set `ans` now includes the element `n` in addition to the original \(2^m - 1\) elements.
