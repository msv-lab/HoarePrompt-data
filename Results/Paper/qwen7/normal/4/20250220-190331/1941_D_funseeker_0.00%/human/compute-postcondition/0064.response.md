Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements.
- The elements consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\).
- `q` is the last element in the set `ans`.
- `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which is a common convention in Python when the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
- The loop runs `m` times.

### Adjusting States:
Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only variables that can be adjusted are those mentioned in the initial state. However, since the loop does not directly modify these variables, the values of `ans`, `q`, `r`, and `c` remain the same for each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The states of `ans`, `q`, `r`, and `c` do not change during the execution of the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

### Final State:
The state remains the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify the variables `ans`, `q`, `r`, and `c`.

**State: **`ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'**.
