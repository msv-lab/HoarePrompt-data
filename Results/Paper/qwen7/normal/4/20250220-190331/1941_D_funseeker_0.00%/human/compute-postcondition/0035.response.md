Output State: **`ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`, `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.

This means that the variables `ans`, `q`, and `temp` retain their initial values and structure. The variables `r` and `c` are assigned the first and second values returned by the function `func_1().split()`, respectively.
