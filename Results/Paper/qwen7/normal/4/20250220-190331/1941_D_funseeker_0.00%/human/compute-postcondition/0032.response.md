Output State: The set `ans` contains the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `ans` still contains the integer `x`, and `q` remains `x`. The set `temp` contains the following elements:
- `(x + r) % n`
- `(x - r) % n`
- `(x + r) % n` (repeated from the previous iteration)
- `((x + r) % n + r) % n`
- `(((x + r) % n + r) % n - r) % n`

These elements are added based on the conditions in the loop, where `c` can be either '1' or '?'.
