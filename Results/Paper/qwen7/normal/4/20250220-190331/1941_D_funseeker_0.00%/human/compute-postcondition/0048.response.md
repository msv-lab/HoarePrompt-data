Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `q` is `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.

This means that regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?', the sets `ans` and `temp` will include the necessary elements, and the values of `q`, `r`, and `c` will be as specified, with `c` being either '1' or '?'.
