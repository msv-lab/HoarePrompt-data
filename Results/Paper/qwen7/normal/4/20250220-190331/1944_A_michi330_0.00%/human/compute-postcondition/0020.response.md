Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being the initial input integer (an integer within the range 1 to 1000), `i` being `t + 1`, `n` being the first input integer from the first iteration, and `k` being the first input integer from the first iteration. No further changes have been made to `n` and `k` throughout the loop's execution.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value, `i` is incremented to `t + 1`, and `n` and `k` remain the same as they were in the first iteration of the loop. The loop does not modify these values unless explicitly stated within the loop, which it does not do in this case.
