You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being the initial input integer (an integer within the range 1 to 1000), `i` being `t + 1`, `n` being the first input integer from the first iteration, and `k` being the first input integer from the first iteration. No further changes have been made to `n` and `k` throughout the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - Initially, there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) bridges connecting all pairs of islands.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can only use existing bridges to travel to other islands.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This means all bridges except those connecting to island 1 can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`. This implies that fewer than `n - 1` bridges can be destroyed, so Everule can still visit all other islands.

3. **Checking Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `k >= n - 1`
     - If `k` is large enough to destroy all bridges except those connecting to island 1, then Everule can only visit island 1.
     - This matches the logic in the code.
   - **Case 2:** `k < n - 1`
     - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then Everule can still visit all other islands because fewer than `n - 1` bridges can be destroyed.
     - This also matches the logic in the code.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `2 0`
     - `k = 0`, which is less than `n - 1` (which is 1). Output should be `2` (both islands reachable).
   - **Example 2:** `2 1`
     - `k = 1`, which is exactly `n - 1` (which is 1). Output should be `1` (only island 1 reachable).
   - **Example 3:** `4 1`
     - `k = 1`, which is less than `n - 1` (which is 3). Output should be `4` (all islands reachable).
   - **Example 4:** `5 10`
     - `k = 10`, which is more than `n - 1` (which is 4). Output should be `1` (only island 1 reachable).
   - **Example 5:** `5 3`
     - `k = 3`, which is less than `n - 1` (which is 4). Output should be `5` (all islands reachable).
   - **Example 6:** `4 4`
     - `k = 4`, which is exactly `n - 1` (which is 3). Output should be `1` (only island 1 reachable).

The given solution correctly handles all edge cases and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
