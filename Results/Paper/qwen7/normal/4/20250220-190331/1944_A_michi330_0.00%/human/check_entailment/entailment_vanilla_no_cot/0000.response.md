Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** When \( k \geq n - 1 \), the program correctly prints `1`, which means it assumes Everule can only stay on island 1.
   - **Case 2:** When \( k < n - 1 \), the program incorrectly prints `n - 1`. It should consider the optimal way to destroy bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), the optimal strategy for Dominater is to destroy bridges such that Everule cannot reach more than one additional island beyond island 1. This can be achieved by destroying bridges in a way that isolates one island from the rest while keeping island 1 connected to at least one other island.

3. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct approach would be to check how many islands can still be reached after optimally destroying \( k \) bridges. Specifically, if \( k \geq n - 2 \), Everule can only visit 1 island (island 1). Otherwise, Everule can visit \( 1 + \left\lceil \frac{k}{n-2} \right\rceil \) islands.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 2:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of islands Everule can visit
            reachable_islands = 1 + (k + 1) // (n - 2)
            print(reachable_islands)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the number of islands Everule can visit is calculated correctly based on the optimal bridge destruction strategy.
