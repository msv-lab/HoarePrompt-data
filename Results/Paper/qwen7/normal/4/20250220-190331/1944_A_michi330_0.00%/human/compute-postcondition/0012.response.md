Output: **n - 1 (where n is the input integer converted from input)**

Explanation:
- `t` is at least 1, so it is a positive integer.
- `i` is defined as `t + 1`, meaning `i` is `t + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer, which is converted from user input.
- `k` is an input integer, also converted from user input, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The print statement `print(n - 1)` will output the value of `n` minus 1.
- Therefore, the output will be `n - 1`, where `n` is the input integer converted from user input.
