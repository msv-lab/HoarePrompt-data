Output State: **`queue` is now a deque containing the tuple of the next node and its distance, `current` is the start node, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

The code `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `queue` and assigns it to `current` and `dist` respectively. Since the initial state of `queue` was a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, after removing this tuple, `current` is assigned the value of `start` and `dist` is assigned the value `0`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
