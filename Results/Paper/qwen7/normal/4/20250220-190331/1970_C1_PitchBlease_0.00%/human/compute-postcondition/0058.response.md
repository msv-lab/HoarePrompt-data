Output State: **`queue` now contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, and `current` is set to one such neighbor; `visited` now includes the neighbor of `current`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. The `current` node's neighbor (`neighbor`) and the distance (`dist + 1`) are added to the queue. The conditions about `tree[current]`, `visited`, and `current` remain unchanged.
