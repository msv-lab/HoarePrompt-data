Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, indicating that there are no more nodes to process. The `current` variable holds the last node that was processed, which could be the `target` node or any other node that has all its neighbors visited. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been visited during the entire traversal, ensuring no node is visited more than once. The `dist` value represents the shortest distance from the initial node to the `current` node.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` is empty because all reachable nodes have been processed, the `visited` set includes all nodes that can be reached from the start node, and the `current` node is the last node visited, which is the closest leaf node to the start node if the target node was not found earlier.
