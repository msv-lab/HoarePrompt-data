Output State: **`queue` contains a new element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the neighbor is now in `visited`, and `current` remains as the current node in the tree.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now includes this new element. The other conditions and states remain unchanged.
