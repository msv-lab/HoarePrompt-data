Output State: **`current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `neighbor` is the next element in the adjacency list of `current`, `queue` now contains tuples of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `visited` now contains `neighbor` and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that `neighbor` is now marked as visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
