Output State: **`current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.**

In this output state, the `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` that was previously not in it, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
