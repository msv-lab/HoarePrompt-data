Output State: **The program returns -1**

This means that after processing all nodes and checking all reachable nodes, the algorithm did not find the target node. The `queue` being empty indicates that all nodes have been processed, the `visited` set contains all reachable nodes, and `dist` represents the shortest distance to the `current` node, which in this case is -1 since the target node was not found.
