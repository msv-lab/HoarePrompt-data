Reasoning:
1. **Tree Construction**: The `func_1` function correctly constructs the tree using an adjacency list representation.
2. **Leaf Identification**: It correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree.
3. **Distance Calculation**: The `bfs` function is used to calculate the shortest path distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves. This is done correctly.
4. **Winning Condition**: The function checks if either of the distances is even. If so, it returns "Ron", indicating that Ron wins because he would have the last move. Otherwise, it returns "Hermione", indicating that Hermione wins because she would have the last move.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the logic in `func_1` aligns perfectly with the rules of the game. Since the `bfs` function also works as expected, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
