n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is a list of integers representing the starting node for each round. Each tuple in edges contains two integers u and v such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, indicating an edge between nodes u and v. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.
