You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where tree[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, indicating that all nodes have been processed. The `current` variable holds the last node that was processed, which is likely the target node if the algorithm found it. The `visited` set contains all nodes that are reachable from the `start` node, ensuring no node is visited more than once. The `dist` value represents the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, which is the final distance to the target node if found, or the distance to the furthest reachable node otherwise.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` is empty, meaning no nodes are left to process. The `visited` set includes all reachable nodes, and `current` holds the last node processed, which could be the target node or the furthest node reachable from the start. The `dist` value gives the shortest distance to the `current` node, which is the final distance to the target if found.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 in Case_1 and Case_2, the shortest distance from the initial node to the current node in Case_3, and -1 in Case_4. Therefore, the functionality of the function `bfs` is to perform a breadth-first search from the `start` node to find the shortest path to the `target` node, returning 0 if the target is not found, the shortest distance if the path is found, and -1 if an error occurs or the conditions are not met.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 0

Case_3: The program returns the shortest distance from the initial node to the current node.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
