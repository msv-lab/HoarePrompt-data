Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, and `current` is set to one such neighbor; `visited` now includes the neighbor of `current`.**

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. Since `current` was previously set to a neighbor that is not in `visited`, after adding this neighbor to `visited`, `current` is still set to a neighbor that is not in `visited`, but now `visited` includes this neighbor.
