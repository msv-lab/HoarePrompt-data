Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is start, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. The `current` variable remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The `dist` variable also remains unchanged since the code does not modify its value. All other variables (`start`, `target`, and `visited`) remain the same as their initial states.
