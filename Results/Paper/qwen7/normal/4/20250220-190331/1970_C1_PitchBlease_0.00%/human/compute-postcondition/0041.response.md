Output State: **`current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `neighbor` is the next element in the adjacency list of `current`, `queue` now contains tuples of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) and `neighbor`, `visited` now contains `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the distance from the current node to the neighbor node is updated by adding 1 to the original distance (`dist`). The `neighbor` node is also added to the `visited` set, indicating that it has been visited. The values of `current` and `neighbor` remain unchanged.
