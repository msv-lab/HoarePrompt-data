Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, and `current` is set to one such neighbor. After the if else block executes, either `queue` contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) and `visited` includes the neighbor of `current`, or no changes occur in `queue` and `visited`.
