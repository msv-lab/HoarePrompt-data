Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`, `ans2` is the result of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**.

Explanation: The line `pair_idx = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `pair_idx`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_item_idx` is still 3, `pair_idx` is now 2, `i` is still 2, and the results of the function calls `ans1` and `ans2` remain the same as they were before the assignment.
