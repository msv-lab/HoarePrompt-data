Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, and `ans2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `pair_idx = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `pair_idx`. All other variables (`max_item_idx`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
