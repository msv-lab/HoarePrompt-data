Postcondition: `max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`. If `ans` equals '<', then `max_item_idx` remains 2, `i` remains 2, and `ans` remains the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the value of `ans`.
