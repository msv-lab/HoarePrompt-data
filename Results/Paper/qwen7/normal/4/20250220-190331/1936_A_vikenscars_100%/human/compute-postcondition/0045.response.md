Postcondition: `max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, and `ans2` remains unchanged. If `ans1` equals '<', then `max_item_idx` is set to 3 and `pair_idx` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
