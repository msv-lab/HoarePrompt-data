Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, and `ans2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` to the result of calling `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, which translates to `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`. The values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `ans2` was only defined if `ans1` was '=', and there is no information indicating that `ans1` is now '=', `ans2` remains unchanged.
