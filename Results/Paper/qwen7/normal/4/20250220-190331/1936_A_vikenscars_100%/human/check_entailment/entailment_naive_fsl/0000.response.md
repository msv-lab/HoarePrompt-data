Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee finding the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed 3n queries. The logic in `func_2` seems to focus on finding the index with the highest bitwise OR value but does not ensure that the pair found maximizes the XOR value.

Here's a potential case where the program might fail:
Consider the permutation \(p = [0, 1, 2, 3]\). The maximum XOR value is \(3 \oplus 2 = 1 \oplus 3 = 3\). However, the program might not find this pair because it focuses on finding the index with the highest OR value and then finds another index with the highest OR value relative to the first one, without ensuring the XOR is maximized.

A more robust approach would involve comparing pairs directly to find the maximum XOR value, rather than just focusing on individual indices.
