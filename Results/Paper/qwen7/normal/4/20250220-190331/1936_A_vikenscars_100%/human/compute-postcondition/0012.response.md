Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `max_item_idx` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Postcondition**: The postcondition does not change based on the value of `ans` because there is no else part in the given conditional logic. Therefore, `max_item_idx` and `ans` remain as they are.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `max_item_idx` remains 2
- `i` becomes 3
- `ans` remains the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`

So, the final state is:

State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**
