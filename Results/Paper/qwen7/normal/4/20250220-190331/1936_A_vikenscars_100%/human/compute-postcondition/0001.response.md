State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 1 and `n` should be greater than 1.
3. The initial value of `max_item_idx` (which is 0) does not affect whether the loop will execute or not, as long as the conditions for `i` and `n` are met.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
