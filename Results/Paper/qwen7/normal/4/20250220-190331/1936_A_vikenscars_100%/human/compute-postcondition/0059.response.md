Output State: **max_item_idx is 3, pair_idx is 2.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., from 0 to n-1), the variable `max_item_idx` remains unchanged at 3 because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `pair_idx` will be set to the last value of `i` that was processed inside the loop, which is `n-1`. Given that the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, the final value of `pair_idx` will be `n-1`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can express the final value of `pair_idx` as `n-1`, but based on the information given and the pattern observed, we can infer that after 3 iterations, `pair_idx` is 2, implying that `n` is 3. Therefore, the final state is `max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 2.
