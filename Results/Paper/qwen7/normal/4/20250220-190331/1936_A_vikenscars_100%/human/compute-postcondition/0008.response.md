Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called with arguments `1`, `1`, `2`, and `2`. The value returned by `func_1` is now stored in the variable `ans`. The other variables retain their initial values.
