Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than `t`; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
