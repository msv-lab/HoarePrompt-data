Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list where each element's count has been incremented by the number of times it appears in `s` (after processing the current input), `r` is an empty string, `s` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, and the next input is ready to be processed.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `i` is the first element of the list `s`; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`; `r` is increased by `a[x]`; `b[x]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `r` is increased by `a[x]`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is the updated value of `r + a[x]`, `b[x]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `x` is 2, `b[2]` is updated by adding 1 to its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
