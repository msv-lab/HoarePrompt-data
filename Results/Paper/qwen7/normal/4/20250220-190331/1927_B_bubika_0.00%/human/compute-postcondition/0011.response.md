Output State: **`b` is a list, `i` is an element in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in `s` calculated using `b.index(i)`**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` assigns the index of `i` in the list `b` to the variable `x`. The initial state of `i` being an element in `s` and `x` being the index of `i` in `s` remains unchanged, but now `x` also holds the index of `i` in the list `b`.
