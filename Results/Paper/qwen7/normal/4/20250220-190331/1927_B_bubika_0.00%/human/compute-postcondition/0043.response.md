Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and must be less than N; `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `r` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `r`. Since no operations are performed on `t` or `s`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `r` and retains the initial states of `t` and `s`.
