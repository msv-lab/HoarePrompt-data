Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Information:
- The loop is defined as `for t in range(int(input())):`.
- This means that the loop will iterate based on the number of times the user inputs an integer.
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- No specific details about the variables `r`, `a`, `b`, or `s` are given at the end of the previous iteration. However, we know that the loop will continue until the input value for `t` is exhausted.

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop variable `t` is used to control the number of iterations.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is within the range specified by `int(input())`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Loop Control Variable**: The loop control variable here is `t`.
2. **Identify the Input**: The loop will run for the number of times specified by the user input.
3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range specified by the user input.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `t` must be less than the user input value.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the user input value**.

If we denote the user input value as `N`, then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is N-1 (if it was N-1 before the last iteration) and must be less than N**.
