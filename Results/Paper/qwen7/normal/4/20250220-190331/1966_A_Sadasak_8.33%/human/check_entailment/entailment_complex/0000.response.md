Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through each test case using a loop. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - If \( k > n \), the program prints \( n \). This is correct because if \( k > n \), you cannot form any group of \( k \) cards, so you cannot reduce the number of cards further than \( n \).
   - If \( k == n \), the program prints \( k - 1 \). This is also correct because if \( k == n \), you can only form one group of \( k \) cards and exchange them for \( k - 1 \) cards, but since \( k == n \), you can only do this once, leaving you with \( k - 1 \) cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the list `arr` while ensuring no frequency exceeds `k`. This is done correctly by updating the `frequency_table` dictionary.
   - The function returns the `frequency_table`, which contains the count of each unique number in `arr`, with all counts capped at `k`.

4. **Final Output Determination**:
   - After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is in the values of `frequency_table`. If it is, it prints \( k - 1 \). Otherwise, it prints \( n \).
     - If `k` is in the values of `frequency_table`, it means that at least one type of card can be completely exchanged, reducing the total number of cards by \( k - 1 \).
     - If `k` is not in the values of `frequency_table`, it means no complete exchanges can be made, so the minimum number of cards remains \( n \).

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
