Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where multiple groups of `k` identical cards exist, and the optimal strategy involves reducing the count of one group while keeping others intact.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 3
2 2 2 3 3
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to exchange the three '2's for two new cards, resulting in a final count of 2 cards. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Instead, it uses a function `func_1` to limit the frequency of each card to `k`, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum number of cards.

To illustrate, in the test case above, the function `func_1` would limit the frequency of '2' to 3, but it does not reduce the count optimally. The correct approach should involve a more complex strategy to minimize the number of cards, such as repeatedly exchanging groups of `k` identical cards until no further reduction is possible.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
