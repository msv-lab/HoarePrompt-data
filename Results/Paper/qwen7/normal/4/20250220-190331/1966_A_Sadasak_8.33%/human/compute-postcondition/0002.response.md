Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is 1 if `num` was not already in `frequency_table`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table`. Initially, `num` is the first element of `arr`. If `num` is not already in `frequency_table`, it is added with a count of 1. If `num` is already in `frequency_table`, its count is incremented by 1.
