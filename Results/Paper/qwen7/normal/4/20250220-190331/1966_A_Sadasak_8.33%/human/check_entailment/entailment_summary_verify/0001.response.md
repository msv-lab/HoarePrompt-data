### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly implemented. It sets the frequency of any number to `k` if it exceeds `k`, but this is not required for solving the problem.

2. **Incorrect Condition in Main Program:**
   - The main program checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table using `if k in freq.values()`, which is not the correct approach. Instead, we need to check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than `k` or if we can achieve exactly `k` cards.

To address these issues, we need to revise the program to correctly determine the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations.

### Revised Program

The revised program should:
1. Count the frequency of each card.
2. Check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than `k` or if we can achieve exactly `k` cards.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than k
    min_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        if count >= k:
            min_cards = min(min_cards, count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1))
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - We use a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each card number.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cards:**
   - For each frequency `count` in `freq.values()`, we calculate the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.
   - If `count` is greater than or equal to `k`, we use the formula `count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1)` to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected program, the original assessment was accurate. The original program had logical errors and did not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
