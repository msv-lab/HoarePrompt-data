Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers.
   
2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot even choose `k` cards, you can't perform any exchanges, so the number of cards remains `n`.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because if `k` equals `n`, you can exchange all `n` cards for `k-1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the program calls `func_1` to get the frequency table and checks if `k` exists in the values of this table. If it does, it prints `k - 1`. If not, it prints `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function creates a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It ensures that no value exceeds `k` by setting frequencies greater than `k` to `k`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is unnecessary for solving the problem. The problem only requires checking if `k` can be achieved as a frequency, not limiting the frequencies to `k`.

4. **Checking if `k` can be a frequency:**
   - The condition `if k in freq.values()` is not correctly implemented. We need to check if we can reduce the number of cards to `k` or less by performing exchanges.
   - Instead of checking if `k` is a value in the frequency table, we should check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than `k` or if we can achieve exactly `k` cards.

### Correct Implementation

The correct approach would be to:
- Count the occurrences of each card number.
- Check if any card can be reduced to less than `k` or if we can achieve exactly `k` cards.

### Revised Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Check if we can reduce the count of any card to less than k
    min_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        if count >= k:
            min_cards = min(min_cards, count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1))
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has an incorrect implementation for determining the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
