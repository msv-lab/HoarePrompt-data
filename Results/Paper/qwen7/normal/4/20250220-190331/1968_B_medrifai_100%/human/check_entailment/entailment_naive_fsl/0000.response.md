Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum prefix length of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle cases where the characters do not match. 

Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
5 4
10011
1110
3 5
100
11010
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
3
```

For the second test case, the program incorrectly finds a subsequence length of 3, whereas the correct subsequence length should be 2 because the prefix "100" of string `a` does not form a valid subsequence in string `b`.

The issue lies in the function `func_1`, which uses `b[j:].find(a[i])` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the remaining part of `b`. This approach does not correctly handle cases where the characters do not match, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, we should directly compare characters and move the indices accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        if a[i] == b[j]:
            i += 1
            j += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    print(c)
```

This corrected version ensures that the characters of `a` and `b` are compared directly, and the indices are moved only when there is a match, thus correctly identifying the maximum prefix length of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.
