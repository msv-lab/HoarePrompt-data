Output State: **`index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`, `a` is a binary string, `b` is a binary string, `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= len(a), `j` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= j <= len(b)**.

This means that the variable `index` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the substring `a[i]` within the substring `b[j:]`. The lengths and types of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the constraints on `i` and `j` also remain the same.
