Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not needed for the print statement).
   - `r` is an input value from the user, but its specific value is not provided.
   - `prev` is determined based on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is `'>',` then `prev` is 1.
     - If `r` is `'<'`, then `prev` is also 1 (since the problem states "otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r` is '<'").

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

Given the above information:
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` will always be 1 regardless of the value of `r`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following string with the values substituted:
```plaintext
'? 2 2 1 1'
```

Output: **'? 2 2 1 1'**
