Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is 1, `v1` is 1**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 1) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now also 1, while `i`, `n`, and `v2` retain their original values.
