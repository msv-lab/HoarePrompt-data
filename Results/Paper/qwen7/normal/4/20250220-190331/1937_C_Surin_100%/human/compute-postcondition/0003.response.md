Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 1**.

Explanation: The variable `kp` retains its initial value of 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user, and it is specified that this input must be at least 1. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
