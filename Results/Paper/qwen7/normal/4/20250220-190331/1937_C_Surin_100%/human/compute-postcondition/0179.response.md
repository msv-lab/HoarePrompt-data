Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer which is greater than `n-1`.
- `v2` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is not explicitly defined, and there is no other information about it.
- `v2` is explicitly defined as 1.

Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state and there is no way to determine its value from the given information, we cannot provide a precise value for `v1`.

Therefore, the output will include `v1` as an undefined variable and the value of `v2` as 1.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 1 1**
