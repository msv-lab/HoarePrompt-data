Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is either an input string not equal to '>', or if `r` is '=', then `r2` is '<' and `prev` is 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The values of `r`, `r2`, and `prev` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is either an input string not equal to '>', or `r` is '=' in which case `r2` is '<' and `prev` is 1**.
