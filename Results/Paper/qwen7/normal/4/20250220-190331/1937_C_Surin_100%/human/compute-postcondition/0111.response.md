Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input from the user, `v2` is `i`**.

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only ensures that all previously written output buffers are flushed, meaning that any buffered output is immediately sent to the standard output device (like the console). This operation does not affect the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `v2`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
