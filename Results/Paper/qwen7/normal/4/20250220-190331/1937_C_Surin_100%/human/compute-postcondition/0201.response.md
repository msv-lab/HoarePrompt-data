Output State: **i is n, n is the new input integer which is greater than n-1, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time and `i` starts at `1`, it will reach `n-1` after `n-2` iterations. The last increment will make `i` equal to `n`. The variables `v2` and `v1` both end up being `n-1` because the loop does not change their values once they are set to `i` on the first iteration, and the condition `r == '<'` does not alter them further.
