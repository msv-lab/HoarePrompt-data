Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The variable `prev` will be set to `n-1` if any input resulted in `r` or `r2` being `'> '` or `'<'` respectively during the loop's execution. Otherwise, `prev` retains its previous value.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be one less than the original input integer `n`.
- The variable `n` must be at least 3.
- The variable `prev` will be updated based on the inputs received during the loop's execution, specifically if any input was `'> '` or `'<'`. If such inputs were given, `prev` will be set to `n-1`; otherwise, it will retain its previous value.
