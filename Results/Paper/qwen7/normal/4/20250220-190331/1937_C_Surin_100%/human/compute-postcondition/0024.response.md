Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `1, n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `kp` is 0
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is `i`
   - `v2` is `i`
   - `r` is unchanged and less than or equal to '<'

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is decreased to a value less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to a value less than `n` (e.g., `i = n - 1`).
   - `v1` and `v2` should also be adjusted to reflect the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `v1` is `n - 1`
- `v2` is `n - 1`

Since other variables (`kp`, `g`, `r`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`kp` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and the character `r` is unchanged, being less than or equal to '<'**
