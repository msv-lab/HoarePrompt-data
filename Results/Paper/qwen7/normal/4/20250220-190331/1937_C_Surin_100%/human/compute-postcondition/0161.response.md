Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It is a method used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output device (like the console). Since no variables are updated or affected by this line of code, the values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.
