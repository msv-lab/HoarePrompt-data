Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string from the user**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
