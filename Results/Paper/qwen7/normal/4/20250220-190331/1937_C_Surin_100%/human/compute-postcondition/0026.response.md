Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be at least 2
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n - 1`
- `v2` is `i`
- The character `r` is unchanged and is less than or equal to '<'

We need to determine the values of `v1` and `v2`:

- Since `v1` is `n - 1` and `n` is at least 2, `v1` must be 1 (the smallest possible value for `n - 1` when `n` is 2).
- `i` is `n - 1`, so if `n` is 2, then `i` is also 1.

Thus, `v1` is 1 and `v2` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Substituting the values of `v1` and `v2` into the print statement, we get:
```python
print(f'? 1 1 1 1')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 1 1 1**
