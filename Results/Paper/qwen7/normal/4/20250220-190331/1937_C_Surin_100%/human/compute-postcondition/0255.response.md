Output State: **i is n, n must be greater than or equal to 3, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, prev is 3.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending print statements are written to the console. However, this statement does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
