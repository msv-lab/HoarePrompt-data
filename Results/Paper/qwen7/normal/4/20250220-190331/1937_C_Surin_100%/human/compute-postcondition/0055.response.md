Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `r` can be either an input string not equal to '>', or if `r` is '=', then `r2` is '<' and `prev` is 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

We need to determine the values of `v1` and `prev`:

- Since `r` can either be an input string not equal to '>' or '=' (if it is '=', then `r2` is '<' and `prev` is 1), we do not have a specific value for `v1`. However, the print statement does not depend on `r2` or `prev` being 1 specifically; it just uses `prev` directly.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `prev` will be 1 if `r` is '='.

Since the exact value of `v1` is not specified and the print statement does not require it, we can only definitively state the value of `i` and `prev`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] 1**
