Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is either '>' or '=', `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<'**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, which means any buffered data in the standard output stream is written out immediately. Since no variables are modified or referenced by this line of code, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
