Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `kp` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is `i`
   - `r` is equal to '<'
   - `v2` is `i`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to some value within the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since `n` remains unchanged, `n` still needs to be greater than `1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `kp` remains `0`.
   - `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
   - `g` remains `0`.
   - `v1` will now be `i + 1`.
   - `r` remains equal to `<`.
   - `v2` will now be `i + 1`.

Based on these steps, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is equal to '<', and `v2` is `i + 1`**.
