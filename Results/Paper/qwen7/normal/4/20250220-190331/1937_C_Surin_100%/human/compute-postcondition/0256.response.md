Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` reaching `n`. The value of `n` must be at least 3. After the loop completes, `prev` will be set to `n-1`, `v1` will also be `n-1`, and `v2` will be `n-1`. The variable `prev` will retain its value based on the comparison results during the loop's execution. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed after each print statement inside the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `n` is at least 3, `prev` and `v1` both equal `n-1`, and `v2` equals `n-1`. The `prev` variable reflects the last comparison result within the loop.
