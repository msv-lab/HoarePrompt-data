Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input value from the user, `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 1 if `r` is '<'**.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, `n` must still be greater than 1, `r` now holds the value input by the user, and `prev` is set to 1 depending on whether `r` is '>' or '<'.
