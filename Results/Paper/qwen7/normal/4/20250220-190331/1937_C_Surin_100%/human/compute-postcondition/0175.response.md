Output State: **`g` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer which is greater than `n-1`, `r` is the input value from the last iteration, `prev` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `g`. No other variables are affected. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their previous states.
