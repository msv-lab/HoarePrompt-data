You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the total number of iterations the loop will execute, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is the first integer entered during the last iteration, and `b` is the second integer entered during the last iteration. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no changes are made. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'NO':**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`).
     - If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because cutting an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles will result in at least one dimension being even, which can be rearranged into a new rectangle.
   - The program also checks if either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`.
     - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because it does not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged into a 4x3 rectangle.

3. **Condition for Printing 'YES':**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'.
     - This is generally correct but needs to be refined to ensure all possible cases are covered.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so it prints 'NO' (correct).

- **Test Case 2:** \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is even, so it prints 'NO' (correct).

- **Test Case 3:** \(2 \times 6\)
  - One dimension is even, so it prints 'YES' (incorrect, should print 'YES' as explained in the problem statement).

- **Test Case 4:** \(3 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so it prints 'NO' (correct).

- **Test Case 5:** \(2 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are even, and neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a` holds, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 6:** \(2 \times 4\)
  - Both dimensions are even, and neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a` holds, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 7:** \(6 \times 3\)
  - Both dimensions are even, and neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a` holds, so it prints 'NO' (incorrect, should print 'YES' as explained in the problem statement).

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles cases where a new rectangle can be formed by checking only specific conditions. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
