Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered.
- `b` is the second integer entered.
- Neither `a` divided by 2 equals `b` nor `b` divided by 2 equals `a`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

The output of this print statement does not depend on the values of any other variables; it only prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
