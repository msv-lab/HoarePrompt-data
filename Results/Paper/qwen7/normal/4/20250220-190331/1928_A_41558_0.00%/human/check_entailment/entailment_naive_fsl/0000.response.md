Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. According to the problem, a 2x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles and reformed into another rectangle, but the program incorrectly prints 'YES' for such cases. 

For example, if we have a 2x1 rectangle, the program will check if `a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`, both of which are false, and then it will check if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, which is also false. However, the correct output should be 'NO' because a 2x1 rectangle cannot be cut and reformed into another rectangle. The program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
