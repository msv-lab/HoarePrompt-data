Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered.
- `b` is the second integer entered.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Either `a` divided by 2 equals `b` or `b` divided by 2 equals `a`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'NO'` without any changes because the string is explicitly provided within the print function.

Output: **'NO'**
