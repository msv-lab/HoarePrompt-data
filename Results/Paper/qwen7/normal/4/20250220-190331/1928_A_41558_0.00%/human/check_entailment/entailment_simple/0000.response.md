Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because neither can be evenly divided to form another rectangle.
   - It also checks if either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' because the division results in the same dimensions, which means no new rectangle can be formed (considering rotations).

3. **General Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic for determining whether a new rectangle can be formed is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly concludes that a new rectangle cannot be formed when `a` and `b` are both even and not equal. In reality, if both `a` and `b` are even, they can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can be reassembled into a different rectangle. For example, a `4x4` rectangle can be divided into four `2x2` rectangles, which can be reassembled into a `2x8` or `8x2` rectangle.

5. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the test case `2 4`, the program incorrectly prints 'NO'. However, `2x4` can be divided into two `2x2` rectangles, which can be reassembled into a `4x2` rectangle, thus forming a different rectangle.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
