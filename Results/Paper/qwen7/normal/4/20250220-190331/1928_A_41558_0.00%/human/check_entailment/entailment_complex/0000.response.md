Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for 'NO'**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO'. This is because cutting an odd-sized rectangle will result in two smaller odd-sized rectangles, and no further transformation can produce a different rectangle.
   - If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it also prints 'NO'. This is because cutting the rectangle in half results in two identical rectangles, and no further transformation can produce a different rectangle.

3. **Condition for 'YES'**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to obtain another rectangle through the described process.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are both odd or when cutting results in identical halves.
   - The program does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` is correct and aligns with the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
