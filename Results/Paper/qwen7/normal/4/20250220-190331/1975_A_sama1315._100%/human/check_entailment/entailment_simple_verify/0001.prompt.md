You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 in each iteration. The final value of `idx` will be 14 plus the value of `n` (which was determined in the third iteration) because `idx` is incremented by `n` at the end of each iteration. The value of `a` will be the last list of integers extracted from `data` based on the final value of `idx` and `n`. The `results` list will contain the results of applying `func_1(a)` to each list `a` processed during the loop's iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of func_1(a) for each iteration, separated by newlines




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)` sorts the array `a` in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Concatenating the Array with Itself**:
   - `concatenated_a = a + a` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `a` with itself.
   
3. **Checking Subarrays**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates through possible starting points of subarrays.
   - `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:` checks if the subarray from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` matches the sorted array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If no such subarray is found after the loop, it returns `'No'`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `input = sys.stdin.read` reads all input at once.
   - `data = input().split()` splits the input into a list of strings.
   
2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - `t = int(data[idx])` gets the number of test cases.
   - A loop processes each test case:
     - `n = int(data[idx])` gets the length of the array.
     - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the next `n` elements into an integer list.
     - `result = func_1(a)` calls `func_1` with the array `a`.
     - `results.append(result)` stores the result for the current test case.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it checks if the entire array `a` can be split and rearranged to match the sorted version of `a`. However, this does not guarantee that the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
- For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. Concatenating the array with itself and checking subarrays will not help in determining if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.

#### Function `func_2`
- The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
- However, it relies on `func_1` to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing, which, as discussed, is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: **False**
