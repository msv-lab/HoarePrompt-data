### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the current implementation. Let's break down the issues and verify why the provided solution is incorrect.

#### Issues with the Current Implementation:
1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array can be split and rearranged such that the original array matches a sorted version of itself when concatenated with itself. This is a flawed approach because it does not consider all possible ways to split the array and swap the parts.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The function `func_1` will not identify that this array cannot be made non-decreasing through the allowed operations. The function only checks if the entire array plus itself contains a subarray that is sorted, which is not sufficient.

2. **Lack of Comprehensive Split and Swap Checks:**
   - The function `func_1` does not explore all possible ways to split the array and swap the parts to check if the array can be made non-decreasing.
   - It only checks if the array itself plus a copy of itself contains a subarray that is sorted, which is not a comprehensive check for all possible splits and swaps.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to check all possible ways to split the array and see if any of those splits can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence.
- One effective way to do this is to iterate through all possible split points and check if the resulting arrays can be merged in a non-decreasing order.

#### Verification:
- The original assessment correctly points out that the current implementation is flawed and does not cover all necessary cases.
- The provided solution does not address the core issue of checking all possible splits and swaps.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. The current implementation only checks a subset of possible splits and swaps, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described.
