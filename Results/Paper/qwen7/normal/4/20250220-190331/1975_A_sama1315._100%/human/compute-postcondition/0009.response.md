Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n - 1` into a list of integers and assigns it to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `idx`, and `results` remain unchanged. The new list `a` contains integers from the specified slice of `data`.
