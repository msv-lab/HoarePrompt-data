Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)` sorts the array `a` in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Concatenating the Array with Itself**:
   - `concatenated_a = a + a` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `a` with itself.
   
3. **Checking Subarrays**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates through possible starting points of subarrays.
   - `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:` checks if the subarray from index `i` to `i + len(sorted_a)` matches the sorted array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If no such subarray is found after the loop, it returns `'No'`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `input = sys.stdin.read` reads all input at once.
   - `data = input().split()` splits the input into a list of strings.
   
2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - `t = int(data[idx])` gets the number of test cases.
   - A loop processes each test case:
     - `n = int(data[idx])` gets the length of the array.
     - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the next `n` elements into an integer list.
     - `result = func_1(a)` calls `func_1` with the array `a`.
     - `results.append(result)` stores the result for the current test case.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it checks if the entire array `a` can be split and rearranged to match the sorted version of `a`. However, this does not guarantee that the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
- For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. Concatenating the array with itself and checking subarrays will not help in determining if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.

#### Function `func_2`
- The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
- However, it relies on `func_1` to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing, which, as discussed, is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not accurately determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: **False**
