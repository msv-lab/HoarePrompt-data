Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_i` is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 10, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 9, so after executing `idx += 1`, `idx` becomes 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
