Output State: **`t` is an integer from the list `data` at index 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 2**.

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given that the initial value of `idx` was 1, after executing this line, `idx` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
