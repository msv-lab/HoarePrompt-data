### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The given solution uses a different approach by concatenating the array with itself and checking if a sorted version of the array is a substring of this concatenated array.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` can be rearranged to be non-decreasing by finding a substring in the concatenated array `a + a` that matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - This approach works because if a sorted version of the array is a substring of the concatenated array, it means there exists a way to split the array and swap parts to make it non-decreasing.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and processing each one individually.
   - The logic for reading and processing the input is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program calls `func_2`, which in turn processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program are consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles all edge cases as per the problem constraints (e.g., array lengths, values within specified ranges).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
