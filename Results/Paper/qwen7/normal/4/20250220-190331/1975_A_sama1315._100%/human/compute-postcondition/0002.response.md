Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `idx` being set to 0.
