Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be split and rearranged such that the original array matches a sorted version of itself when concatenated with itself. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible splits and swaps.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if this array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. The function `func_1` will not identify that this array cannot be made non-decreasing through the allowed operations.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible ways to split the array and see if any of those splits can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence. The current implementation only checks if the entire array plus itself contains a subarray that is sorted, which is not sufficient.
