Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index idx + n and of length n, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a)**.

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`, which is `int(data[11])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
