### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The key insight is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenated part is sorted, then the array can be sorted by performing the operation.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if there exists a way to split the array into two parts such that when the parts are swapped, the resulting array is sorted.
   - It works by sorting the array and then checking if any contiguous subarray of the doubled array (concatenated array) matches the sorted array.
   - If such a subarray is found, it means the original array can be sorted by swapping the parts.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies if the array can be sorted by swapping parts.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` appropriately.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem statement and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
