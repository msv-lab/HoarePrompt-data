Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `mi * 2` (either `k - mi * 2` or remains `k`), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
