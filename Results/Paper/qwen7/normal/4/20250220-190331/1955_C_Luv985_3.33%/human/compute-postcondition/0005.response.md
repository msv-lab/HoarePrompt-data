Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is a string from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. Therefore, `T` is still `T - 1`, `n` is now an integer derived from the original string input, and `k` is still a string from the input.
