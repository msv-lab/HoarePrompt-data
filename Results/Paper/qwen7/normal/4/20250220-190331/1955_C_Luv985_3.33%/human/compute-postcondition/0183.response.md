Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k` and reduced by `2 * mi`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 2`; `ans` is 2; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`; `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`; `a[l]` is 0; `a[r]` is 0.** 

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` equals 0, then the final values of the variables are as described in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes specified in the if part.
