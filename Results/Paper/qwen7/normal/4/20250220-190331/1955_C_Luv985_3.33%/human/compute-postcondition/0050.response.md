Output State: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 3, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
