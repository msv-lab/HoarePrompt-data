Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[1]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 2, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Otherwise, `k` is unchanged, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`.**
