Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`. The value of `mi - t - k // 2` is equal to 0**.
