Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` must be 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` is true or false, and `t` is `k % 2`.**
