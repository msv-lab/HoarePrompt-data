Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `mi` is updated to the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if the if part is executed, or `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1 if the if part is executed.
