Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer using the `map` function and `lambda` expression. The other variables `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
