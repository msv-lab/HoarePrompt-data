Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n-3`; `ans` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `a[r]` is equal to 0. If `a[r]` is equal to 0, `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to 4; otherwise, `l` remains 1 and `ans` remains 3.
