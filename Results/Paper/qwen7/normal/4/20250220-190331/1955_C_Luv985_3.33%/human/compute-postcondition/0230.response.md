Postcondition: `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either one less than its original value or remains greater than 1, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise it is reduced by `t = k % 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi` if `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1 if `l` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
