Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is a string; `k` is a string**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since the input is split, `n` and `k` are now strings, while `T` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer greater than 1.
