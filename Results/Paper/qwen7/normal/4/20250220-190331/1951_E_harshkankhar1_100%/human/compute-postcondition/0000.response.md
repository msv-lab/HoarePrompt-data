Output State: **s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state's length of the string `s` (denoted as `n`) remains unchanged and is now associated with the new value of `s`. The output state reflects these changes while keeping the precondition that `n` is the length of the string `s`.
