### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]
```
This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome. It works correctly by comparing the string with its reverse.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if (x == -1):
        print('NO')
        return
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False):
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif (x == 1 or x == n // 2):
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
2. **Finding Non-Matching Character**: It then looks for the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This is stored in `x`.
3. **Partition Check**: 
   - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO" indicating no valid partition.
   - If the substring `s[x+1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
   - If `x` is either 1 or `n//2`, it prints "NO" because these positions do not allow for a valid partition.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input `sinktheyacht`:
- The entire string is not a palindrome.
- The first non-matching character is `k` at index 4.
- The substring `s[5:]` is `theyacht`, which is not a palindrome.
- Therefore, the program should output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  sink theyacht
  ```

However, the current implementation only considers partitions of size 1 or 2. It does not explore partitions of size greater than 2, which can be valid in some cases.

#### Additional Test Case:
Consider the input `uwuowouwu`:
- The entire string is not a palindrome.
- The first non-matching character is `w` at index 3.
- The substring `s[4:]` is `owouwu`, which is not a palindrome.
- Therefore, the program should output:
  ```
  YES
  3
  uw uow ouwu
  ```

But the current implementation only considers partitions of size 1 or 2, so it will not find this valid partition.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible valid partitions. It only checks for partitions of size 1 or 2, missing cases where valid partitions of size greater than 2 exist.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it fails to consider all valid partitions of the string.
