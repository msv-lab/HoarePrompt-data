Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **YES**
