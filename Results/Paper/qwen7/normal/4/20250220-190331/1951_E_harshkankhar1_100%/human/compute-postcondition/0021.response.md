Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `x` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `x = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 3, to `x`. The conditions related to checking `s[3]` and `s[0]` are not relevant to this assignment since `x` is directly assigned the value of `i`. Therefore, the value of `x` becomes 3, while `i` and `n` retain their original values.
