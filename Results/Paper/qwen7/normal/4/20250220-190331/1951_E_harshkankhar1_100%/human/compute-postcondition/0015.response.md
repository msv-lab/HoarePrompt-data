Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of the input string `s`
   - If `s[1]` is not equal to `s[0]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**: We need to determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

5. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

6. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

7. **Value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of the string `s`, which does not change within the loop.

8. **Postcondition**: The postcondition remains the same unless the loop body changes it. Since the loop body is omitted, the postcondition based on the if statement remains as it was: if `s[1]` is not equal to `s[0]`, the program breaks out of the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the input string `s`**
