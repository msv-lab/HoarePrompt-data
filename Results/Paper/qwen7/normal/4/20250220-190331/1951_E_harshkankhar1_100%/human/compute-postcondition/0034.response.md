Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, meaning the loop or process that modified `i` has completed, and `i` now holds the value `n-1`.
- `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

When the `print` statement `print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])` is executed, it will print two parts of the string `s`:

1. `s[:x + 1]`: This is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the index `x`.
2. `s[x + 1:]`: This is the substring of `s` starting from the index after `x` until the end of the string.

Since `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, it implies that the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the conditions of the function `func_1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **s[:x + 1] [space] s[x + 1:]**
