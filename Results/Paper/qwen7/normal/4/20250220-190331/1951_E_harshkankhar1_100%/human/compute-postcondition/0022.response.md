Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `x` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
