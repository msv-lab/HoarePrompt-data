Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found, and `n` is the length of the input string `s`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then no change is made to `x`. Otherwise, if `x` is either 1 or half the length of the string `s`, then no change is made to `x`. In all other cases, `x` remains the index where the first non-matching character is found.
