### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem statement.

2. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_1(s)`: Checks if the string `s` is a palindrome.
     - This function correctly checks if `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
   - `func_2()`: Handles the logic for partitioning the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
     - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
       - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `1`, and the string `s` itself, which is correct.
       - If `s` is a palindrome, it proceeds to find the first non-matching character from the second position onwards.
         - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters match the first character), it prints "NO", which is correct because no valid partition can be formed.
         - If a non-matching character is found, it checks if the substring from the first non-matching character onwards is a palindrome.
           - If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the partition of the string.
           - If this substring is a palindrome, it further checks if the substring up to the first two characters is a palindrome.
             - If the substring up to the first two characters is a palindrome, it prints "NO".
             - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the partition of the string.

3. **Partition Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2()` is designed to handle different cases:
     - If the entire string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single non-palindromic substring.
     - If the entire string is a palindrome, it must be checked for a valid partition.
     - If a valid partition is found, it is printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly handles all the test cases as per the problem statement. It checks for the conditions specified and prints the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:

**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.
