Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:**
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function processes the input string `s` and determines if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
       - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character.
       - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO".
       - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
         - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.
         - If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" (this condition seems unnecessary and might be a mistake).
         - Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindromic Strings:**
   - The logic for checking if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings is flawed.
   - The function only checks for the first differing character and does not ensure that the remaining substring is non-palindromic.
   - For example, the string "sinktheyacht" is correctly identified as non-palindromic, but the function should handle more complex cases like "lllllllll" or "uwuowouwu".

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters or strings that are not easily split into non-palindromic parts.
   - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2()` uses `input()` which is not defined in the context of a typical Python script. It should use `sys.stdin.readline()` or similar method for handling input in a competitive programming environment.

### Conclusion:

The given program is not correct because it fails to properly handle the partitioning logic and edge cases. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
