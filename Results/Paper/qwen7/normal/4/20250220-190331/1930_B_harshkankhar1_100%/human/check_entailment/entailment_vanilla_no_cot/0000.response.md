Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not guarantee that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) will exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). 

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The generated permutation is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Here, \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 3\) divides \(p_4 = 1\), which violates the condition.

To solve this problem correctly, a different approach is needed. One possible correct approach is to generate a permutation where the parity (odd/even nature) of the indices ensures that no such pair exists. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    perm = []
    for i in range(n // 2):
        perm.extend([2 * i + 2, 2 * i + 1])
    if n % 2 == 1:
        perm.append(n)
    print(*perm)
```

This code generates a permutation where odd numbers come before even numbers, ensuring that no two adjacent pairs violate the divisibility condition.
