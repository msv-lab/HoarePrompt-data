Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the permutation.

2. **Querying for Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This step seems to be intended to find the index `i` such that `p_0 | p_i` is maximized.

3. **Finding Indices with Maximum XOR:**
   - It initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` as a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_m | p_i)` with `(p_mx | p_i)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and sets `mx` to `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`.
   - After finding potential candidates, it selects the first candidate `mx` and iterates through the list `v` to find the index `ans` such that `(p_ans | p_ans)` is greater than `(p_mx | p_mx)`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the solution.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - The logic for finding `ans1` is flawed. It compares `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`, but this doesn't necessarily maximize the OR value. Instead, it should compare different pairs of indices to find the maximum OR value.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Candidates:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR value among candidates is also flawed. It should compare pairs of indices from the list `v` to find the maximum XOR value, not just the OR value.

3. **Number of Queries:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries, which violates the problem constraints. The number of queries should be limited to 3n.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
