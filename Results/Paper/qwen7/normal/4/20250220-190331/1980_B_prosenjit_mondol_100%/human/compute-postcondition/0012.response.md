Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, and `a[k]` is still less than or equal to `x` after the if condition.
