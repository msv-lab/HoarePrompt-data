Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input integer minus 1, `f` is the first input integer minus 3, `k` is the first input integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, `a[k]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `f -= 1` decrements the value of `f` by 1. Initially, `f` was equal to the first input integer minus 2 (`f = n - 2`). After decrementing, `f` becomes the first input integer minus 3 (`f = n - 3`). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code.
