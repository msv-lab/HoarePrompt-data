Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer, and `k` is the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
