Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1.**

The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t`, `n`, and `f` retain their initial states, while `k` is now one less than its original value.
