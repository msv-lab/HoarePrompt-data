Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is sorted in descending order, the current value of `a[k]` is greater than the current value of `x`, where `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.
