Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the first input integer minus 2, `k` is the first input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is sorted in descending order, and `a[k]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `f` is decremented by 1, so `f` is now equal to the first input integer minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
