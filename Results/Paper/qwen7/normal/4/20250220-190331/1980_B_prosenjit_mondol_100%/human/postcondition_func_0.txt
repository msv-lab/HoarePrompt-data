The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), along with a list of \( n \) integers \( a_i \). It sorts the list \( a \) in descending order and compares the elements at indices \( f \) and \( k \). Depending on the comparison results, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but modifies and processes the input lists and integers as described.
