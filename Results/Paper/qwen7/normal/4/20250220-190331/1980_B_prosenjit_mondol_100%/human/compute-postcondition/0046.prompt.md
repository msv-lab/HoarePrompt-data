Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is sorted in descending order, and `a[k]` is compared to `x` (where `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`) as follows: if `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `a[k]` also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the first input integer minus 2, `k` is the first input integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, and `a[k]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input integer minus 1, `f` is the first input integer minus 3, `k` is the first input integer minus 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, and `a[k]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
