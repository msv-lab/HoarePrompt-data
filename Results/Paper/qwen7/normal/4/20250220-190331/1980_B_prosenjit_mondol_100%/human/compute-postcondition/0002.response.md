Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, and `k` is the third input integer.**

The code `f -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` and `n` retain their initial states, while `f` is updated to `f - 1`.
