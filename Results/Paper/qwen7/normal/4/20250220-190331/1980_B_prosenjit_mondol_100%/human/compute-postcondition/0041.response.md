Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first input integer minus 1.
- `f` is the first input integer minus 3.
- `k` is the first input integer minus 3.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the value of `a[f]`.
- `a[k]` remains unchanged.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **'NO'**
