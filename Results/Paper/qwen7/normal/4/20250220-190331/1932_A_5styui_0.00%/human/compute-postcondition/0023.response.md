Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `j` in the range from `0` to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `s` is an integer that increments by 1 if the character at index `j` of `b` is `'@'`.
   - The loop breaks if the character at index `j` is neither `'*'` nor `'@'` and the character at index `j + 1` is `'*'`.

4. **Consider the possible outcomes for the current iteration**:
   - If the character at index `j` is `'@'`, `s` is incremented by 1.
   - If the character at index `j` is neither `'*'` nor `'@'` and the character at index `j + 1` is `'*'`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, no changes occur to `s`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j < len(b)`, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `b` remains a non-empty string.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless the character at the current `j` is `'@'`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer, `j` is incremented by 1**.
