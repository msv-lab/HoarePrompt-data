Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, a is an input integer.**

The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The precondition regarding the second line of input being a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '@', and '*' also remains valid.
