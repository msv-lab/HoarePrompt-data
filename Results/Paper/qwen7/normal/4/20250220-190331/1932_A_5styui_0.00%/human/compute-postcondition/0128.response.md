Postcondition: `b` is a list of characters, `j` is 3. If the element at index 4 in list `b` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index 4 is not '*', the function continues with `s` incremented by 1 without any change to the list `b` or the value of `j`.
