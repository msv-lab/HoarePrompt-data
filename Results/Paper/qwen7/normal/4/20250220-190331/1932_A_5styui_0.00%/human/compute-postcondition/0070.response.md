Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `s` is either 1 or 0.
   - `i` is `i_final + 1`.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - Either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or if `b[j + 1]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(len(b)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented from its initial value (which is 0) until it reached a point where the condition `b[j + 1] == '*'` was met, causing a break, or it reached the end of the string `b`.

5. **Determining the New State:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j_final + 1` (where `j_final` is the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration).
   - If the loop did not break due to `b[j + 1] == '*'`, then `j` would be `len(b) - 1` at the end of the last iteration.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `len(b)` if the loop did not break due to the condition, or `j_final + 1` if it did break.

6. **Final State:**
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is now `j_final + 1`.

Given this analysis, the final state before the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is either 1 or 0, `i` is `i_final + 1`, `d` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `j_final + 1`**.
