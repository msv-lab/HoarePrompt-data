Postcondition: `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is equal to '@', we proceed as per the if part. If `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*', either from the if part or the else part (though there is no else part here), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j + 1]` is not '*', no further changes are made to `b`, `s`, or `j`.
