Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(len(b))`. The variables involved here are `j` and `len(b)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a list of characters.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `s` is incremented by 1 (though `s` is not mentioned in the loop head, it doesn't affect the loop continuation).

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `j < len(b)`.
   - Given `j` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `len(b)` must be greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(b)` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` is a list of characters, `j` is 4, and `len(b)` must be greater than 3**.
