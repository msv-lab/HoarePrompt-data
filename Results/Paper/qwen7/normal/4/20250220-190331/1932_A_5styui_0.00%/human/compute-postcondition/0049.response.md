Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(a)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `b` is a non-empty string (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `s` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes (this means `i` is already updated to its final value after the loop).
   - `d` and `a` remain unchanged (these variables are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged).

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < a` must be true. Since `i` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, we need to determine what `i` should be for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration).
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `b` is a non-empty string (unchanged).
- `s` is 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `d` and `a` remain unchanged.

Since `i` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_final + 1`.

State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `s` is 0, `i` is `i_final + 1`, `d` and `a` remain unchanged**
