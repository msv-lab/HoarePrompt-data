Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, the character at index `j` is not '@', and the character at index `j` is '*', and the condition `b[:]` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state are still valid.
