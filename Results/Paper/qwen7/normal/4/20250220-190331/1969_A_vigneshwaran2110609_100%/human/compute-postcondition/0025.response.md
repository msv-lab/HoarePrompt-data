Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 49.
   - `x` is 50 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't affect the loop execution).
   - `n` is within the range [2, 50].
   - `l` is a list of integers (not part of the loop head).
   - `flag` is either True or False based on the condition \( l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1 \) for all \( i \) from 0 to 49.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 49, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 50, but since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` would be 50 if `n` is greater than or equal to 50.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 49, it will become 50 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 50.
   - `n` must still be within the range [2, 50], but it can remain as it was in the previous iteration unless there is additional information suggesting otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 50.
- `n` must be within the range [2, 50].

State: **`i` is 50, `n` must be within the range [2, 50]**
