Output State: **`flag` is True, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, the value of `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains 0, `x` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, and the condition that `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1` (which simplifies to `l[0]` equals `1`) is still valid.
