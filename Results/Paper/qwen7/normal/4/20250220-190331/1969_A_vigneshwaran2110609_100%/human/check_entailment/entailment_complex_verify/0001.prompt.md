You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: i is 50, x is 50, n is within the range [2, 50], flag is True, and l is a list of integers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), followed by a list of n integers p (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). For each test case, it reads an additional integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ n) and checks if the condition l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1 holds for any i in the range 0 to x-1, where l is the list of integers. If the condition is met for any i, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return anything but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the list `l` to check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
     - If such a pair is found (`l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`), it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where more than one pair of friends are each other's best friends.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of multiple pairs of friends being each other's best friends and only prints `2` in such cases.

### Example Test Cases

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  5
  3 1 2 5 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Explanation:
  - Friend 4 and Friend 5 are each other's best friends, so inviting them would suffice.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Explanation:
  - No single pair of friends are each other's best friends. Inviting Friends 1, 2, and 3 ensures that Friends 1 and 2 come to the party.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Explanation:
  - Friend 1 and Friend 2 are each other's best friends, so inviting them would suffice.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Handling Multiple Pairs**:
   - The program only prints `2` if a single pair of friends are each other's best friends. However, it should print `2` even if there are multiple such pairs.
   - For example, in the test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with best friends `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program would incorrectly print `3` because it only checks the first pair.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program uses `flag` but does not properly handle the case where no pair is found.
   - The logic for printing `3` is not robust enough to cover all scenarios where more than one pair needs to be invited.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where multiple pairs of friends are each other's best friends and only prints `2` in such cases. Therefore, the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of invitations required.
