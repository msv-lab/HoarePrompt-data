Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to the sum of `n` and the floor division of `(n + i)` by `cnt` for each iteration from `i` starting at 2 up to `root + 1`, `root` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `cnt` is the square of `i` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), `n` and `k` remain as they were initially, `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for each `i` from 2 up to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `root` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n`.
