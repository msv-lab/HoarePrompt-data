Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers (their specific values are not given but are assumed to be unchanged).
- `ans` is calculated as \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{root+1} \left(\frac{n + i}{i \cdot i}\right)\), where `root` is at least 2.
- `i` is set to `root + 1` after the loop completes.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the sum of \(\frac{n + i}{i \cdot i}\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `root + 1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `root` are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output: **n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))**
