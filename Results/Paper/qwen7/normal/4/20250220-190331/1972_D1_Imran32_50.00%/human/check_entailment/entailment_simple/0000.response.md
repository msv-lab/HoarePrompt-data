Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation of `func_1()` does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply calculates \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{root+1} \frac{n+i}{i^2}\), which is unrelated to the problem statement.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem, one would need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair \((a, b)\).

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the current implementation does not follow the required logic to solve the problem, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
