Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\). It calculates and prints the value of \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\right)\), where \(\text{root}\) is defined as \(\sqrt{n} + 1\). The function reads \(n\) and \(k\) from input, although \(k\) is not used in the calculation. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated value for each test case.**
