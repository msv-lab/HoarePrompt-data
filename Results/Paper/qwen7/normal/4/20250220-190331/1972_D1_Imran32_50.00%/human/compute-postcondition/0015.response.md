Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers, n and m, under specific constraints. For each test case, it checks the values of n and m and returns appropriate results based on these values.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but handles a set of test cases internally, each containing two integers, n and m, and returns outputs based on the values of these integers within the given constraints.
