### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program. Let's break down the problems and verify them using the annotated code and the provided example.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The function should be called with `n` and `m` as arguments.
   - The variable `k` is used in the function definition but is not defined in the main loop where the function is called.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, it does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and calculations inside the function do not relate to the problem constraints.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code

1. **Function Call Issue**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called without any arguments in the main loop. This means the function will not receive the necessary parameters `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic Issue**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1()` calculates `ans` based on a formula involving square roots and divisions, which does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

#### Correct Approach

The original assessment suggests a corrected approach using nested loops to check all pairs \((a, b)\):

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This approach iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the original program and the need to correctly implement the logic, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
