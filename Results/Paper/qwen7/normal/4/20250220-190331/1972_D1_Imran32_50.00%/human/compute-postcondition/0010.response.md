The code `cnt = i * i` updates the value of `cnt` to be the square of `i`. Initially, `i` is set to `root + 1`, so `cnt` is updated to `(root + 1) * (root + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `2 * n`, `root` is at least 2, `cnt` is `(root + 1) * (root + 1)`, `i` is `root + 1`.**
