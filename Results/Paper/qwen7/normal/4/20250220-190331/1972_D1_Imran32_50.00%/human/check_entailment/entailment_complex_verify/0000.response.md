### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program:
```python
import math

"""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code provides a detailed state of the program at various points. Let's break down the logic of the function `func_1()`:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input. However, \(k\) is not used in the computation, so we can ignore it.
2. **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
3. **Loop**: A loop runs from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\). For each \(i\), it calculates \(cnt = i * i\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
4. **Output**: Finally, the value of `ans` is printed.

#### Analysis:
The logic in the function does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
- The function does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The function only considers pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) is fixed to a specific value derived from the loop.
- The function does not iterate over all possible values of \(b\) for each \(a\).

Given the example provided in the original assessment, let's verify the expected output for the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 2\):

- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- Checking the condition:
  - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), which is true.
  - \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), which is false.
  - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), which is false.
  - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\), which is true.

So, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\), making the total count 2.

However, the program outputs 4, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the problem description and produces incorrect results.

**Final: False**
