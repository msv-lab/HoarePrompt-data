Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, root + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i`, `root`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `ans` is equal to `n` plus \((n + i) // cnt\), where `cnt` is `i * i`.
   - `root` must be at least 2.
   - `cnt` is `i * i`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than `root + 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than or equal to `root + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `root` remains unchanged because it is determined by the initial conditions and does not change within the loop.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` was one less than `root + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `root`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `root` and `root` must remain at least 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n` plus \((n + i) // cnt\), `root` is at least 2, `cnt` is `i * i`, and `i` is `root`**.
