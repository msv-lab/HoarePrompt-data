Output State: **`stack` now contains the tuples from the previous iteration plus the new tuple (`node`, `x`).**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends the tuple `(node, x)` to the list `stack`. Since `node` is a node in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and `stack` initially contains the tuples from the previous iteration plus the new tuple (`node`, `x`), after appending, `stack` will contain all those tuples plus the newly added tuple `(node, x)`.
