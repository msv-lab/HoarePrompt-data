Output State: **`A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. This set is now part of the current state, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
