Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, sorts them, and then converts each integer in the sorted list to a string. The sorted list of strings is stored in the variable `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
