Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases (as specified by the value of `t`). After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t < 500, meaning no more test cases remain. For each test case, `n` will be an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` will be a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input for each respective test case.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` will be the number of integers provided, and `ar` will contain those integers sorted and converted to strings.
