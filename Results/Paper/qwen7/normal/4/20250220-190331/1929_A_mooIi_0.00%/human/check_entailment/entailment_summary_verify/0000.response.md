### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect and how the corrected version addresses the issue.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input, sorts the array, and then prints the sorted array as a string. This does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the provided program:
1. Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the length of the array \( n \).
   - Reads the array elements and converts them to a list.
   - Sorts the list.
   - Converts the sorted list to a string and prints it.

This approach does not compute the required beauty of the array. Sorting the array and printing it as a string does not maximize the beauty according to the problem's definition.

#### Corrected Program Analysis:
The corrected program addresses the issue by correctly calculating the maximum beauty of the array:
1. Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the length of the array \( n \).
   - Reads the array elements and converts them to a list.
   - Sorts the list.
   - Computes the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element.

Here is the corrected program again for clarity:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_beauty += ar[i] - ar[i-1]
        print(max_beauty)
```

This corrected program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements, which aligns with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the provided program has been correctly modified to solve the problem as intended.
