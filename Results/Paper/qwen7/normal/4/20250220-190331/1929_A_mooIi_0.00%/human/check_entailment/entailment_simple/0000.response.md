Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the function simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end of the array. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

Let's correct the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        ar.sort()
        
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n - 1):
            max_beauty += ar[i + 1] - ar[i]
        
        print(max_beauty)
```

With this corrected function, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, thus achieving the maximum possible beauty for the array.

Correctness: **False**
