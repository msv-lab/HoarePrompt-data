Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when you don't care about the value of the loop variable.
   - The expression `int(input())` is used as the loop condition.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` evaluates to a non-zero value. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the loop condition directly. The loop will run based on the user input.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide a non-zero integer input.
   - The value of `t` will change to the next integer input provided by the user.
   - The values of `n` and `ar` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and \(t\) is the next integer input provided by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input**.
