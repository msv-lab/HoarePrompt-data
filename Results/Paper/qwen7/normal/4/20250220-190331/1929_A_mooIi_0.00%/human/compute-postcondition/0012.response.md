Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts them to integers, sorts them, and then maps each integer to a string. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `ar` is updated to contain the sorted integers as strings.
