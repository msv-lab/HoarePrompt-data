Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't require any specific state adjustment.
   - However, the loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` provides a valid integer within its specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).

3. **Consider the Input Constraints:**
   - The value of `t` (which is the input to `int(input())`) must be between 1 and 500 inclusive.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input `t` such that it falls within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
