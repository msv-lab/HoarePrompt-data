Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic used in the program matches the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to check if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- Alice can paint each part with any of the \(m\) colors.
- Bob can repaint at most \(k\) parts to the same color.

### Key Conditions:
1. If \(n \leq k\), Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Hence, the answer should be 'NO'.
2. If \(n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil < k\), it means that even after Bob repaints \(k\) parts, there will still be at least one color with more than one part remaining. This is because \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil\) gives the minimum number of parts per color if the parts are distributed as evenly as possible among the \(m\) colors. If removing \(k\) parts still leaves at least one color with more than one part, Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Program Logic:
- The program correctly checks if \(n \leq k\). If true, it prints 'NO' which is correct.
- The program then checks if \(n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil < k\). If true, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case \(n \leq k\) correctly.
- The program uses \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil\) to ensure that even after Bob repaints \(k\) parts, there will still be at least one color with more than one part, which is the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program logic aligns perfectly with the problem requirements and correctly implements the conditions specified.

Correctness: **True**
