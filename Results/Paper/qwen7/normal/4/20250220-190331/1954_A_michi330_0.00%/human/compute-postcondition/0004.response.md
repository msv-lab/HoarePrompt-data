Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` is 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.
- The condition `(n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k)` is true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, as long as the condition specified is true.

Output: **'NO'**
