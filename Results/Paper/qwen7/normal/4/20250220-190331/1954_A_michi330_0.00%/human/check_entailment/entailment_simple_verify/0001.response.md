### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO'.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO'.
     3. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

4. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition is meant to check if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `ceil(n / m)` times.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'Yes'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the second condition. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` does not accurately reflect the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that even if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Alice might still be able to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 1`. Here, `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 2 < k`. According to the current logic, the program would print 'NO', but this is incorrect because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, and Bob cannot make all parts the same color with just one repaint.

### Corrected Condition:
To correctly determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, we need to check if the number of different colors `m` is greater than `k`. If `m > k`, then Alice can always paint the ribbon in a way that ensures Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly used the condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The corrected condition is `m > k`.

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
