Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` (the number of colors) is less than or equal to `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint). According to the problem description, if `m` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can always repaint the parts to match the color of the first part, making it impossible for Alice to prevent Bob from having all parts the same color. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results for such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 1 2
```
The program outputs "Yes", but according to the problem description, the correct output should be "No" because with only 1 color and Bob being able to repaint 2 parts, he can always make all parts the same color.
