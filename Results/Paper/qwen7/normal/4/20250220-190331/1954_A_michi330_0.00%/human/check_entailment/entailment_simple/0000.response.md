Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in the `func` function matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- Alice can paint each part with any of the `m` colors.
- Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
- If Alice can ensure that no matter which `k` parts Bob chooses, he cannot make all parts the same color, then the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it is "NO".

### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   
2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:` checks if Alice can force Bob to fail.
     - `n <= k`: If Bob can repaint all parts, then Alice loses.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition ensures that even if Bob repainted the minimum number of parts to make them the same color, Alice can still prevent this by ensuring there are enough distinct colors such that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

### Verification Against Examples:
1. **Case 1**: `1 1 1`
   - Alice has 1 part, and there is only 1 color. Bob can repaint 1 part. Since there is only 1 part, Bob can always make it the same color.
   - Expected Output: `NO`

2. **Case 2**: `5 1 1`
   - Alice has 5 parts, and there is only 1 color. Bob can repaint 1 part. Since there is only 1 color, Bob can always make all parts the same color.
   - Expected Output: `NO`

3. **Case 3**: `5 2 1`
   - Alice has 5 parts, 2 colors, and Bob can repaint 1 part. By painting the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, Bob cannot make all parts the same color because he can only change one part.
   - Expected Output: `YES`

4. **Case 4**: `5 2 2`
   - Alice has 5 parts, 2 colors, and Bob can repaint 2 parts. No matter how Alice paints, Bob can always make all parts the same color by choosing 2 parts.
   - Expected Output: `NO`

5. **Case 5**: `5 5 3`
   - Alice has 5 parts, 5 colors, and Bob can repaint 3 parts. By painting the ribbon as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, Bob cannot make all parts the same color because he can only change 3 parts.
   - Expected Output: `YES`

### Conclusion:
The logic in the given code correctly implements the conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` accurately reflect the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
