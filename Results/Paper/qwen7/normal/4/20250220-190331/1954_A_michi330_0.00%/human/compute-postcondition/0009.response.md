Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` remains 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split. If the condition (n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k) is true, then either `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds. Otherwise, `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.
