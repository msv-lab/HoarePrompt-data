Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `n` and `m` are integers, `k` is an integer.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them into `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integers obtained from the input.
