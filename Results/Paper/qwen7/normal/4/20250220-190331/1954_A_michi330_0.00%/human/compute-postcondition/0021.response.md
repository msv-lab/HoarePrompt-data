Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, itest equals the total number of iterations specified by t, n, m, and k are integers obtained from the input split for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold the initial value provided by the user, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The variable `itest` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is the value of `t`. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are obtained from the input split, and these values may vary depending on the inputs provided during each iteration. The conditions inside the loop do not change these input values; they only determine whether "Yes" or "No" is printed based on the given conditions.
