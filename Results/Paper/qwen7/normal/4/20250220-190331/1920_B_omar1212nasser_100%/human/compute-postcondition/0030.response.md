Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array elements). It calculates a series of values based on these parameters and the elements list, storing them in a list called `pos`. Each value in `pos` is computed as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the initial sum of the elements list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of the list, with `i` ranging from 1 to `removals`. Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in the `pos` list.**
