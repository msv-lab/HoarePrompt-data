Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in ascending order. Sorting helps in easily identifying the smallest elements which are removed or negated.

3. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements.
   - It maintains a list `pos` to store potential sums after different combinations of removals and negations.
   - It iteratively updates the sum `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `x` elements) and considers different scenarios where Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements.
   - The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum sum achievable under the given constraints.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly handles the problem statement and produces the expected results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
