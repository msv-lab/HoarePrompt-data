Output State: `i` is equal to `removals + 1`, `removals` is a positive integer, `s2` is updated to include the sum of `s2` and the elements removed from the end of `elements` for each iteration of the loop, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` is a list containing `removals` elements, each of which is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to the final value of `removals` (since the loop runs from 1 to `removals`), `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of `elements`, `pos` will contain `removals` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, and the other variables (`removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
