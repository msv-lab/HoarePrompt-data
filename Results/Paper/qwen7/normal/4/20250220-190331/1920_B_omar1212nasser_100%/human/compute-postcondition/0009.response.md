Postcondition: `i` is 2, `removals` must be a positive integer, and `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements` if the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`. If the condition is not met, the values of `i`, `removals`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
