Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements.**

The code initializes an empty list `pos`. This does not affect the values of `removals`, `negatives`, or `elements`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
