Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be at least 3, `s2` is decreased by `elements[-2]`, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the second last element of `elements` (since `i` is 2) from `s2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
