Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be a positive integer, `s2` is `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`, and the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**

Explanation: The code updates `s2` by adding the second last element of `elements` (i.e., `elements[-(negatives + i)]` where `i` is 2). Since `i` is 2, the index used to access the element in `elements` is `-(negatives + 2)`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
