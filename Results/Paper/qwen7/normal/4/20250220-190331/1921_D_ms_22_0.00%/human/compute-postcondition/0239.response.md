Output State: **`tp1` is 1, `ans` is still 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is now the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`; `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Since `tp1` was initially 0, after this line of code, `tp1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
