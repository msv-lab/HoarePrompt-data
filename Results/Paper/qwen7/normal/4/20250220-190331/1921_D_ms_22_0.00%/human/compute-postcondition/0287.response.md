Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is 1 more than its previous value; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Since `tp1` did not have an initial value mentioned, we assume it started from 0. Now, it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
