Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` will be empty, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not modify the existing variables `max_heap` or `t`, nor does it affect `ans` which is initialized to 0. Therefore, the only changes are the assignments of `n` and `m` with their respective input values, while `max_heap` remains empty and `t` is greater than -1.
