Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, t is a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. Within each test case, n and m are positive integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Additionally, a_i and b_i are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive for all i. The function returns results based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This describes the nature of the inputs and the processing scope without delving into the specifics of what the function does internally.
