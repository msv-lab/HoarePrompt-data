Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. The values of `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `max_heap` now contains the specified tuple.
