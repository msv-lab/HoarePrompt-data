Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is empty, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `ans` is 0, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `max_heap`, `t`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
