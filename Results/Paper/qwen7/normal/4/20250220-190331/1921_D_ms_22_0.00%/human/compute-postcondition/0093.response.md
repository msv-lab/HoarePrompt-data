The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `t > 0`. This means the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The variable `t` is the only variable in the loop head, so we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

Given the current state where `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop as described.**
