Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

This means that the `ans` variable has been updated by adding the value of `diff1` to its current value. All other variables retain their previous states.
