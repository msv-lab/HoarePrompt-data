Postcondition: `ans` is the sum of its original value (which is 0) and either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`. `diff1` remains the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` remains the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`. `tp2` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.
