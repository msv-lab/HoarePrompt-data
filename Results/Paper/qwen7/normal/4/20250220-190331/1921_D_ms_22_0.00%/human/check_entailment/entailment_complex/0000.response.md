Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases `t`, and then processing each test case individually. It reads `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, ensuring that the constraints are respected.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The program sorts the array `b` in ascending order and initializes a max heap to keep track of the maximum differences. This is a good approach to efficiently manage the differences between elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses the heap to push the maximum differences between each element of `a` and the smallest and largest elements of `b`. It then pops elements from the heap and adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure that the chosen elements from `b` are used optimally to maximize the total difference.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The program correctly handles the boundary conditions for `tp1` and `tp2`, ensuring that the elements from `b` are used in a way that maximizes the total difference.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the cumulative sum of the differences calculated during the loop.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given examples and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
