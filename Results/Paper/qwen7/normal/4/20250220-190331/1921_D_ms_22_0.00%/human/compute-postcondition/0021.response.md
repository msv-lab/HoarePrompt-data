Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` is true or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 > diff2` is false, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` and the first element in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` and the last element in list `b`, `diff1` is calculated as `abs(i - b[0])`.**

In this output state, the variable `diff1` is updated to be the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` (which is `i`) and the first element in list `b` (which is `b[0]`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
