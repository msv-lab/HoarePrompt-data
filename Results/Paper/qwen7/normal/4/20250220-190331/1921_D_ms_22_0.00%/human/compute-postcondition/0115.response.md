Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i_next - b[max_index])`, where `max_index` is the opposite index to `min_index`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff1` to `abs(i - b[0])`. The other variables (`ans`, `diff2`, `min_index`, `max_index`, `i_next`, and `max_heap`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
