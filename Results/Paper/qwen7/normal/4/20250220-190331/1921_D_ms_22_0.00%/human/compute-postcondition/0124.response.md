Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and the content of `b` remain unchanged. The updated `max_heap` contains the new tuple along with the previously existing tuple, if any.
