Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`**

Explanation: The variable `diff1` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the iterable `b`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged at 0. The iterable `b` is assumed to have at least one element, and `i` is a variable that exists but its specific value is not given, so it is represented as `i`.
