Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m`, `tp2` is equal to 0, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])` for each element `i` in list `a`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have been executed, `max_heap` will be empty since it gets popped in each iteration until it is exhausted. The variable `tp1` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time an element outside the range `[tp1, tp2]` is processed, while `tp2` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 or 2 based on the conditions inside the loop. The variable `ans` accumulates the cost of moving each element `i` in list `a` to its closest position in the sorted list `b` by adding the maximum of the absolute differences `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])` for each element `i` in `a`.
