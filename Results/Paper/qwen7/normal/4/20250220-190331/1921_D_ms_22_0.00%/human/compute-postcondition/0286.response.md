Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the negative value of `item[0]`. Since `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped, the value of `item[0]` is the highest value in the heap. After popping the item, the highest value item is no longer in the heap. Therefore, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
