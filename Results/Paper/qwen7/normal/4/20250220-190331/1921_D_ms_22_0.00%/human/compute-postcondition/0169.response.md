Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is 1 more than its original value; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1, and the other variables (`ans` and `max_heap`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, `tp1` is 1 more than its original value, and `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
