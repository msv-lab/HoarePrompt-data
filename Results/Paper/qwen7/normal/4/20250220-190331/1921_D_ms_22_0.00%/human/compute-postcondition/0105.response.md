Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b` (i.e., `b[m - 1]`). The values of `ans` and `diff1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
