Output State: **`tp1` is equal to `item[2] + 1`, `ans` is now `-item[0]`, `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1. Since `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` before the increment, `tp1` is now equal to `item[2] + 1`. The values of `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `item`, and the conditions related to list `b` remain unchanged.
