Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. Since `diff1` was originally greater than `diff2`, `diff1` is now replaced by `diff2` in the heap push operation because `diff2` is used in the comparison to decide which value to push. Thus, `diff1` is updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff2` is also updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])` due to the condition being met. The `max_heap` now contains the new tuple.
