Output State: `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(last_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(last_i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains a series of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(-diff, last_i, index)` with `index` being either 0 or `m - 1`, depending on which difference (`diff1` or `diff2`) was larger in the corresponding iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will still be 0 because it was never modified within the loop. The variables `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `last_i` and the first and last elements of list `b`, respectively. The `max_heap` will contain a collection of tuples, each representing the maximum difference encountered during the iterations along with the corresponding element from list `a` and its position relative to `b[0]` or `b[m - 1]`.
