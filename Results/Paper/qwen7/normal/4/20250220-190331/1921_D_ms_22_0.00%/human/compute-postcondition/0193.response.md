Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration.
- `max_heap` will be empty.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration of the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration of the loop)**
