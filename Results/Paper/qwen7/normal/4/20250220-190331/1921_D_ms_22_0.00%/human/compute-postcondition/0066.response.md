Postcondition: `tp1` and `tp2` are indices, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` and `m` are the first and second integers entered respectively, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `ans` is incremented by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on the condition. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 2.
