Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where the first element is either `-diff1` or `-diff2` depending on whether `diff1 > diff2` is true or false for each iteration, the second element is `i` (the current element from list `a`), and the third element is either `0` or `m - 1` (indicating which end of list `b` was compared with `i`), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `max_heap` will contain a tuple for each element in `a`. Each tuple in `max_heap` will have the negative of the absolute difference between the element from `a` and either the first or last element of `b`, the element from `a`, and a 0 or `m-1` indicating which end of `b` was used for comparison. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`) will retain their initial values as no changes were made to them within the loop.
