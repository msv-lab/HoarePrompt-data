Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`**.

In this case, the code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is the second element of the `item` tuple, assuming `item` is a tuple) and `b[tp1]` (where `tp1` is an index, but its value is not provided). Since `item` and `tp1` are not defined before this line, their values are unknown, and thus `diff1` is calculated based on these unknown values. The other variables remain unchanged.
