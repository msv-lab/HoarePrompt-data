Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**.

This output state reflects that the new variable `diff2` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
