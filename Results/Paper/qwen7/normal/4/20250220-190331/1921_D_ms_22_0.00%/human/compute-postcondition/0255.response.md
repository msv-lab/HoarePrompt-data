Output State: **`tp2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is -item[0], `diff1` and `diff2` will hold the absolute differences between the last processed element `i` and the first and last elements of list `b` respectively, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping, `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**

This means that the value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables (`ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `item`, and their conditions) remain unchanged from their initial states.
