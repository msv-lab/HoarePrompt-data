Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += diff2` adds the value of `diff2` to `ans`. Since `diff2` is defined as `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `ans` is updated to include this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
