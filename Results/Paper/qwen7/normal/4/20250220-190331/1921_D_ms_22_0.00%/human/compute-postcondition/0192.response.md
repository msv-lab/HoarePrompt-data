Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration, and `max_heap` will be empty.**

Explanation: 
- The loop continues to execute as long as there are items in `max_heap`.
- Each iteration of the loop pops an item from `max_heap` and adjusts `ans` based on the conditions provided.
- If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2-1]`, `ans` is increased by the appropriate difference (`diff1` or `diff2`).
- If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2-1]`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`.
- After processing each item, the relevant indices (`tp1` or `tp2`) are updated accordingly.
- Once `max_heap` is empty, the loop terminates, and `ans` contains the final accumulated value, reflecting all the adjustments made throughout the iterations.
