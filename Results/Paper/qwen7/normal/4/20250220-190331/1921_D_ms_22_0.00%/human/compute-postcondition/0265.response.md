Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by the value of `diff1`. All other variables retain their previous states, including `tp1` being incremented by 1, `diff1` being the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` not containing the item that was popped, `item` being the highest value item removed from `max_heap`, and `diff2` being the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.
