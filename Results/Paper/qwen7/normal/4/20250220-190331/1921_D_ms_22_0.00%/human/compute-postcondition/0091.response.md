Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is the sum of the differences calculated during each iteration of the loop as described.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `max_heap` contains no elements since it gets emptied out during the loop. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are set to their respective boundary values (`m - 1` and 0) and do not change further. The variable `ans` holds the cumulative sum of the differences calculated for each element in list `a` according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
