Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0.**

The code initializes `tp1` to 0. Since `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `max_heap` were already defined with their respective values or states, they remain unchanged.
