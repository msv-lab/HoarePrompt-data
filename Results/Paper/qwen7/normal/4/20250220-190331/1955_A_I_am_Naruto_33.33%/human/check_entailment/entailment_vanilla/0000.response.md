Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Single Yogurt Purchase**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `a`. This is correct because if Maxim needs to buy only one yogurt, he will pay `a` burles regardless of any promotions.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Purchase**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if Maxim buys all yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if Maxim takes advantage of the promotion as much as possible.
       - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts available.
       - `a * n % 2` accounts for the remaining single yogurt(s) that cannot form a pair.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program correctly compares `ans1` and `ans2` and prints the minimum value, which is the optimal cost for buying `n` yogurts.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `min(10, 14) = 9`

- **Example 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 18) = 15`

- **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 21) = 15`

- **Example 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Minimum cost: `min(20, 27) = 20`

All examples match the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
