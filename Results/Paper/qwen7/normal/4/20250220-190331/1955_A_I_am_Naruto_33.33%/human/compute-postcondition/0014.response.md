Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `b` is the third integer entered by the user.
- `n` is the new integer input from the user.
- `ans1` is defined and equals `a * n`.
- `ans2` is defined and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

We need to determine the value of `min(ans1, ans2)`.

Let's break it down:

1. `ans1 = a * n`: This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
2. `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: 
   - `b * n // 2` is the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
   - `a * n % 2` is the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

To find `min(ans1, ans2)`, we need to compare these two values:

- If `a * n` is less than or equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, then `min(ans1, ans2)` will be `a * n`.
- Otherwise, `min(ans1, ans2)` will be `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not specified, we can't give a specific numerical answer. However, we know the expressions for `ans1` and `ans2`.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of these two values.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
