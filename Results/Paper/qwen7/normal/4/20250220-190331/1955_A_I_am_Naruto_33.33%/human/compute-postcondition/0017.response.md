Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `ans1` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `a * n`, otherwise it is undefined, `ans2` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, otherwise it is undefined. If `n > 1`, `ans1` is set to `a * n` and `ans2` is set to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n <= 1`, `ans1` remains as defined if `n > 1` and `ans2` remains as defined if `n > 1`.**
