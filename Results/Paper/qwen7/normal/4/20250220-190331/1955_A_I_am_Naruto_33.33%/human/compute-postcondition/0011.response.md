The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. It does not define `ans1` or `ans2` unless `n > 1`. In that case, `ans1` would be the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` would be `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Since the code does not explicitly define `ans1` and `ans2` when `n <= 1`, these variables remain undefined. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are updated, but `t` remains unchanged as it was not used in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `ans1` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `a * n`, otherwise it is undefined, `ans2` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, otherwise it is undefined.**
