Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n > 1:
        ans1 = a * n
        ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
        print(min(ans1, ans2))
    else:
        print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, no new variables `ans1` and `ans2` are defined, and the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `ans1` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `a * n`, otherwise it is undefined, `ans2` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, otherwise it is undefined. If `n > 1`, `ans1` is set to `a * n` and `ans2` is set to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n <= 1`, `ans1` remains as defined if `n > 1` and `ans2` remains as defined if `n > 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user. If `n > 1`, then `ans1` is set to `a * n` and `ans2` is set to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is not greater than 1 (which is not possible given the precondition), `ans1` remains undefined and `ans2` remains undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
