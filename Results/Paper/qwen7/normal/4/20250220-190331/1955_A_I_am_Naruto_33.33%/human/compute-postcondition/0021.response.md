Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n > 1`, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans2` is assigned the value of `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans1` also remains unchanged as it was defined before the code snippet was executed.
