Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, but this value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user and is greater than 1.
- `a` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `b` is the third integer entered by the user.
- `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, so `ans1 = a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. This expression divides `b * n` by 2 and adds the remainder of `a * n` when divided by 2.
- The `print` statement outputs the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
