Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the scenario where \( n \) (the number of yogurts) is 1. In this case, it simply prints the price of one yogurt, which is \( a \).
- For \( n > 1 \), the program calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price.
  - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and the remaining single yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price.
- It then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for buying \( n \) yogurts.
- The logic for calculating `ans2` ensures that the program considers the best way to minimize the total cost by taking full advantage of the promotion when possible.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
