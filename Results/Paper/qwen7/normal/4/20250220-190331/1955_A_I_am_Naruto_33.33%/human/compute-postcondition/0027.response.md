Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, and a, and b indirectly through test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. It returns a result based on the values of n, a, and b for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`, where for each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `a, b` and produces a result based on these inputs. However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description focuses on the indirect acceptance and processing of `n`, `a`, and `b` through the test cases defined by `t`.
