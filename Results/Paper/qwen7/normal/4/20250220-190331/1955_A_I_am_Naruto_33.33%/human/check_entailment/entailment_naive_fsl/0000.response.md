Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than half the price of a single yogurt (a). In such cases, it would be more cost-effective to buy individual yogurts at price a rather than using the promotion. However, the program always considers the promotion option, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
4 5 10
```
- The program calculates `ans1` as `5 * 4 = 20`.
- It calculates `ans2` as `10 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 20`.

Since both calculations yield the same result, the program prints 20, which is correct in this specific case. However, for the input:
```
2
4 5 8
```
- The program calculates `ans1` as `5 * 4 = 20`.
- It calculates `ans2` as `8 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 16`.

The program should print 16, but it prints 20 because it always considers the promotion option, which is not optimal in this case.

To fix this, the program should check if the promotion price is beneficial before applying it. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

This version checks if the promotion price is less than the individual price before applying it, ensuring the minimum cost is always calculated correctly.
