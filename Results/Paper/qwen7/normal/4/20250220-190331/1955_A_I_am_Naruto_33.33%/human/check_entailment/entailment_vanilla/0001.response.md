Let's reason through the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Costs**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price `a`. This would be `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion (buying pairs at `b` and any remaining single yogurt at `a`). This would be `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Single Yogurt Case**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `a` since there's no option to use the promotion.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 1 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 2 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20`

### Verification with Provided Output:
- The output matches the expected results from the provided examples.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Yogurt (`n == 1`)**: The program correctly handles this case by printing `a`.
- **Even Number of Yogurts**: The program correctly uses the promotion for pairs.
- **Odd Number of Yogurts**: The program correctly accounts for the remaining single yogurt.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
