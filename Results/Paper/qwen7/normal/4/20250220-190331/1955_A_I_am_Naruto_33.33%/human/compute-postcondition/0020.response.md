Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n > 1`, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ans2` remains undefined as no operation was performed on it.
