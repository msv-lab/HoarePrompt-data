You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the last integer entered by the user for the nth iteration where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, and `ans1` and `ans2` are defined only if the corresponding `n > 1` during the iterations. If `n > 1`, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is not greater than 1, `ans1` and `ans2` remain undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times n / 2 + a \times n \% 2 \) (whichever is smaller), and prints the result. If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints \( a \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Costs**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price `a`. This would be `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if the yogurts are bought using the promotion (buying pairs at `b` and any remaining single yogurt at `a`). This would be `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Single Yogurt Case**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `a` since there's no option to use the promotion.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 1 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 2 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20`

### Verification with Provided Output:
- The output matches the expected results from the provided examples.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Yogurt (`n == 1`)**: The program correctly handles this case by printing `a`.
- **Even Number of Yogurts**: The program correctly uses the promotion for pairs.
- **Odd Number of Yogurts**: The program correctly accounts for the remaining single yogurt.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
