Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `p` where each element is the count of occurrences of each unique element in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
