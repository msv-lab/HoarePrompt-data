Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 500. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0.
