Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `p` is updated to a list of counts of unique elements in `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` creates a new list `p` where each element is the count of a unique element in the list `l`. This means that `p` now contains the frequency of each distinct number in `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and the original list `l` remain unchanged.
