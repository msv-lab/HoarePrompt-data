### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the number of cards left after performing operations.
   - Each operation allows us to choose `k` cards with the same number and replace them with `k-1` new cards.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of cards remaining after any number of such operations.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `l`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each unique card number using a list comprehension.
   - If the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - If the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, it means we can perform the operation to reduce the count of that number by `k-1`. This will continue until the count is less than `k`.
   - If the maximum count is less than `k`, no operation can be performed, and the number of cards remains `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all card numbers are unique, the maximum count will be 1, and no operation can be performed, so the result should be `n`.
   - If there is at least one card number with a count greater than or equal to `k`, the result should be `k - 1`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies whether an operation can be performed and calculates the minimum number of cards accordingly.
   - However, the solution does not handle the case where multiple card numbers have counts greater than or equal to `k`. It only considers the maximum count.

### Conclusion:

The given solution is almost correct but needs a small adjustment to handle the case where multiple card numbers have counts greater than or equal to `k`. The current implementation only checks the maximum count, which might miss some cases where the minimum number of cards can be reduced further.

### Corrected Solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        min_cards = n
        for count in p:
            if count >= k:
                min_cards = min(min_cards, (count // k) * (k - 1))
        print(min_cards)
```

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
