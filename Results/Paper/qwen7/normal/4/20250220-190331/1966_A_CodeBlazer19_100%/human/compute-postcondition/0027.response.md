Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of integers c (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value or result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing different values for t, n, k, and the list c. It processes these inputs to compute a result for each test case and returns that result.
