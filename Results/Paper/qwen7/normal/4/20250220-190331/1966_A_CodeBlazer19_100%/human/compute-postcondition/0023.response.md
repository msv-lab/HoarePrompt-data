Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`.

The `print(k - 1)` statement will subtract 1 from the value of `k` and then print the result.

Since the value of `k` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the input. Therefore, the output will be `k - 1`, where `k` is the input integer provided.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
