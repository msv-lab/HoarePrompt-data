Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`.

The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is described as an input integer.

Output: **n (where n is the input integer)**
