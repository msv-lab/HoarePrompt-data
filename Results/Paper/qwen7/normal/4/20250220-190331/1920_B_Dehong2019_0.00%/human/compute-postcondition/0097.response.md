Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is either `3` or `4`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, and `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, and `(i + 1) + x` is less than `n` if `i` is `3`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is either `3` or `4`, `ans1` is increased by `a[3]` or `a[4]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
