Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `x`, `i`, `ans1`, or `ans2`. It only assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `x`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain the same as before the execution of this line of code.
