Output State: `i` is equal to the value of `x`; `ans1` is decreased by the sum of each element in list `a` multiplied by 2 for each iteration up to `x`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the final value of `x`, indicating that the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The variable `ans1` will have been reduced by twice the value of each element in the list `a`, summed together and subtracted from the initial value of `ans1`. This reduction occurs for each index from 0 to `x-1` in the list `a`.
