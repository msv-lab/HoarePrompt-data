Output State: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x + 3`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (up to `k` times), the variable `i` will be set to `x + 3`. The value of `ans1` will have been updated based on the additions and subtractions performed within the loop, but only if the index `i + x` is still within the bounds of the list `a`. If `i + x` is not within the bounds, `ans1` will not be decreased. Finally, `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
