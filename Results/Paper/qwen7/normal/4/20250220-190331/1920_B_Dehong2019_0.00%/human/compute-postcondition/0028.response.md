Output State: **`ans1` is `ans1` plus `a[i]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `ans` remains the maximum value between `ans1` (after the increment) and `ans2`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
