Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`**

Explanation: Initially, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`. Then, the code further decreases `ans1` by `a[i] * 2`, where `i` is 1. So, `ans1` is effectively decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
