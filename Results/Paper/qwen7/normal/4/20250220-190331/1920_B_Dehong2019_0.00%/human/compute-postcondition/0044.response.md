Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans1` has been decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[i] * 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than 2.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `ans1` will be further modified by `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2` during this iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2`, `x` must be greater than 2**
