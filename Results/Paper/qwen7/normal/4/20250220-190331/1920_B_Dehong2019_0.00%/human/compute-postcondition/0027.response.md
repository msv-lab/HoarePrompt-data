Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `i` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` remains unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` was already within the range `[0, k-1]` before the loop ended.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range `[0, k-1]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as per the given information.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` is still the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
