Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. The values of `x`, `k`, `i`, `ans2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state. The updated value of `ans1` is explicitly stated as being decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`.
