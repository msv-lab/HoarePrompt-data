Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the condition that `x` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
