Postcondition: `ans1` is `ans1` plus `a[i]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to `ans1` minus `a[i + x]` times 2, keeping `ans` as the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the condition `i + x < n` is not met.
