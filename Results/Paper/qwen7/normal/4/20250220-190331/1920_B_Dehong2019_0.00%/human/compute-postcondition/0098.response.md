Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is either `3` or `4`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, and `(i + 1) + x` is less than `n` if `i` is `3`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. Since `i` is either `3` or `4`, and `(i + 1) + x` is less than `n` if `i` is `3`, this condition remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `x`, `i`, and `ans1` are updated accordingly, while the other conditions remain the same.
