Postcondition: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition `(i + 1) + x < n`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` which is now equal to `ans1`, and `(i + 1) + x` is less than `n` if `i` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes that `t` remains as `k + 1`, `x` stays less than or equal to `k`, `i` is determined by the condition `(i + 1) + x < n`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, where `ans1` is calculated as the original sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` (minus `2 * a[i + x]` in the if part). The condition `(i + 1) + x` being less than `n` when `i` is 2 is maintained.
