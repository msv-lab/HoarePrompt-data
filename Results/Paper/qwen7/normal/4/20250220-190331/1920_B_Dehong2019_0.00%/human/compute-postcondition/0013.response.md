Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`) remain in their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. It does not change the value of `ans1` itself, but it ensures that `ans2` now holds the same value as `ans1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them.
