Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(q)`.
   - This means the loop variable `i` is being initialized and incremented within the loop.
   - The loop will run for each value of `i` starting from 0 up to `q-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: 
   - When the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because `range(q)` generates values from 0 to `q-1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < q`.
   - Therefore, `q` must be a positive integer (since `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, `q` is guaranteed to be a positive integer).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - We also need to ensure that `q` is a positive integer.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `q`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0**
