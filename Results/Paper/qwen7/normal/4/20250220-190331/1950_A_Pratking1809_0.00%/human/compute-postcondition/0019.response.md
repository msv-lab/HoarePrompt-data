Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, and either the condition `a < b > c` holds true, or `b` is not greater than `c`; in the case where `a < b < c` is true, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
