Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in its implementation. The issue lies in the way the conditions are checked and printed. Specifically, the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are not mutually exclusive within the loop, which can lead to incorrect outputs. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions:**
   - The program checks for `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` independently within the same loop.
   - If both conditions are met for the same set of inputs, it will print both "STAIR" and "PEAK", which is incorrect.

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - For each set of inputs, only one of the conditions should be true.
   - If `a < b < c`, it should print "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it should print "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it should print "NONE".

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only one condition is checked at a time for each set of inputs, thus providing the correct output.
