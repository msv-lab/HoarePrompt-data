Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, and either the condition `a < b > c` holds true, or `b` is not greater than `c`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain the same, either `a < b > c` or `b` is not greater than `c`.
