Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is the result of bisect_left(v2, r) - 1, results is appended with 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
