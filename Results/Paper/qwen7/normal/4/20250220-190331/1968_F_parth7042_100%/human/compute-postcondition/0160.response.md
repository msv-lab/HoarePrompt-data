Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning the variable `q` has been exhausted. Therefore, `q` is now 0. The variable `index` has been incremented by a total of `2 * q` (since `index += 2` in each iteration). Given that the loop executed 3 times initially, `index` will have been incremented by 6 more times, making it `index + 6`.

The variable `results` contains a list of strings ('YES' or 'NO') corresponding to each iteration of the loop. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `results` will contain exactly `q` elements, which is the final value of `q` after the loop completes.

In summary, `q` is 0, `index` is `index + 6`, and `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' values corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
