Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is the result of bisect_left(v2, r) - 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` as the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The values of `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and the functions `bisect_left`, `pf`, and `mp` remain as they were before the code was executed. The value of `it2` is determined based on the values of `v2` and `r`, but since the exact values of `v2` and `r` are not specified, `it2` is expressed in terms of these values.
