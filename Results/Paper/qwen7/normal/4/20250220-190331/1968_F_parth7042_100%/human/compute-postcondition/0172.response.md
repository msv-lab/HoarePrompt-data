Output State: **`i` is 1; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `pf[i]` becomes `pf[0] ^ a[1]`. The values of `i` and `index` are updated as described, but no other changes occur to the variables.
