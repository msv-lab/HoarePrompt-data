t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, followed by n integers representing the array a, and then q pairs of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
