Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `q` is `q - 1`, and `results` now contains 'NO'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
