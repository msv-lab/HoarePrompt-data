Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is not yet defined, `x` is not yet defined, `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'NO' if the conditions for appending 'YES' are not met, otherwise it contains 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `l`. The values of `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain undefined because they depend on subsequent operations. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 3`. The value of `q` is decremented by 1. The condition for appending 'YES' to `results` is not checked yet, so `results` starts with 'NO'.
