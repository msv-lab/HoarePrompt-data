Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is now `['YES']`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially empty, after appending 'YES', it becomes `['YES']`. The values of `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
