Output State: **`i` is 2; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`; `mp[pf[1]]` includes the value 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` updates the dictionary `mp` such that the key `pf[i]` (which is `pf[1]` in this case) gets appended with the current value of `i` (which is 2). Initially, `i` was 1, `index` was increased by 1 (though `index` itself is not shown in the output), and `pf[1]` was calculated as `pf[0] ^ a[1]`. Now, `i` has been incremented to 2, and `pf[2]` will be calculated as `pf[1] ^ a[2]`. The dictionary `mp` now contains `mp[pf[1]]` which includes the value 1.
