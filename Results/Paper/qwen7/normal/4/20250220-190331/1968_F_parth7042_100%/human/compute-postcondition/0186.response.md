Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `l`. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated value of `l` and the unchanged condition of `q`.
