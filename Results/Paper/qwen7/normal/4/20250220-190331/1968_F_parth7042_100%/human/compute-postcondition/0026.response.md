Output State: **`a[1]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`, `index` is now `index_current + 3`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] XOR a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1` and appends `i_current + 1` to itself, `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- `a[1]` is already updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`.
- `index` is already updated to `index_current + 3`.
- `pf[1]` is already calculated as `pf[0] XOR a[1]`.
- `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1` and has appended `i_current + 1` to itself.
- The new line of code `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates `pf[i]` to the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is not defined previously, we assume `i` refers to the next index after `1`, which would be `2` (assuming `i` starts from `0`). So, `pf[2]` is updated to `pf[1] XOR a[2]`.
