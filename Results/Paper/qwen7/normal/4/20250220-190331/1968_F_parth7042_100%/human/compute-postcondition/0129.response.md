Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 4`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, all other variables (`r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `results`) remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
