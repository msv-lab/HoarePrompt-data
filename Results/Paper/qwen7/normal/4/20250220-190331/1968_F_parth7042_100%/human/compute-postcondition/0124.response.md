Postcondition: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the `results` list contains 'YES'; otherwise, the `results` list contains 'NO'.**
