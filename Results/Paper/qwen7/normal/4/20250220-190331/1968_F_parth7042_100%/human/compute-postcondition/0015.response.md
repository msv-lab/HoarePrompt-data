Output State: **`a[i]' is updated to int(data[index])'; index' is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `index` by 1. The value of `a[i]` is updated to `int(data[index])`, which remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `index` and the unchanged value of `a[i]`.
