Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the same as before (integer value of `data[index - 1]`), `x` is the same as before (`pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`), `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), and `q` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. Since `index` was previously `index + 2`, the new value of `index` is now `index + 1`. The values of `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged because they depend on the previous values of `data[index - 2]` and `data[index - 1]`, which have not been altered.
