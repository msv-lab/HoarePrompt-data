Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a[3]` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`.**

The code assigns the value of `int(data[index])` to `a[3]`. Since `i` is 3, the index in the list `a` is also 3. The conditions that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a[3]` and retains the initial conditions of `i` and `n`.
