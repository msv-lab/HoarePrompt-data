Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in the sorted list `v1` using binary search.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` performs a binary search on the list `v1` to find the index of the first occurrence of the value `l`. The variables `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `v1`, and `v2` retain their previous values, but `it1` is now assigned the result of the binary search.
