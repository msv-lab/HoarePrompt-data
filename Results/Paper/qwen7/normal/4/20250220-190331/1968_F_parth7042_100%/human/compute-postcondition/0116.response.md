Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` using binary search (bisect_left).**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` performs a binary search on the list `v1` to find the index of the first occurrence of the value `l`. Since `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]` and `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `it1` will be the index of `l` in the list `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
