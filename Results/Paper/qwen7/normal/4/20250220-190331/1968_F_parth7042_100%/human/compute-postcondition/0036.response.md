Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is ['YES'] and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `results` remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed. The `results` list remains unchanged and still contains 'YES'. We simply continue the loop without performing any further operations inside the loop body.
