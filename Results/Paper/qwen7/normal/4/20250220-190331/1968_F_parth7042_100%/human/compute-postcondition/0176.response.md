Output State: **`i` is 3; `index` is increased by 1; `a[3]` is equal to `data[index]` as an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `index` is incremented by 1, but the exact new value of `index` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still 3 and `a[3]` is still equal to `data[index]` as an integer.
