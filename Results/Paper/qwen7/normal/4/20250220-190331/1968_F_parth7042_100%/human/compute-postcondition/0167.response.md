Output State: **`q` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 8`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index - 6]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict with default factory `list`**.

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `mp` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `mp` can be used to store lists for any key that does not already exist in the dictionary. The values of `q`, `index`, `n`, `a`, and `pf` remain unchanged from their initial states.
