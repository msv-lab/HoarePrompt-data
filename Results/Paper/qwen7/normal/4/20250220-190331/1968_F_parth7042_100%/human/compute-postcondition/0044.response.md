Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is the result of bisect_left(v2, r) - 1, and the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` is true; `results` is now `['YES']`.**

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially empty, after appending 'YES', its value becomes `['YES']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
