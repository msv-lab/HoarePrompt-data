The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the values of `t`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are not affected by this input operation. The new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**
