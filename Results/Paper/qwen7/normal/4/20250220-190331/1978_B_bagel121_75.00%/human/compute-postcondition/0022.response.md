Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is assigned the value of `t - 2`. Since `t` is not used in any calculation or print statement, we can ignore this assignment for the purpose of determining the output.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. This means `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n * a)`.

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a**
