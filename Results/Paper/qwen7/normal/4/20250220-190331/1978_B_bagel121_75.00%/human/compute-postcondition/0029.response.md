The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function does not return a value directly but processes each test case to determine the total cost of buying `n` buns under the given pricing conditions. 

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three positive integers n, a, and b, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It calculates and returns the total cost for each test case.**
