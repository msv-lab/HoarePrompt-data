Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Regardless of whether the condition `a >= b` is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. If `a >= b` is true, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` and `p2` are calculated accordingly. If `a >= b` is false, the same calculations for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are performed.
