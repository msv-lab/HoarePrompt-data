Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The line `p2 = (n - k) * a` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, or `ans`. It only updates the value of `p2` to `(n - k) * a`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
