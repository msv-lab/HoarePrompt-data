Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`**.

The code calculates `ans` using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, where `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
