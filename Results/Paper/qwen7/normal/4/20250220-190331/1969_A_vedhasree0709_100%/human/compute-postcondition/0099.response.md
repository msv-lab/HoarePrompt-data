The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 2, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
