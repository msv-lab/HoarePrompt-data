Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
   - `j` is 1
   - `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`
   - `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1` after the increment.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n - 1` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3 so that `i <= n - 1` remains true when `i` is incremented.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`**
