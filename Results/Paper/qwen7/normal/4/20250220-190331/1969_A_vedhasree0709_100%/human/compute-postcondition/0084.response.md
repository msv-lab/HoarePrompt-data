Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `p` is `l[0]`
- `q` is `l[l[n] - 1]`
- The current value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(2)` executes.

Given that the value of `q` is explicitly stated to be `i + 1`, and since `i` is 0, it follows that `q` is 1. However, this information about `q` is not directly relevant to the `print(2)` statement, which simply prints the integer 2.

Therefore, the output of the `print(2)` statement is:

Output: **2**
