You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the number of test cases specified by the user. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `i` will be equal to `n`, `j` will be 1, `p` will be the last element of the list `l` (i.e., `l[n-1]`), and `q` will be the element at the index `p - 1` of list `l` (i.e., `l[l[n-1]-1]`). The program will print `2` during the first iteration that meets the condition `q == i + 1`, and it will print `3` for all other iterations, but since `j` is set to 1 after finding such a condition, no further iterations will occur.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three values: `t`, `n`, and `p`. It verifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is unique, within the range 1 to `n`, and not equal to its index. Based on these conditions, the function does not return any specific value but rather validates the input according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
