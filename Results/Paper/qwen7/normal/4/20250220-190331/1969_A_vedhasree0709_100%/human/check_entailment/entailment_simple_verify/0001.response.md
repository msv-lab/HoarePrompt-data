### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` representing the best friends.
   - It uses a while loop to check pairs of friends `(i, p[i])` to see if they can form a pair where both friends get invited and come to the party.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the provided program is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that if `q == i + 1`, then only 2 invitations are needed. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the case `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. Here, if we invite friends 4 and 5, both will come, but this is not the only possible solution. Another valid solution could be inviting friends 1, 2, and 3, which would also ensure at least 2 friends come.
   - The logic also fails to handle cases where no such pair exists but still requires at least 3 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come. For instance, in the case `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, no single pair can ensure at least 2 friends come, and sending invitations to 3 friends (e.g., 1, 2, and 3) is necessary.

4. **Examples from the Problem Statement:**
   - In the first example (`[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`), the correct answer should be `2` because friends 4 and 5 are best friends and both receiving invitations ensures they come.
   - In the second example (`[2, 3, 4, 1]`), the correct answer should be `3` because no single pair can ensure at least 2 friends come, and sending invitations to 3 friends (e.g., 1, 2, and 3) works.
   - In the third example (`[2, 1]`), the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 are best friends and both receiving invitations ensures they come.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed in all cases. It fails to handle scenarios where more than 2 friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.
