Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where no pair of friends can attend the party with just two invitations. For instance, in the third test case provided in the example (2 friends with best friends as 2 and 1 respectively), the program incorrectly prints 2 instead of 2, which is correct. However, in other cases where no two friends can attend with just two invitations, the program does not handle these scenarios properly.

A more robust solution would involve checking all possible pairs of friends and determining the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends attend. The current implementation only checks for a specific condition and does not cover all necessary cases.
