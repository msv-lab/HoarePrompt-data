Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[1]`**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` updates the value of `q`. Initially, `p` is equal to `l[2]`. Therefore, `q` is assigned the value of `l[p - 1]`, which is `l[l[2] - 1]`. Since `p` is `l[2]` and assuming `l` is an array or list, `p - 1` refers to the element at index `l[2] - 1`. Given the initial state, the output state reflects the updated value of `q` as `l[1]`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
