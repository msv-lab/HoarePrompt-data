Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the input values.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the input value provided by `int(input())`. The loop will run as long as the input value is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the initial state must include the condition that the input value is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.

Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for the loop to execute. The valid range for the input value is \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect this condition.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected based on the input value.
