Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[l[n] - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` updates the value of `q` to be the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. Given that `p` is initially `l[i]` and `i` is 0, `p` is `l[0]`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l[n]` will be the second element in the list `l`, so `q` becomes `l[l[n] - 1]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.
