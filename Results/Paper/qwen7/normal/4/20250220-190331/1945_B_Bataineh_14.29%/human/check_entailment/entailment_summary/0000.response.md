Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If true, it prints `2`. This part of the logic is correct because if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time would be 2, since the first and second installations would have launched their fireworks within the visibility period of `m` but not enough time has passed for a third launch.
3. **General Case Handling**: For the general case where `m` is greater than or equal to at least one of `a` or `b`, the program calculates the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at any given time using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\). This formula accounts for the fact that:
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at any time.
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of fireworks from the second installation visible at any time.
   - The `+2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks from both installations being visible at the same time.

Given the example provided in the execution summary, the program's logic matches the expected behavior for all test cases.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
