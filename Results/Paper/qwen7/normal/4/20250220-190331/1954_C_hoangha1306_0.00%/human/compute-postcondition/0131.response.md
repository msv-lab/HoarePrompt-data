Postcondition: `i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is updated based on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`: if true, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(x)`, otherwise it is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `max(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`, and `kq2` is updated accordingly: if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(y)`, otherwise it is `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.
