Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the string `y`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `kq2` is the string `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.**

In this output state, the variable `kq2` has been updated by concatenating the string representation of `x` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
