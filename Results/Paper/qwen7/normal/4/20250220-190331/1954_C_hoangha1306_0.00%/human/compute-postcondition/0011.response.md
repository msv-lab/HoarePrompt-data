Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, and the character at index 0 of `a` is equal to the character at index 0 of `b`; `kq1` is equal to `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` increments the index `i` by 1 (so `i` changes from 0 to 1), and concatenates the character at index `i-1` (which is index 0) of string `a` to the variable `kq1`. Given the initial conditions, `a[0]` is also equal to `b[0]`, but since no changes were made to `b`, its state remains unchanged.
