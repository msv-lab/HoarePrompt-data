Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]` followed by either the integer `x` (converted to a string) or the string representation of `y`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` with either the string representation of `a[2]` or `x` if `vt == 0`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` with the string representation of `y`.
