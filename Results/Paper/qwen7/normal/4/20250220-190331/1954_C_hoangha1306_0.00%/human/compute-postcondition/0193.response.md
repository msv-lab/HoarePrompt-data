Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `a[2]`. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**
