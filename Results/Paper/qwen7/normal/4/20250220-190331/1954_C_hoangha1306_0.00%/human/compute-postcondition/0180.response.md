Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string `a[2]`. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop or continues the current flow of the program without executing the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, all the variable states remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.
