Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of all characters from `a` where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of all characters from `b` where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, with the order of concatenation based on the maximum and minimum values of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` as determined by the loop's conditions. The variable `vt` remains 1 after the loop has executed, indicating that the first inequality was detected.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is less than or equal to `-1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings constructed based on the comparisons throughout all iterations, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either `0` or `1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be less than or equal to `-1` because the loop decrements `i` in each iteration until it reaches the beginning of the strings `a` and `b`. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` will contain characters derived from comparing corresponding characters of `a` and `b` as described in the loop body. Specifically, if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, both `kq1` and `kq2` append `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` appends the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `kq2` appends the maximum. Conversely, if `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` appends the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `kq2` appends the minimum. The variables `q`, `vt`, `x`, and `y` retain their last computed values within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `a` and `b` are the new input strings, `kq1` is the concatenation of `a[0]` through `a[len(a)-1]` where each character is the minimum of the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i-1])` and `int(b[i-1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i-1])` and `int(b[i-1])`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of `b[0]` through `b[len(a)-1]` where each character is the maximum of the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a`, indicating that all characters have been processed. The string `kq1` will contain the minimum value (as a character) of each pair of corresponding characters from strings `a` and `b`. The string `kq2` will contain the maximum value (as a character) of each pair of corresponding characters from strings `a` and `b`. The variable `vt` remains set to 1, indicating that the loop has entered the else block at least once.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
