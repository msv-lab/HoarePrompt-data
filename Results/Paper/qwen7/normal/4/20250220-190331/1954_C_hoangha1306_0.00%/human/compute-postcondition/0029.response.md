Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to its end.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` now contains this value as a string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
