Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `-1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `q` is `t`, `vt` is either `0` or `1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**, `a` is updated to the input string, `b` is updated to the input string.

Explanation: The line `kq1 = ''` initializes `kq1` as an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
