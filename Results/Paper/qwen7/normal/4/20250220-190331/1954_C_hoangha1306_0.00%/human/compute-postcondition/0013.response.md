Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, the character at index 0 of `a` is equal to the character at index 0 of `b`, `kq1` is equal to `a[0]`, `kq2` is `a[0] + a[1]` and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged.
