Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is either the concatenation of the string `a[0]` and the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, or the concatenation of the string `a[0]` and the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `kq2` is either the string `b[0]` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, or the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`.
