Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vt` is 0, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input integer, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. Depending on the value of `vt`:
- If `vt` equals 0, `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `str(y)` appended to its end, and `kq2` is a string containing either the value of `y` or `str(x)` appended to its end.
- If `vt` does not equal 0, `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to its end, and `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`.
- If `a[i] == b[i]` (where `i` is 1), `kq1` is equal to `a[0]`, and `kq2` is `a[0] + a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `y` depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`, and `kq2` is a string containing either `y` concatenated with itself or `x` appended to it depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`, or `kq1` is `str(y)` appended to its end and `kq2` is an empty string plus `str(x)` resulting in `str(x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, and `x` and `y` are integers. If `a[2]` equals `b[2]`, then `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[2]` to it, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is updated by concatenating either the string representation of `x` or the string representation of `y` to it, and `kq2` is updated by concatenating either the string representation of `y` or the string representation of `x` to it. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` becomes a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to it, and `kq2` becomes a string containing the value of `str(x)` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
