Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is a non-empty string
   - `b` is a string
   - `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`
   - `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`
   - `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `y` depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`
   - `kq2` is a string containing either `y` concatenated with itself or `x` appended to it depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`, or `kq1` is `str(y)` appended to its end and `kq2` is an empty string plus `str(x)` resulting in `str(x)`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(a)):`.
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2 (because `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `kq1`, `kq2`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `kq1`, and `kq2` will retain their values from the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `y` depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`, and `kq2` is a string containing either `y` concatenated with itself or `x` appended to it depending on the condition `a[1] > b[1]`, or `kq1` is `str(y)` appended to its end and `kq2` is an empty string plus `str(x)` resulting in `str(x)`**.
