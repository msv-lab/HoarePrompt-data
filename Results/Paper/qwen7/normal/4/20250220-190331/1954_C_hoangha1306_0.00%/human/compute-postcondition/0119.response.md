Postcondition: `i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` is updated by adding `a[i]` to its current value and `kq2` is updated by adding `a[i]` to its current value. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by concatenating the original `kq1` with the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; otherwise, `kq1` is updated by concatenating the original `kq1` with `str(y)`. `kq2` is updated by concatenating `str(x)` if `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, or `str(y)` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`.
