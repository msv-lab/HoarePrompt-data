Postcondition: `i` is 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is either the string `a[0]` or `b[0]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `kq2` is the string `b[0]` if `a[0] <= b[0]`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `x`.
