You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers in the sequence that are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, and the sum of p_i (i.e., p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4) is equal to the initial length of the sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, and `cnt` is the total sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a` that were processed during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a sequence defined by counts p_1, p_2, p_3, and p_4 of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, where each p_i is a non-negative integer and their sum equals the length of the sequence. The function returns a sequence of numbers based on these counts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
