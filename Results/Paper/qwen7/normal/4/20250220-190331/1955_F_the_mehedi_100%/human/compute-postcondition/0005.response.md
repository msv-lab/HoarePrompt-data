Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, with the current value of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` all having odd remainders when divided by 2, `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
