Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements must be odd.
- `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element `x` by 2 for every iteration, and it is now equal to the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a` that were processed during the loop's execution.

Since the exact elements of `a` are not specified beyond the first three being odd, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we know that `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element by 2.

Therefore, the output will be a description of `cnt` based on the given information.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all elements x in the list a)**
