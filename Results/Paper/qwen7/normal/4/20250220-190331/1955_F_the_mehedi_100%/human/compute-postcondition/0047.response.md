Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a sequence defined by counts p_1, p_2, p_3, and p_4 of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, where each p_i is a non-negative integer and their sum equals the length of the sequence. The function returns a sequence of numbers based on these counts.**
