Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
