Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the input value is greater than 0.
   - Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input value will always be a positive integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`, there is no need to adjust the state of `t` itself.
   - However, we need to ensure that the input value is correctly read and used in the loop.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that will be used in the `range()` function.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value used in the loop is greater than 0**.

Since the input value is read from the user, we cannot directly control its value through the initial state but need to ensure it is valid for the loop to execute.
