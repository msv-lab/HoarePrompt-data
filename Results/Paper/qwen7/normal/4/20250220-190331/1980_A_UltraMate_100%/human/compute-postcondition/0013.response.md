Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently 'A' and the loop iterates over each character in `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`. The next character after 'A' in 'ABCDEFG' is 'B'.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `p` to iterate over. Since `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and `i` is now 'B', the loop will continue.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `p`. The variable `ans` and the condition involving `hmp` and `m` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
