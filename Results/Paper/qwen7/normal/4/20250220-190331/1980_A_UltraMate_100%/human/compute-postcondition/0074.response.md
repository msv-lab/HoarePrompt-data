Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the character 'G'.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG'.
- `ans` is defined as `3 * m`.

Since the value of `m` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `ans` is three times the value of `m`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a value that is three times the value of `m`.

Output: **3 * m (where m is an unknown value)**
