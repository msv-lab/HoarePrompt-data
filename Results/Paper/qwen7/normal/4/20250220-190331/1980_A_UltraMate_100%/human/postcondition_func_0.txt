The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(t\), \(n\), and \(m\), and a string \(a\) of length \(n\) containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates the total sum of \(m - \text{count}(i)\) for all unique characters \(i\) in the string \(a\), where \(\text{count}(i)\) is the number of occurrences of character \(i\) in the string \(a\). If a character does not appear in the string \(a\), it adds \(m\) to the total sum. The final output is the cumulative sum of these calculations across all test cases.
