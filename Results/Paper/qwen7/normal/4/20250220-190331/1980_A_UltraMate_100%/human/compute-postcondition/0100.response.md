Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each key `i` in the dictionary `hmp`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the first key in `hmp`.
   - `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first key in `hmp`, the next key `i` will be the second key in `hmp`.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the value of `hmp[i]` for the current key `i`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `hmp[i]` or `m`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` for the next iteration. We only know that `ans` will be adjusted based on the same condition as before.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be the second key in `hmp`.
   - `ans` will remain unchanged unless the condition `hmp[i] < m` is met, but we cannot specify the exact value of `ans` without knowing the values of `hmp[i]` and `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
