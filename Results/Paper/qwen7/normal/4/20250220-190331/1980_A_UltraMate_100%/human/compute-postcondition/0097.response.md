Output State: **`i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m - hmp[i]`. The value of `i` remains the first key in the dictionary `hmp`, and the condition that `hmp[i]` is less than `m` still holds true.
