Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string from input, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**.

The code assigns the string `'ABCDEFG'` to the variable `p`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
