Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in hmp`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over the keys in the dictionary `hmp`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the second key in `hmp`.
   - `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Key**:
   - Since `i` was the second key in the previous iteration, the next key in the dictionary `hmp` would be the third key.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will now be set to the third key in `hmp`.
   - The value of `ans` will remain unchanged unless the condition `hmp[i] < m` is met during the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is the third key in `hmp`, and `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
