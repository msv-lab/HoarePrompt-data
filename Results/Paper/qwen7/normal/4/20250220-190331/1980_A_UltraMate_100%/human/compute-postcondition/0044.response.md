Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in p`.
   - The variables involved here are `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `i` is initially set to 'G'.
   - `p` is a string containing 'ABCDEFG'.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate over each character in `p`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is already set to 'G', it is ready for the first iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `p` contains at least one character to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `p` to ensure it contains at least one character. The initial value of `p` is 'ABCDEFG', which already satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
