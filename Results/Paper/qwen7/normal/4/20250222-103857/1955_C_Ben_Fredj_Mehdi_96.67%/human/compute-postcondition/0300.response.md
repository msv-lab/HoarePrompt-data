Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not needed since it is not printed.
- `t` is an input integer, but its value is not needed since it is not printed.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string, but the specific values of the list are not needed since it is not printed.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
