Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1, but its value is not needed since it is not printed.
- `t` is an input integer, but its value is not needed since it is not printed.
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, meaning if `a` was created from an input like "5 10", then `n` would be 5.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, so if `a` was created from an input like "5 10", then `k` would be 10.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.

The `print('2')` statement simply prints the string '2'.

Output: **2**
