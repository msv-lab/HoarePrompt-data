Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 3`, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0, and `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[g]` by 1 from its previous value of `int(a[g]) - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `a[g]` becomes `int(a[g]) - 3`. The values of `a[d]`, `i`, `k`, `g`, and `d` remain unchanged according to the conditions specified in the initial state unless they meet the specific conditions (i.e., `a[g]` equals 0 or `a[d]` equals 0), which are not met in this case.
