Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`**.

In this case, the code updates the value of `a[g]` by converting it to an integer and then subtracting 1 from it. Since the initial value of `a[g]` is not specified, we represent the new value of `a[g]` as `int(a[g]) - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
