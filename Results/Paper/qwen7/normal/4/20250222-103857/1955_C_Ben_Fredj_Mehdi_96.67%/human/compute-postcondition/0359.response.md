Postcondition: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`. If `n` equals 2 and `k` equals 1000000000 and `a` equals `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, the postcondition remains the same. If `n` equals 5 and `k` equals 2147483648, the postcondition remains the same. If `n` equals 20 and `k` equals 10000000000, the postcondition remains the same. If `k` equals 5999999999, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` equals 4294967295, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` equals the sum of list `a`, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` is less than the sum of list `a`, `z` is incremented by half of `k` (rounded down), `t` remains unchanged, and the elements at indices `g` and `d` in list `a` are decremented appropriately, with `k` remaining as the second element of `a` and being a positive integer. If none of the above conditions are met, the postcondition remains the same.
