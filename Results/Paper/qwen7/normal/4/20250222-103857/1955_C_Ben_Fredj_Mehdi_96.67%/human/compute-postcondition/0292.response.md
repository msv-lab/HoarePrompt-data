Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1. Since the exact value of `z` before incrementation is not specified, we only know that after incrementation, `z` becomes `z + 1`.
- `t` is an input integer. Its value is unknown but it is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string. The first element of `a` is `n`, and the second element of `a` is `k`.

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
