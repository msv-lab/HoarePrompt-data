Based on the initial state provided, the variables and their values are as follows:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not specified, it does not affect the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- The conditions for `n`, `k`, and the first element of `a` are such that they do not affect the value of `k` being 4294967295.

The print statement is:
```python
print('8')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'8'`.

Output: **8**
