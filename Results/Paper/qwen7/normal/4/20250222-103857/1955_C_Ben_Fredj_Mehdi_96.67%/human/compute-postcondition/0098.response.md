Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant for the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- The conditions state that either `n` is not equal to 2, or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1`, or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`.
- The current value of `k` is explicitly given as 3000000000.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('2')
```

Given this, the print statement will output the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
