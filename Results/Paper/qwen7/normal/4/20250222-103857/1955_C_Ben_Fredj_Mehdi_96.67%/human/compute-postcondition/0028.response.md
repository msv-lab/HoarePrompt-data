Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- Either `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1.
- The current value of `k` is 9999999999.

The print statement is:
```python
print('9')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'9'`.

Output: **9**
