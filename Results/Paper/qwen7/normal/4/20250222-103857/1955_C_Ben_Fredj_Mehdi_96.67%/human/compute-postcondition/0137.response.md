Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 2 plus 1, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k // 2 + 1`, `a[d]` is decremented by 1, `a[2]` is decremented by 1 if `a[2]` was not already 0, `a[d]` is now one less than its original value, and if `a[g]` is 0, `a[d]` is further decremented by 1.**
