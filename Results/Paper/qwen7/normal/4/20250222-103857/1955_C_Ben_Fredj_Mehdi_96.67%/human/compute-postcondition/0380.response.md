Postcondition: **`z` is incremented by 1. If `k` equals 1999999998, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` equals 1999999999, 2147483648, 5999999999, 4294967295, 199999999999999, 100000000000, 10000000000000, or the sum of list `a`, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` equals 2147483648 and `n` equals 2 or 5, or if `k` equals 10000000000 and `n` equals 20, or if `n` equals 101 and `k` equals 100000000000, `z` remains incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is less than the sum of list `a`, `z` is incremented by half of `k` (rounded down), `t` remains unchanged, and the elements at indices `g` and `d` in list `a` are decremented appropriately, with `k` remaining as the second element of `a` and being a positive integer.**
