Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1, but since `z` is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.
- `t` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement either.
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space. This means `n` is the integer value of the first part of the input string before the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. Therefore, `a` contains two elements: `n` and `k`.

The print statement is `print(len(a))`, which will print the length of the list `a`.

Since `a` contains two elements (`n` and `k`), the length of `a` is 2.

Output: **2**
