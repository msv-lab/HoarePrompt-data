### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of ship durabilities.
   - This part is handled correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function includes several `elif` conditions to handle specific edge cases where the value of `k` or the combination of `n` and `k` can be simplified. These conditions are designed to return immediate results without further computation. However, these edge cases are not comprehensive and do not cover all possible scenarios. For instance, the edge cases like `k == 1999999998` or `k == 1999999999` are hardcoded and may not generalize well for other large values of `k`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the function is to simulate the attacks on the ships. It alternates between attacking the first and last ship until `k` attacks are completed.
   - The function correctly handles the reduction of durability and checks when a ship sinks.
   - The use of a `try-except` block within the loop is unnecessary and could potentially hide errors. However, it does not significantly impact the correctness of the logic.

4. **Final Count**:
   - After the loop, the function counts the number of ships that have sunk (i.e., their durability is zero).
   - This part is handled correctly.

5. **Generalization**:
   - While the function works for the provided examples, the presence of numerous hardcoded edge cases makes it less general and harder to maintain. A more generalized approach would be preferable.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The core logic for simulating the attacks and counting the sunk ships is correct.
   - However, the numerous hardcoded edge cases might lead to incorrect behavior for other inputs not covered by these conditions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the numerous hardcoded edge cases. While the core logic is correct, the complexity and potential for maintenance issues make the function less robust.

**Final: False**
