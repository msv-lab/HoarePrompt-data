Postcondition: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, then nothing specific changes about `a`, `g`, `d`, and `k`. Otherwise, `a[g]` is set to -1, `a[d]` is set to -3, `g` is incremented by 2 compared to its initial value, `d` is decremented by 2 compared to its initial value, and `k` is an odd number.
