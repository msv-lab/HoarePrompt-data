Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant for the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to 5.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, and it is explicitly stated that `k` is equal to 2147483648.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, but this list is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
