Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it includes hardcoded values for certain inputs, which means it will fail for other inputs that do not match these hardcoded conditions. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 10
1 2 3
```

The program does not account for the general case where `k` is not one of the hardcoded values. It should dynamically calculate the number of ships sunk based on the value of `k` and the initial durabilities of the ships. The current implementation will not correctly handle this case and others where `k` is not one of the hardcoded values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
