Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The solution does not handle the logic for determining the minimum number of cards correctly. It checks for specific conditions but does not implement the core logic required to solve the problem.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is called but its purpose is unclear and it does not contribute to the solution. The function limits the frequency of each number to `k`, but this is not necessary for finding the minimum number of cards.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. For example, it incorrectly prints `n` when `k > n` and `k - 1` when `k == n`. This does not account for the possibility of merging different groups of cards.

4. **Missing Core Logic**: The solution lacks the necessary logic to merge groups of cards effectively. The problem requires merging groups of `k` identical cards into `k-1` new cards, and this needs to be done optimally.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to count the frequency of each card and then determine how many groups of `k` cards we can form. The minimum number of cards will be the sum of the remainders when the counts of each group are divided by `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This solution correctly counts the frequency of each card and then calculates the minimum number of cards by considering how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards are left over.
