Output State: **All values in `frequency_table` are capped at `k`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, every value in the `frequency_table` dictionary will be at most `k`. This is because for any key `num` in `arr`, if `frequency_table[num]` exceeds `k`, it is immediately set to `k`. Since the loop processes each element in `arr` exactly once, no value in `frequency_table` can exceed `k` after the loop completes.
