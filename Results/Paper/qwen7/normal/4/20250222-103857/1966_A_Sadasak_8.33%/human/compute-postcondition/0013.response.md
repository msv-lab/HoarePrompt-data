Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one less element than before; `frequency_table[num]` is increased by 1 unless it exceeds `k`, in which case it is set to `k`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary. If `num` was already present in `frequency_table`, its count is retrieved using `frequency_table.get(num, 0)`, incremented by 1, and then stored back in `frequency_table`. If `num` was not present, `get` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it. The condition that `arr` must contain at least one less element than before and the rule about `frequency_table[num]` being set to `k` if it exceeds `k` remains unchanged.
