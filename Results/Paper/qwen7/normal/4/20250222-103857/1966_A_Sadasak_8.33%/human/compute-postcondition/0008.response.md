Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in `arr` incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the number `num` found in the array `arr`. The `get` method retrieves the current count of `num` from the dictionary (defaulting to 0 if `num` is not already a key), increments it by 1, and then stores the new count back into the dictionary. The initial state of `arr` containing at least one element remains unchanged, but the value of `frequency_table[num]` is updated to reflect the new count of `num` in `arr`.
