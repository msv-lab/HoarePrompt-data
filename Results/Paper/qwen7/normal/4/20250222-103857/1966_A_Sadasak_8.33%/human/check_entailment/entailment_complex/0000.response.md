Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`. This part is correct.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no operations can be performed, and the minimum number of cards left is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because if `k` equals `n`, you can reduce the number of cards by `1` through one operation.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `arr` and ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`. This is done correctly using a dictionary to store the frequencies and adjusting them if they exceed `k`.
   - After adjusting the frequencies, the function returns the frequency table.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If `k` is in the values of the frequency table returned by `func_1`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is correct because if any card type's frequency is exactly `k`, you can perform an operation to reduce the number of cards by `1`.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if no card type's frequency is exactly `k`, you cannot perform any operations to reduce the number of cards below `n`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
