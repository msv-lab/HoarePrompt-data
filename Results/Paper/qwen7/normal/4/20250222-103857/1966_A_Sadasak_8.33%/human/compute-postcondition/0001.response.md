Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `num` is the variable that will take the value of each element in the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, but this is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`. Once `arr` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` in the first iteration, but its initial state before the loop starts is irrelevant since it will be assigned the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
