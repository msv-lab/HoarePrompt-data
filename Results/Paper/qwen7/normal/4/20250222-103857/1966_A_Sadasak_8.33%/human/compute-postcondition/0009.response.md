Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `frequency_table[num] = k` updates the frequency of `num` in `frequency_table` to `k`. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element and that `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in `arr` incremented by 1 remains valid, but now the frequency is explicitly set to `k`.
