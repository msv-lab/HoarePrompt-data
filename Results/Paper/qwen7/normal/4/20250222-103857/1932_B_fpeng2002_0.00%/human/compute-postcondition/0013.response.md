Output State: `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the value of `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`. This means that `start_year` will be adjusted based on the last element in the `nums` list after processing each element in the list exactly once. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) retain their initial or previously determined states as they are not affected by the loop.
