Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `x in range(0, len(nums))`. For the loop to continue, `x` must be less than `len(nums)`.
   - Currently, `x` is 1. To proceed to the next iteration, `x` should be incremented to 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `nums`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` needs to be set to 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `num_tests` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `start_year` remains unchanged.
   - `x` is now 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`**.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`**
