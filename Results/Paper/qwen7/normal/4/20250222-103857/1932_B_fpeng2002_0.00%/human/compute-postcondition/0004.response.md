Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged.
