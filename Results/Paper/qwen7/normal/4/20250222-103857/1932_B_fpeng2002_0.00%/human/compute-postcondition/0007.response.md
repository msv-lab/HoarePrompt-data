Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` based on the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `start_year` is initially 0 and `x` is 0, the formula simplifies to `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which further simplifies to `(1 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since `nums[0]` is an integer, `1 // nums[0]` results in 0 if `nums[0]` is greater than 1, and 1 if `nums[0]` is 1. Therefore, `start_year` becomes `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 1, or 2 if `nums[0]` is 1. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
