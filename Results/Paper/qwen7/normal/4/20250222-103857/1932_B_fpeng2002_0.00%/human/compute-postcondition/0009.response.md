Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. Since `x` is 1, the code uses `nums[1]` in the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
