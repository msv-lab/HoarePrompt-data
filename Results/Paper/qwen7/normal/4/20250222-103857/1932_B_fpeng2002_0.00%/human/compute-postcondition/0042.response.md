To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `start_year`.

Given:
- `x` is 0.
- `start_year` is calculated as `((((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`.
- `num_tests` remains unchanged.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `n` is an input integer.

The key part here is the calculation of `start_year`. Since the exact values of `nums` and `start_year` are not provided, we need to focus on how `start_year` is derived from the formula. The formula involves a series of operations with the elements of `nums`.

Let's assume the `nums` list and `start_year` are such that the formula can be evaluated step-by-step:

1. Start with `start_year` (let's call this initial `start_year_val`).
2. Apply the formula step-by-step:
   - `start_year_val = ((((start_year_val + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`

Since the exact values are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value for `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `start_year` will be a result of the operations described.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the formula `((((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`)**
