Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` is 1
- `start_year` is `((((start_year + 1) // nums[1]) + 1) * nums[1])`

### Loop Statement
```
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `x < len(nums)`.
2. **Current Value of `x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented to 2 (since the loop starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time).

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `x`**: It needs to be set to 2 for the next iteration.
- **Variable `start_year`**: The value of `start_year` does not change within the loop body, so it remains the same as calculated in the previous iteration.

### Final State
- `x` is 2
- `start_year` is `((((start_year + 1) // nums[1]) + 1) * nums[1])`

### Answer
State: **`x` is 2, `start_year` is `((((start_year + 1) // nums[1]) + 1) * nums[1])`**
