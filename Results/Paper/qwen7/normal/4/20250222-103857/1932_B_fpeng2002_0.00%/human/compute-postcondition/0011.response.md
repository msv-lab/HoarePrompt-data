Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 2, the formula becomes `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
