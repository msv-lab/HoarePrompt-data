Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is updated to the value of `n` from the input split, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, and `last_row` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `first_row = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `first_row`. Since `a` is an empty list, both `first_row` and `last_row` are set to empty strings. All other variables retain their previous values.
