Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `first_row` is the last character of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the only element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in list `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` contains only one element, `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that element. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
