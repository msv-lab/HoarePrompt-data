Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed plus 1, `i` is `n`, `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `a` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together, `n` is updated to the value of `n, m = map(int, input().split())`.**

This means that the values of `t`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `m` are now updated to the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
