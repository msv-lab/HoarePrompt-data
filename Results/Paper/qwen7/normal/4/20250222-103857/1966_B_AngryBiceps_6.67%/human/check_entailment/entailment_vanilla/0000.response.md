### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations. An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the grid itself.
   - It then creates two strings: `first_row` (the first row of the grid) and `last_row` (the last row of the grid).
   - The function checks two conditions:
     - If the first row is uniform but different from the last row.
     - If the first row and the last row are uniform but different from each other.
   
3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The condition `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]` checks if the first row is uniform (all elements are the same) but different from the last row. This would mean it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows are different.
   - The condition `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row` checks if both the first and last rows are uniform but different from each other. This also means it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows are different.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the function prints "YES", indicating it's possible to make all squares the same color.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles cases where the grid is already uniform.
   - It correctly identifies cases where making the entire grid uniform is impossible due to differences in the first and last rows or columns.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given solution is sound and correctly identifies when it's possible to make all squares the same color.
   - The conditions checked ensure that if there is any difference between the first and last rows or columns, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the provided problem description.
