Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original element and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new input to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contained one element, after appending, it now contains two elements. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
