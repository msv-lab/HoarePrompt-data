Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` plus the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements. After appending, `a` now contains three elements. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
