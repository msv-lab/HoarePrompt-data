Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is updated to the value of `n` from the input split, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `a`. This means that all the previously constructed lists (`a`, `first_row`, `last_row`) are now reset to their initial states. The values of `t`, `m`, `i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged from their previous states.
