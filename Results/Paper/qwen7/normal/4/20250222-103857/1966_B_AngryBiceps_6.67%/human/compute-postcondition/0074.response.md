Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original element plus the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original last character and the first character of the last element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the second element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` updates `first_row` by concatenating its current value with the first character of the last element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
