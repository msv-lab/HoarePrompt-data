Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program checks only the first row and the last row for uniformity and does not consider the entire grid. This means it fails to handle cases where the grid can be made uniform through the allowed operations but the first and last rows are not uniform.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
2 3
BBW
WBB
```

In this case, it is possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners, which would result in a grid of all 'B's. However, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because the first and last rows are not uniform.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check if it's possible to make all rows or all columns uniform, as any uniform row or column can be extended to cover the entire grid with the given operations.
