Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is \(i_{prev} + 1\), `n` is \(n_{prev} + 1\), `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the input string from the user, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the latest input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of its previous value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is updated to include the last element of the last string in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the latest input string to the list `a`. Since `a` previously contained two elements, after appending the new input string, `a` now contains three elements. The first element remains the same as the previous first element, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the latest input string. The values of `t`, `m`, `i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged except for their definitions which now include the new input string.
