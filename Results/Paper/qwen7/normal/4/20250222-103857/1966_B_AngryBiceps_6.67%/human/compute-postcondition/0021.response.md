Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.
- `i` is \(n-1\).
- `m` is an integer obtained from the second input.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input provided in each iteration.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is the last character of each element in the list `a` concatenated together.
- The first element of `a` contains characters that are all the same.
- The first element of `a` is different from the last element of `a`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'` without any additional variables or objects being evaluated or concatenated.

Output: **NO**
