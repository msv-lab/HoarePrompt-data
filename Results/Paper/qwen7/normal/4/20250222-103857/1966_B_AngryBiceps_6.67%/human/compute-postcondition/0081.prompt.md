Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is updated to the value of `n` from the input split, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is equal to an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `first_row` is the last character of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the only element in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original element plus the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original last character and the first character of the last element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the second element in list `a`, `last_row` is updated by adding the last character of the last element in list `a` to itself.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements plus the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of its original last character and the first character of the last element in list `a`, `last_row` is equal to the last character of the second element in list `a` followed by itself, `last_row` is updated by adding the last character of the last element in list `a` to itself.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
