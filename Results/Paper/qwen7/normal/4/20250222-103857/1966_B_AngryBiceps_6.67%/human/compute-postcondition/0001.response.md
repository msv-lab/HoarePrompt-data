Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input**.

The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the initial state only specifies the range of `t`, and no information about `t` itself is used in the code, `t` remains unchanged. The input is split into `n` and `m`, which are assigned to the respective variables.
