Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing the digits of `func_1(n)`, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `x` with a single element `0`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
