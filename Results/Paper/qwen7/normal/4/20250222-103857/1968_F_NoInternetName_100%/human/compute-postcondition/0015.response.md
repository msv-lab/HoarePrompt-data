Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1, 2, ...], 1: [1, 2, 4, ...], 2: [2, 4, ...], ...}`, `x` is a list containing all the elements generated by the loop, which starts from `[0]` and appends each new value as the result of `x[-1] ^ i` where `i` is the current digit from the list `a`. The length of `x` will be equal to the sum of the digits in `a` plus one.

In this final state, the dictionary `inds` will contain keys that are the unique values in the list `x` (excluding the initial 0), and the corresponding values will be lists of indices where these values appear in `x`. The list `x` will include all intermediate results generated during the loop's execution, starting from 0 and ending with the last computed value, with each new value being the result of a bitwise XOR operation between the previous value in `x` and the current digit from the list `a`.
