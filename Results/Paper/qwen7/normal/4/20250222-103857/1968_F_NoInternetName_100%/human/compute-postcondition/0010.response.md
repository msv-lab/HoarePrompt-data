Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [1, 2]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least one less digit of `func_1(n)` than before, `x` is a list `[0, 1, 1, 2]`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `inds[0]` contains `[0, 1]`.
- The code appends the length of `x` minus 1 (which is 3 - 1 = 2) to `inds[x[-1]]`. Since `x[-1]` is `1`, `inds[1]` is updated to include `2`.
- After the operation, `inds` becomes `{0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [1, 2]}`.
- The length of `x` increases by 1, so `x` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 2]`.
