Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists

The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values need to be determined, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **Yes**
