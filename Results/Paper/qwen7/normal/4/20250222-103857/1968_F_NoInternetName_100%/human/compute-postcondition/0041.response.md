Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `q` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, but the function `func_1` and its input are not specified.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, similar to `l`.
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists. However, the exact structure of `inds` and `x` is not provided.

Given these details, the only thing that is explicitly stated and will be printed is the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
