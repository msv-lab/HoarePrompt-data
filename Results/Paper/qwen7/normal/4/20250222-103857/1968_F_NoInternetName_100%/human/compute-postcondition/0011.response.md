Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` contains at least one less digit of `func_1(n)` than before.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `inds`: This dictionary does not change within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
   - `n`: This variable does not change within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
   - `q`: This variable does not change within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
   - `a`: Since the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `a`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `a` had at least one less element, `a` now has at least two less elements than before.
   - `x`: This list does not change within the loop, so it remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the reduction in the length of `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [1, 2]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least two less digits of `func_1(n)` than before, `x` is a list `[0, 1, 1, 2]`**
