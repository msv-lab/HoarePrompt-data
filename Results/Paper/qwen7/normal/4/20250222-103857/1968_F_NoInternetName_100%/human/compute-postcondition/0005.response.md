Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the source of `i`**: The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, `i` takes on each value from the list `a` during each iteration.

3. **Initial state of `a`**: The initial state of `a` is given as a list containing the digits of `func_1(n)`.

4. **Initial state of other variables**:
   - `inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0]}`.
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\) (inclusive).
   - `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\) (inclusive).
   - `x` is a list containing the single element 0.

5. **Loop condition**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. Since `a` is initialized with the digits of `func_1(n)`, and `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer, `a` will always contain at least one digit.

6. **Adjusting the state**:
   - The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `i`, which comes from the list `a`.
   - We need to ensure that `a` is not empty, but since `a` is initialized with the digits of `func_1(n)`, it will always have at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the list `a` ensuring it contains at least one element, which it inherently does based on the initialization.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0]}`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list containing at least one digit of `func_1(n)`, `x` is a list containing the single element 0**
