### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a space-separated sequence of integers from input and converts them using the provided `cast` function.
   - It returns a map object which is then converted to a list when used in other functions.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the leftmost index where the predicate is true.
   - If the predicate is true at the leftmost index, it returns that index; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function simply calls `func_2` and returns its result.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function calls `func_2` and adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`; otherwise, it returns `None`.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function processes the main logic of the problem.
   - It constructs a prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.
   - For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR values at the boundaries of the subarray are equal.
   - If they are not equal, it uses binary search to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary `inds` to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Analysis:

- The overall logic of the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It constructs the prefix XOR array and uses a dictionary to efficiently check if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
- The binary search operations (`func_2` and `func_4`) are used appropriately to find the required indices.
- The logic for checking the subarray's interesting property is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
