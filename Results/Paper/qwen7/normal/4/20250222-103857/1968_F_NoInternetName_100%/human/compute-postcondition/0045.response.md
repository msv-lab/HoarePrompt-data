Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the values of `l` and `r` to be the return values of `func_1(int)`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `upper`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `q` is still a positive integer, `l` and `r` are updated to the return values of `func_1(int)`, and `upper` remains defined as the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.
