Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]` to `upper`. Here, `inds[x[l - 1]]` is a list, and `func_3` is a function that takes this list and a lambda function as arguments. The lambda function checks if the elements are less than or equal to `r`. The value of `upper` is determined by finding the appropriate index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` based on the condition. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `lower`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
