Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an argument that is converted to an integer using `int`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `l` and `r`. The values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
