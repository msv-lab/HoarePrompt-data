Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Predicate Usage**: 
   - Functions `func_3` and `func_4` are defined but not used correctly. These functions are meant to find the first index where a condition is met using binary search, but they are not utilized in a way that makes sense for the problem at hand.
   
2. **Predicate Logic in Binary Search**:
   - In `func_4` and `func_3`, the predicates are not correctly implemented for finding indices in the dictionary `inds`. The logic for finding the appropriate indices is flawed and does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **XOR Calculation and Query Handling**:
   - The XOR calculations and handling of subarray queries are correct, but the way indices are being searched and compared is incorrect. Specifically, the use of `func_3` and `func_4` for finding indices is unnecessary and complicates the solution without providing any benefit.

4. **Binary Search Misuse**:
   - The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are not used effectively. They are meant to find the first occurrence of a value in a sorted list, which is not necessary for this problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

(n, q) = func_1(int)
a = list(func_1(int))
x = [0]
inds = defaultdict(list)
inds[0].append(0)
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)

for _ in range(q):
    (l, r) = func_1(int)
    l -= 1  # Adjusting 1-based indexing to 0-based
    if x[l] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = bisect_left(inds[x[r]], l)
    upper = bisect_right(inds[x[l]], r)
    if lower < upper:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version uses `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` from the `bisect` module to find the appropriate indices efficiently, which simplifies the logic and ensures correctness.
