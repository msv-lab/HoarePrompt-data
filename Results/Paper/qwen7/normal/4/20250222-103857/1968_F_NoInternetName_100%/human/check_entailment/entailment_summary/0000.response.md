### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine if a subarray is interesting, meaning it can be divided into \(k > 1\) parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.
   - This involves checking if there exists a way to partition the subarray into segments where the XOR of each segment is the same.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Converts a space-separated string of integers into a list of integers.
   - **func_2**: Performs a binary search to find the leftmost index where a predicate function returns `True`.
   - **func_3**: Checks if all elements in a list satisfy a given predicate.
   - **func_4**: Returns the index found by `func_2` plus one, or `None` if no such index exists.
   - **func_5**: Processes the main logic to determine if a subarray is interesting.

3. **Key Logic in `func_5`**:
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation**: 
     - `x` is a list where `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
     - `inds` is a dictionary mapping each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - **Query Processing**:
     - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if the prefix XOR at `l-1` and `r` are the same.
     - If they are, the subarray is interesting.
     - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the smallest index greater than `l-1` where the prefix XOR matches `x[r]` and the largest index less than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR matches `x[l-1]`.
     - If the upper bound index is greater than the lower bound index, the subarray is interesting.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_5` correctly implements the required functionality.
   - The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient checking of the conditions for subarray interest.
   - The overall structure and implementation align with the problem requirements.
