Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the XOR values match, but it does not handle the XOR operations and index searches correctly.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **XOR Calculation and Index Tracking**: The program calculates the cumulative XOR `x` for the array and uses a dictionary `inds` to track indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs. However, the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is flawed.

2. **Predicate Function Logic**: The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are used to find indices using binary search, but they do not correctly handle the conditions needed to determine if a subarray is interesting.

3. **Incorrect XOR Matching**: The program checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is interesting. It also incorrectly uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find indices, which may not accurately reflect the required conditions.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
4
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
2 3
7 4
12 9 10 9 10 11 9
1 5
1 7
2 6
2 7
11 4
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 2
2 5
6 9
7 11
```

The program fails to correctly identify interesting subarrays in some cases, such as the third and fourth queries in the first test case, and the last three queries in the fifth test case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
