Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1, 2, ...], 1: [1, 2, 4, ...], 2: [2, 4, ...], ...}`, `x` is a list containing all the elements generated by the loop, which starts from `[0]` and appends each new value as the result of `x[-1] ^ i` where `i` is the current digit from the list `a`. The length of `x` will be equal to the sum of the digits in `a` plus one.

In this final state, the dictionary `inds` will contain keys that are the unique values in the list `x` (excluding the initial 0), and the corresponding values will be lists of indices where these values appear in `x`. The list `x` will include all intermediate results generated during the loop's execution, starting from 0 and ending with the last computed value, with each new value being the result of a bitwise XOR operation between the previous value in `x` and the current digit from the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists, and either `upper` is greater than `lower` or `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists. Regardless of whether `upper > lower` is true or false, the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `upper` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than or equal to `l` or the first element if no such element exists, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
