Output State: **`q` now contains the original elements plus `node`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the first element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is False).**

Explanation: The code snippet `q.append(node)` appends the variable `node` to the list `q`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `q` now includes the original elements plus `node`. The other conditions related to `ver`, `graph[ver]`, `node`, and `vis[node]` remain as stated in the initial state.
