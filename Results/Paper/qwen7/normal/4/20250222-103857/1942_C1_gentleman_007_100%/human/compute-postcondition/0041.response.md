Output State: **`q` now contains the node that was appended plus the previously appended node, `ver` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.**

Explanation: The line `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. All other variables (`ver`, `vis[ver]`, and `graph[ver]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
