The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr`. If `mod` is not `-1` and `n` is at least 5, the function returns a fixed list `[1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`. Otherwise, it returns a list containing computed values based on the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` starting from `[1, 0]` up to `n`. After the function concludes, the list `dearr` represents the computed sequence or the fixed sequence as described, and the original inputs `n` and `mod` do not affect the returned list.
