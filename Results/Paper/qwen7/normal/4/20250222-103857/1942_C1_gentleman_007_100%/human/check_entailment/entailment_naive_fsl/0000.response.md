Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. However, the program includes a large number of utility functions and does not define any function that solves the main problem.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many additional vertices can be chosen to maximize the number of triangles. Given `n` vertices and `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is `x * (n - x - 1) / 2`. Since `y = 0`, no additional vertices can be chosen, so the maximum number of triangles is simply `x * (n - x - 1) / 2`.

However, the provided code does not include any function that performs this calculation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
