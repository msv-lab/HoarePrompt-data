First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    return [v for i in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `v`, a list of distinct integers representing the vertices. After executing, it returns a new list where the elements of `v` are repeated `n` times.
Function number 4 :

After executing, it returns a 2D list where each row contains the list of `m` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, repeated `n` times.

        l[y].append(x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list `l` where each element `l[y]` contains a list of all vertices `x` that are directly connected to vertex `y` through the function calls made during the loop's iterations. The function constructs this list by iterating `m` times, each time calling another function `func_1` to get two vertices `x` and `y`, and then adding `x` to the list of `y` and vice versa.

        l[x][y] = 1
        l[y][x] = 1
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. It creates a 2D list `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1) and sets specific elements to 1 based on the output of `func_1()` called three times. After the function completes, it returns the 2D list `l`.

''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a 2D list `l` as input and returns a 2D list `p`. The returned list `p` has dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the input list `l`. The element `p[n+1][m]` contains the sum of all elements in the list `l` plus adjustments for overlapping regions, while all other elements in `p` retain their original values from the initial state.
Function number 9 :

 '''
def func_9(x):

''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It calculates the maximum value between 1 minus the result of `x` AND `x - 1`, and 0. The function then returns this calculated maximum value.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(l):
    a = 0
    for i in l:
        a = gcd(a, i)

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts a positive integer `num` and a list of prime numbers `Prime_array`. It computes the prime factorization of `num` using the prime numbers in `Prime_array`. For each prime factor found, it counts the number of times it divides `num` completely. The function returns a dictionary `d`, where each key is a prime factor of `num` and its value is the total power of that prime factor in the prime factorization of `num`.

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. Each prime factor is a key in the dictionary, and its corresponding value is the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization. If `n` is greater than 1 after processing, the exponent of `n` itself (if it is a prime) is incremented by 1 in the dictionary.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(d):

    for i in d:

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers from 1 to n and values are non-negative integers. It calculates and returns the sum of `pow(i, d[i] - 1) * (i - 1)` for every key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The original dictionary `d` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
Function number 15 :
 Code:

''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It calculates a list of factorial values modulo `mod` up to `n`, and returns this list. Specifically, it computes the factorial of numbers from 1 to `n` and stores these values in a list, taking the result modulo `mod` at each step.
Function number 16 :

''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr`. If `mod` is not `-1` and `n` is at least 5, the function returns a fixed list `[1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`. Otherwise, it returns a list containing computed values based on the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` starting from `[1, 0]` up to `n`. After the function concludes, the list `dearr` represents the computed sequence or the fixed sequence as described, and the original inputs `n` and `mod` do not affect the returned list.

 Output hints for function17:  The function accepts a sorted list of integers `p` and an integer `x`. It searches for the integer `x` within the list `p`. If `x` is found in `p`, it returns the index of `x`; otherwise, it returns -1.

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18` accepts two parameters: `p`, a list of integers representing chosen vertices, and `x`, an integer representing the maximum value a vertex can have. The length of `p` is equal to `x`. The function returns `-1` if the first element of the list `p` exceeds `x`. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the last index `mid` where the elements in `p` are less than or equal to `x`. The function returns `mid`, which is the midpoint of the last valid range found during the search.

 Output hints for function19:  The function accepts a list `p` of integers (sorted in ascending order) and an integer `x` within the range of 1 to the maximum value in `p`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `p`, it returns the length of the list `p`.

 Output hints for function25:  The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which represents a starting node in a graph. If `ver` is less than 0, the function returns "invalid". Otherwise, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to visit all nodes in the graph that are reachable from `ver`. After completing the BFS, the function ensures that all such nodes have been visited at least once, and it returns `ver`.
