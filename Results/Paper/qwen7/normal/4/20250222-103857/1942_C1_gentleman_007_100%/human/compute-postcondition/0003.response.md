The only variable in the loop head is `len(q)`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `len(q)` being greater than 0. Right before the loop, `q` is a deque() instance with `ver` appended to it, which means `len(q)` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`q` is a deque() instance with `ver` appended to it; `vis[ver]` is set to 1**
