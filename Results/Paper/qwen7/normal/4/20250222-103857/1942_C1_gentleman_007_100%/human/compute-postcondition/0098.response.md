Postcondition: **`i` is a positive integer, `j` is `len(b)`, and the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` remains unchanged and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains as `len(b)` and `i` is decremented by 1.**
