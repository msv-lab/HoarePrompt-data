Output State: **`q` contains the node that was appended, `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the deque `q`. This operation does not affect the value of `ver`, which remains the first element in the deque. The condition that `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor is still valid after the code execution.
