Output State: **`q` is a deque() instance with the first element removed; `ver` is the first element of the original deque `q`; `vis[ver]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. The value of `vis[ver]` is set to 1, indicating that `ver` has been visited. The remaining elements in `q` are unaffected, but the structure of `q` changes as it no longer contains its first element.
