Functionality: **The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which represents a starting node in a graph. If `ver` is less than 0, the function returns "invalid". Otherwise, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to visit all nodes in the graph that are reachable from `ver`. After completing the BFS, the function ensures that all such nodes have been visited at least once, and it returns `ver`.**
