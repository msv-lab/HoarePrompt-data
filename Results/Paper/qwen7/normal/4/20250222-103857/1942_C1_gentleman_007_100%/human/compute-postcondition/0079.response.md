Postcondition: **`i` is a non-zero integer, `j` is either `len(b) + 1` or `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`, and if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then no change is made to `i` and `j`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1.**
