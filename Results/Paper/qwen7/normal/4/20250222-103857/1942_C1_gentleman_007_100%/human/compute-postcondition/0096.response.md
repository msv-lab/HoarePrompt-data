Postcondition: `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` remains as `i - 1` and `j` stays as `len(b)`. Otherwise, `j` becomes `len(b) - 1` and `l` (which is a list) is updated to include `a[i]`.
