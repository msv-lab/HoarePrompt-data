Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `node` and `ver`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each `node` in `graph[ver]`.
3. **Determine the postconditions**: 
   - `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element.
   - If `node` is not visited (`vis[node]` is False), then `node` becomes visited (`vis[node]` becomes True).

Given these points, let's analyze the state adjustments needed:

- **`graph[ver]`**: This list must contain at least one element. Since the loop is iterating over this list, it implies that there is at least one element in `graph[ver]` at the start of the loop.
- **`node`**: The loop will pick an element from `graph[ver]` and set `vis[node]` to True if `vis[node]` was False.
- **`vis[node]`**: For the loop to continue, `node` must be set to visited (True) if it was not already visited.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to ensure that the next `node` picked from `graph[ver]` meets the condition of being unvisited and then marking it as visited.

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial state**: `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, and `node` is not visited (or we are about to visit it).
2. **Loop execution**: The loop will pick the next `node` from `graph[ver]`.
3. **Post-loop state**: After the loop picks the next `node`, it will mark `vis[node]` as True if it was previously False.

### Adjusted State:

- `graph[ver]` still contains at least one element.
- `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`.
- `vis[node]` is set to True if it was previously False.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next `node` being picked and marked as visited.

### Final Answer:

State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` is True if it was previously False**.
