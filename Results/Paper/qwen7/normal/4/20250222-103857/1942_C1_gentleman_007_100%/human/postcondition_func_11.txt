The function accepts a positive integer `num` and a list of prime numbers `Prime_array`. It computes the prime factorization of `num` using the prime numbers in `Prime_array`. For each prime factor found, it counts the number of times it divides `num` completely. The function returns a dictionary `d`, where each key is a prime factor of `num` and its value is the total power of that prime factor in the prime factorization of `num`.
