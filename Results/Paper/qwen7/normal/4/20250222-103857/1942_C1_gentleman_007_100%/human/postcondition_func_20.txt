The function accepts three parameters: `a` (an integer), `b` (a non-negative integer), and `mod` (a positive integer). It calculates `a` raised to the power of the sum of the binary representation of `b` (considering only the positions where `b` has 1s), all taken modulo `mod`. The function returns the result `ans`.
