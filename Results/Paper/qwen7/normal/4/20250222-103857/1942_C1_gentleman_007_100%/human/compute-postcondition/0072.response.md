Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `j` is `len(b) + 1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is an empty list, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it a non-zero integer (since it was initially a non-zero integer). All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
