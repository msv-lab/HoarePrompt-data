Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and the deque `q` is empty.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every node that can be reached from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges has been visited exactly once. The deque `q` is now empty because all nodes have been processed and added to it during the loop iterations.
