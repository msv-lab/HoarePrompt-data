Output State: **`q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` and the node `node`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the second element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has now been visited (`vis[node]` is now 1)**.

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node `node` has been visited. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
