The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given vertex `ver`. It marks all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited by updating the `vis` list. After completing the DFS, the function ensures that the `stack` is empty, indicating all reachable vertices have been processed. The `vis` list will have all reachable vertices set to 1, indicating they have been visited, and the `graph` dictionary remains unchanged. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the `vis` list in place.
