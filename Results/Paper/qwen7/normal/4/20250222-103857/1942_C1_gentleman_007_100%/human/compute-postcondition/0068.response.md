Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` in the graph have been visited, and the deque `q` is empty.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all nodes in the graph that can be reached from the starting node `ver` have been visited at least once. The deque `q` is now empty because all nodes that were added to it during the loop iterations have been processed. This means that the loop has successfully traversed the entire connected component of the graph starting from `ver`.
