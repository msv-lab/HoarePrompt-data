The function accepts a non-negative integer \( x \) and returns one of the following based on the value of \( x \):

1. If \( x \) is 0 or 1, it returns \( x \).
2. If \( x \) is greater than 1, it returns the largest integer \( \text{mid} \) such that \( \text{mid}^2 \leq x \), which is effectively the integer part of the square root of \( x \).
