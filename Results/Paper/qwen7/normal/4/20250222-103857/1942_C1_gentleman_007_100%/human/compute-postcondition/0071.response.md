Postcondition: **`i` is a non-zero integer, `j` is `len(b) + 1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is an empty list, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp[i - 1][j]`.**
