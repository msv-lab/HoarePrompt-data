### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the given vertices.
   - Key observation: Any convex polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
   - For a polygon with \( n \) vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( n - 2 \).

2. **Given Constraints**:
   - \( n \) (number of sides of the polygon) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of vertices already chosen by Bessie) ranges from 2 to \( \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \).
   - \( y \) (maximum number of additional vertices you can choose) is 0 in this version of the problem.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - Since \( y = 0 \), Bessie cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles Bessie can form is limited to the number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) vertices she has already chosen.
   - The maximum number of triangles that can be formed using \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \) if \( x \geq 3 \). If \( x = 2 \), no triangles can be formed.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code defines numerous utility functions that are not used in solving the specific problem at hand.
   - The relevant logic should directly compute the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.
   - The code reads the input values \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) and then processes the list of vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - The code correctly identifies the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen, which is \( x - 2 \) if \( x \geq 3 \).

5. **Relevant Code Logic**:
   - The code snippet provided in the annotated version shows the following relevant logic:
     ```python
     for _ in range(int(input())):
         (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
         ans = x - 2
         arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
         arr.sort()
         for i in range(1, x):
             if arr[i - 1] + 2 == arr[i]:
                 ans += 1
         if arr[x - 1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1:
             ans += 1
         if arr[x - 1] == n and arr[0] == 2:
             ans += 1
         print(ans)
     ```
   - This logic correctly handles the constraints and computes the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the code does not implement the necessary logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
