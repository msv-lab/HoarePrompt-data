Output State: **`q` contains the node that was appended, `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis` at index `node` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
