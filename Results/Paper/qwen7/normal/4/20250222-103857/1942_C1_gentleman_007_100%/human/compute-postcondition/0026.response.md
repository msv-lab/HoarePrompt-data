Output State: **`ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, and `q` is updated to remove the first element. All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges have been visited (i.e., `vis[node] == 1` for all such nodes).**

In this output state, the variable `ver` is assigned the value of the first element in the deque `q`. The deque `q` is updated to remove this first element. The condition that all nodes reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's edges have been visited remains unchanged.
