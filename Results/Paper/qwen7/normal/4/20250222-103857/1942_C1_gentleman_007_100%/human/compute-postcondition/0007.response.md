Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `node` and the object `graph[ver]`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `node`**: The loop will iterate over each element in `graph[ver]`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `node` should be one of the elements in `graph[ver]`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `graph[ver]`**: Since the loop will iterate over `graph[ver]`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the Given States**:
   - `q` is a deque instance with the first element removed.
   - `ver` is the first element of the original deque `q`.
   - `vis[ver]` is set to 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The state of `q` and `vis[ver]` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution since they are not used within the loop head.
   - The state of `ver` is relevant because it determines `graph[ver]`.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is `graph[ver]` to ensure it contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element**
