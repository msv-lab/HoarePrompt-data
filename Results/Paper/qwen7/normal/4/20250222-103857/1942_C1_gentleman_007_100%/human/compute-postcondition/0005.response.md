Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `q` is a deque() instance with the first element removed.
   - `ver` is the first element of the original deque `q`.
   - `vis[ver]` is set to 1.

2. **Dequeue Operation**:
   - Since `q` is a deque with the first element removed, it means that `ver` was the first element of `q` before the removal.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(ver, end=' ')`.
   - This will print the value of `ver`.

4. **Value of `ver`**:
   - From the initial state, `ver` is the first element of the original deque `q`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first element of the original deque `q`.

Output: **ver (where ver is the first element of the original deque q)**
