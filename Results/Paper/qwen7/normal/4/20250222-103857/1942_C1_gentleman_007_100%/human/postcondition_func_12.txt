The function accepts an integer `n` such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. Each prime factor is a key in the dictionary, and its corresponding value is the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization. If `n` is greater than 1 after processing, the exponent of `n` itself (if it is a prime) is incremented by 1 in the dictionary.
