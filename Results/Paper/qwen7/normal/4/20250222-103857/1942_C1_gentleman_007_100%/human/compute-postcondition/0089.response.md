Postcondition: `i` is a non-zero integer, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1 and `j` becomes `len(b)` if the decrement occurs due to the condition being true, or `j` remains as `len(b) - 1` if the decrement occurs due to the else condition.
