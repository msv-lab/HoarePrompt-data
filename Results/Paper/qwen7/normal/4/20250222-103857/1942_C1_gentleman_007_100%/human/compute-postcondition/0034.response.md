Postcondition: `ver` is the first element in the deque `q`, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor. If `vis[node]` is currently `False`, then after executing the if statement, `q` now contains the elements `[ver, node]`, and `vis[node]` is set to `True`. If `vis[node]` is already `True`, the condition remains unchanged.
