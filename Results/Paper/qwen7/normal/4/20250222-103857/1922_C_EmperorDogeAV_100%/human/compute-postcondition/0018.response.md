Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and `prog_cities[i]` is the minimum of the absolute differences between `forward` and `cities[i]`, and `cities[i]` and `back`.
