The function accepts a list of city coordinates `cities` and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is set to `1` if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the distances to the next and current city if the index is not the last one, or `0` if it is the last index.
