Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `back` will be `cities[n - 2]`, and `forward` will be `cities[n - 1]` if `n > 1`. For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to `1` if the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`). Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it will remain `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).**

This means that after the loop completes, `prog_cities` will contain `1`s for indices where the next city is closer than the previous city, and the absolute differences for other indices, with the last element potentially being `0` if there is no next city to compare against.
