Output State: The final state of `prog_cities` will be a list of length `n-1` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the `cities` list.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, each element in `prog_cities` will be determined based on the comparison of the absolute differences between the current city coordinate and its neighbors. Specifically:
- If the absolute difference between the next city and the current city is smaller than the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to 1.
- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city if it's within bounds, or remain as 0 if it's the last city.

This process effectively marks the positions where the next city is closer than the previous one with a 1, and records the magnitude of the difference otherwise.
