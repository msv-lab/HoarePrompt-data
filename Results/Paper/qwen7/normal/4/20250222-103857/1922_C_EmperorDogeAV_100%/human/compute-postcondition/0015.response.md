Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and if `i` is less than `n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. Additionally, the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.
