Output State: **The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is determined based on the conditions described. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`:

- If the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it remains `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).**

This means the list `prog_cities` will contain a series of values based on the comparison and calculation rules specified, reflecting the relative distances between consecutive cities as per the given logic.
