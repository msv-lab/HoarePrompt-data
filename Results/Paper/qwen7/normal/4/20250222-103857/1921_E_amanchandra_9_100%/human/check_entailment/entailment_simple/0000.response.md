Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program checks if `a > c` (Alice's row position is greater than Bob's row position). If this condition is true, it directly prints 'Draw'. This is a correct approach because if Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, Alice cannot win since she can only move down, and Bob can always move up without being captured.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions (`abs(a - c)`). This is used to determine how many moves it would take for Alice to reach Bob's row if she were to move optimally towards Bob.

4. **Even Distance Case**: If the distance is even, the program calculates the range of columns where Alice can potentially capture Bob (`l` and `r`). It then checks if Bob's column position falls within this range. If it does, Alice can capture Bob, so the program prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

5. **Odd Distance Case**: If the distance is odd, the program calculates a similar range but checks if Bob's column position is within this range. If it is, Bob can capture Alice, so the program prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the calculated ranges might go out of bounds (i.e., `l` or `r` might be less than 1 or greater than `w`). This is done using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`.

7. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the logic described above. The output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the provided rules and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
