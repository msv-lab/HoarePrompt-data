Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `r` (rows), `w` (columns), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `a > c`. If true, it prints 'Draw'. This condition is correct because if Alice starts higher than Bob, Alice cannot win since she can only move down, and Bob can always move up without being captured.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calculates the vertical distance between Alice and Bob (`x = abs(a - c)`).
   - If this distance is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), it calculates the range of possible moves for Alice (`l` and `r`) and checks if Bob's position falls within this range.
     - If Bob's position `b` is within `[l, r]`, Alice can capture Bob, so Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If the distance is even, it calculates the range of possible moves for Bob (`l` and `r`) and checks if Alice's position `d` falls within this range.
     - If Alice's position `d` is within `[l, r]`, Bob can capture Alice, so Bob wins.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

### Correctness Check:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where Alice starts higher than Bob correctly by printing 'Draw'.
  - The logic for odd and even distances seems to cover most scenarios where Alice and Bob can or cannot capture each other.

- **General Logic:**
  - The logic for determining the ranges and checking if the opponent's position falls within these ranges appears to be sound.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the conditions, which matches the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to handle the problem correctly according to the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
