Output: **Draw**

Explanation: The print statement simply outputs the string "Draw". According to the initial state, none of the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `t` are relevant to the print statement. The condition that `a` is greater than `c` does not affect the output of the print statement either. Therefore, the only thing printed is the string "Draw".
