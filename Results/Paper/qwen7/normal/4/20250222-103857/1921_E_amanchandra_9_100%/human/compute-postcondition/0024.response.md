Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x is even), `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` keep their original values, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x is even), `r` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[0])`, `w` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[1])`, `a` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[2])`, `b` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[3])`, `c` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[4])`, `d` is assigned the value of `int(input().split()[5])`**.

This means that the values of `t`, `r`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been updated based on user input, while `w` and `x` retain their original values from the initial state.
