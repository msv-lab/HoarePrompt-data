Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case**: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Alice starts at (2, 2), Bob at (5, 3).
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left. Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3). Bob can move to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 4).
   - If Alice moves to (3, 2), Bob can move to (4, 3), and so on. The program incorrectly determines the result based on the relative positions without considering the optimal moves.

2. **Test Case**: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Alice starts at (2, 1), Bob at (4, 1).
   - Alice can only move down to (3, 1). Bob can move up to (3, 1).
   - Since both players can move to the same cell, the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly prints "Alice".

The program fails to account for the optimal moves and the game rules correctly. Therefore, it is not fully correct.
