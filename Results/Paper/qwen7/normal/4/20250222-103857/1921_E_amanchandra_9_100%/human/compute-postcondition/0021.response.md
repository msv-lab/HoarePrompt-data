Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even), `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` keep their original values, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even). If `a` is greater than `c`, then `a` remains greater than `c`.
