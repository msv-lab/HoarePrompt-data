Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `t` is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - `w` is the value of the first input integer.
   - `a` is the value of the second input integer.
   - `b` is the value of the third input integer.
   - `c` is the value of the fourth input integer.
   - `d` is the value of the fifth input integer.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
   - `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
   ```

   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(['Draw'], ['Alice'])`.
   - The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is evaluated.
     - If both conditions are true, the tuple index `[1]` is selected, resulting in `['Alice']`.
     - If either condition is false, the tuple index `[0]` is selected, resulting in `['Draw']`.

3. **Determine the Condition:**
   - We need to determine if `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are true.
   - Since the exact values of `l`, `b`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether these conditions are true or false without more specific values.

However, based on the structure of the problem, we can infer that the output will depend on the truth value of the conditions. Without specific values, we can only describe the potential outputs.

Given the nature of the problem and the conditions, let's assume the conditions evaluate to true for the sake of providing a concrete example:

- If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are true, then the output will be `['Alice']`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **['Alice']**
