Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer is the index (i + 1) of '>' in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each element, if the character is '>', it calculates the index (i) plus one and adds it to the list `pre`. The length of `s1` remains `n`, and the content of `s1` remains unchanged. The new list `pre` contains the positions (indices + 1) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
