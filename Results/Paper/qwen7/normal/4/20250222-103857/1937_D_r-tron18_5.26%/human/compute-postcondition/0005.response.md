Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which is used as the loop control variable.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until `i` reaches -1. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be `n - 1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop starts with `i = n - 1` and decrements, the loop will execute as long as `n - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is `n - 1` and that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`.
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers where each integer is the index (i + 1) of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0.
- `suffZero` is a list containing 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `i` and the condition `n > 0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
