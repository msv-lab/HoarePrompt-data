Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is recalculated, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `2 * suffZero[-1]` to `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero` is a list, `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element of the list. Therefore, `zeroInd` is set to twice the value of the last element of `suffZero`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
