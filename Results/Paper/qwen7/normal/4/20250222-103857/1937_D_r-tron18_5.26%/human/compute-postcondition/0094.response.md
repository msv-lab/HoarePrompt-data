Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the following conditions:
- If `el == '>'` and `totalOne - 1` is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` depending on the relationship between `totalOne - 1` and `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- If `el != '>'` (or `el` is not provided), then `suffZero` has its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, or `zeroInd - oneInd` if `zr > ol`, with `ol` and `zr` updated accordingly.**
