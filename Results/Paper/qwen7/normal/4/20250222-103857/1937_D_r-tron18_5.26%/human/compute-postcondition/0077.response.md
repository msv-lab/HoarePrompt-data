Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments. The first call uses `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and the second call uses `preOne` and `zr + 1` as arguments. The results of these two calls are added together to assign the new value to `oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
