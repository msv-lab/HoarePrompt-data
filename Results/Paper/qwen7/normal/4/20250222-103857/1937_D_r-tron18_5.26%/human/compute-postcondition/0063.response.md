Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is recalculated, `el` is now `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `zeroInd` by calling `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` twice and performing arithmetic operations. The values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `oneInd`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged except for `zeroInd`, which is calculated based on the function calls.
