Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * (preOne[-2])`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, and `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`. The values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd` are updated as per the given operations. The updated values of `ol` and `zr` are directly assigned from the expressions provided.
