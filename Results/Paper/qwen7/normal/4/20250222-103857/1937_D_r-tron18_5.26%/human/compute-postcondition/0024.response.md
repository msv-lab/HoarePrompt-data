Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `totalOne` is decremented by 1, so `totalOne` becomes `totalOne - 1`. All other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
