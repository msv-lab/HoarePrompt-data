Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; and `n`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The function returns a value based on the content of the string `s1`.**

This means the function checks the string `s1` to determine its content and returns a value accordingly, given that `s1` is of length `n` and consists only of '<' and '>' characters.
