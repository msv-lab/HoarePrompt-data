Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`. Depending on whether `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are either calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd - fi` where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr). The value of `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**
