Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated (if `el == '>'`), `totalOne` is updated (if `el == '>'`), and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the following rules:
- If `el == '>'`, then `i` is updated to `n - 3`, `el` is set to `'> '`, `ol` remains unchanged, `zr` remains unchanged, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, and `totalOne` is decreased by 1.
- Otherwise, `suffZero` is updated such that its last element is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` remains unchanged, `zr` remains unchanged, and `ans[i]` is calculated as follows:
  - If `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
  - Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
  - In both cases, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
