Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is now `s1[i]`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `el` to be equal to `s1[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is now `s1[n - 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
