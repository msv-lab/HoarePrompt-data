Output State: **All elements in `ans` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop.**

After the loop completes all its iterations, the final state of the `ans` list will contain values calculated according to the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically:

- For each character in `s1` from the end to the beginning:
  - If the character is `'>',` the value of `ans[i]` is determined based on the balance between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` calculations involving `preOne` and `suffZero`.
  - If the character is `'<'`, the value of `ans[i]` is calculated using the updated `suffZero` list and the current position `i`.

The `preOne` list is continuously updated by removing the last element after each iteration, and the `totalOne` variable decreases by one each time an `'> '` is processed. The `suffZero` list accumulates values based on the positions of `'<'` characters.

By the end of the loop, every element in `ans` will have been assigned a value based on the logic described, reflecting the final state of the computation over the entire string `s1`.
