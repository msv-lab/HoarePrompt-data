Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is now `s1[i]`**.

This means that the variables `ol` and `zr` have been updated to reflect the current state of `totalOne` and the length of `suffZero` minus one, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
