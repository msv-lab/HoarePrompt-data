Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. The values of `i`, `el`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged from their initial states.
