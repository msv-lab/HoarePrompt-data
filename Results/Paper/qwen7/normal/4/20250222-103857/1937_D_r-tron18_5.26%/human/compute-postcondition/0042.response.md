Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop runs in reverse from `n - 1` to `0`. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Update the states based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 3`.

4. **Check the conditions for updating other variables**:
   - `el` is `s1[n - 2]`.
   - `suffZero` remains the same.
   - `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is updated to `totalOne - 1`.
   - `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) remains the same.
   - `preOne` is updated by removing the last element.
   - `totalOne` is updated to `totalOne - 1`.

5. **Calculate `zeroInd` and `oneInd`**:
   - Since `i` is `n - 3` (which is `n - 2 - 1`), it matches the condition `i` is `n - 3`.
   - Therefore, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.

6. **Update `ans[i]`**:
   - `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

Given these steps, the states at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 3]`.
- `suffZero` remains the same.
- `ol` is `totalOne - 1`.
- `zr` remains the same.
- `preOne` is updated by removing the last element.
- `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1**.
