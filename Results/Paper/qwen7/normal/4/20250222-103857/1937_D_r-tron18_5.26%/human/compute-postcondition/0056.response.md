Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `fi` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the `preOne` list. This operation affects `preOne` but does not provide enough information to recalculate `zeroInd` and `oneInd` directly without knowing the exact values of `totalOne`, `suffZero`, and the results of the functions `func_1`. Since `fi` is only defined if the else part is executed, and we don't know which part was executed, `fi` remains undefined. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state except for `preOne`, which now has one less element.
