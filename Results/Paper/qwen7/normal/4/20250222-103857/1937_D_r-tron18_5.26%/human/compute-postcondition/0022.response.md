Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `totalOne` is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined as specified in the respective if and else parts.
