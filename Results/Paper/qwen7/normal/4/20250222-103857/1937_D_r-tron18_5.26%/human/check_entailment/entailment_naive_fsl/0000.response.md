Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` attempts to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid, but it does not properly handle the inversion of characters and the movement logic. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
3
>><>
```
The expected output should be:
```
4 3 2 3
```
However, the provided program does not produce this output. Instead, it seems to be calculating something different, likely due to the incorrect handling of the inversion and movement logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
