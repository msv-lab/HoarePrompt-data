Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is recalculated, `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, and `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `n - 4`.
- The value of `el` remains `s1[i]`.
- The value of `suffZero` remains a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- The value of `ol` remains `totalOne - 1`.
- The value of `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `preOne` is updated by removing the last element.
- `totalOne` is updated to `totalOne - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- `oneInd` is recalculated.
- `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`.
- `ol` is now `totalOne`.
- `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.
