The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `times`. It returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index calculated as `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)` in the list `arr`. This calculation ensures that the index is within the bounds of the list, even if `times` is negative.
