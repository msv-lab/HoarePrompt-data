Output State: **`t` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `r` is an empty string, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, and `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `r`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged and retain their initial states. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from user input.
