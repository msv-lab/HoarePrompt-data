Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the information provided, `r` is increased by the value at index `x` in list `s`, and `b[x]` is increased by 1. However, these details are not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be a valid element in the list `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty list of integers, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `s`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will take the next element from the list `s`.
   - The list `s` will be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, but with one less element (since one element has already been processed).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be the next element in the list `s`.
- `s` will be the list `s` without the first element (since `i` has already been processed).

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in the list `s`, `s` is the list `s` without the first element**
