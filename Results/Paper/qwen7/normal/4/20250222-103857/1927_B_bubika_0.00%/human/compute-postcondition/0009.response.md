Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
