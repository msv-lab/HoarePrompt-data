Output State: **`t` is 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `r` is an empty string, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, and `n` is an input integer.**

The code `r = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
