Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` based on the first element of each tuple. Since each tuple in `coord` contains two elements (`'x', 'y'`), sorting will order the tuples based on the `'x'` value. The other variables remain unchanged: `res` stays at 0, `n` must still be non-zero, `i` remains 3, and `x` and `y` remain as input integers from the previous iterations.
