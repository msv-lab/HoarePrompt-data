The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted such that `n` is non-zero.

State: **`n` must be non-zero**
