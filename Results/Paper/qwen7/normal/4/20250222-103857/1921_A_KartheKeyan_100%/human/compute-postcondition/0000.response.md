Output State: **There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; n is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the while loop; s is updated by adding \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each value of \(l\) read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of iterations for the while loop. For each iteration, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\), prints the value of `s`, and then decrements `n` by 1. After the loop completes, the initial state of the coordinates of the square remains unchanged, but `n` is reduced by the number of iterations performed, and `s` is updated for each value of `l`.
