Output State: **`res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

The code `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`, which clears its previous content. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
