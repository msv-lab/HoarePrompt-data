Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the area of the square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distances between certain points. However, the logic for determining the side length of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between the first two points and the last two points, which may not necessarily correspond to the side length of the square.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
-1 1
1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
-1 1
1 1
11 11
1 11
11 1
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
4
4
```

However, the program will output incorrect results because it incorrectly calculates the distances. For example, in the first test case, the program will calculate the distance between (1, 1) and (-1, -1), which is not the side length of the square. The correct approach would be to ensure that the calculated distances represent the side length of the square.

A correct solution would involve identifying the unique pairs of points that form the sides of the square and ensuring that the distances between these points are equal.
