Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is [(x, y)], `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`, the values of `x` and `y` are updated by `map(int, input().split())`**.

This means that the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the integers input by the user, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The calculation for `p1` and `p2` will depend on the new values of `x` and `y` once they are input.
