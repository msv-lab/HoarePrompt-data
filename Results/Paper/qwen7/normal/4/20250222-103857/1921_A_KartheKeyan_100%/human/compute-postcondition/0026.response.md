Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `i` must be 0, 1, or 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`, `x` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `y` is assigned the value of the second input integer.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `coord`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
