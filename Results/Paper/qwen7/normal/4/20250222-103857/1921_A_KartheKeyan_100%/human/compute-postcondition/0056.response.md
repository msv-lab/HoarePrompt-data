Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer)], `p1` is 0, `res` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, the list `coord` is sorted based on the tuples' first element `x` and second element `y`.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` based on the tuples it contains. Since each tuple in `coord` consists of two integers `(x, y)`, the list is sorted in ascending order based on the first element `x` and then by the second element `y` if the first elements are equal. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `p1`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as the sorting operation does not modify these variables.
