Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(x, y)], `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is 0, `res` is 0**.

The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` is an empty list. After appending the tuple `(x, y)`, `coord` becomes a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
