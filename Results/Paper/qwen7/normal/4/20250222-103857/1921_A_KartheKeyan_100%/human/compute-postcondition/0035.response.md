Output State: `total` is 0, `n` is 4, `coord` is a list containing four tuples \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\), and \((x_4, y_4)\), where each pair \((x_i, y_i)\) is an input integer from the user, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches 3), `coord` will contain four points provided by the user, `n` will be 4 (since the loop runs 4 times), and `i` will be 3 as it has reached the end of the loop. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last input integers provided by the user, and `p1` and `p2` will be calculated based on the last two points added to `coord`.
