Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`)], `p1` is 0, `res` is 0.

After the loop executes all 4 iterations, the variable `i` will be 3 since the loop runs from `i` in range(4). The variable `total` remains 0 as there's no code in the loop that modifies it. The variable `n` remains 3 as it was initialized and not modified within the loop. The list `coord` will contain 4 pairs of coordinates because the loop appends two new coordinate pairs each time it runs, and it runs 4 times in total. The variable `p1` remains 0 as it is not modified by the loop. The variable `res` remains 0 for the same reason. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last input values provided when the loop finishes, as they are reassigned in each iteration of the loop.
