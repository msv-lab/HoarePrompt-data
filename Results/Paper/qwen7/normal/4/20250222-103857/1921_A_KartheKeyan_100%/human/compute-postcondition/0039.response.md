Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 4, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])**² + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])**², `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])**² + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])**², `res` is math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])**² + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])**²) * math.sqrt((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])**² + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])**²)**

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance between two pairs of points in the `coord` list and multiplies these distances together. The result is stored in the variable `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
