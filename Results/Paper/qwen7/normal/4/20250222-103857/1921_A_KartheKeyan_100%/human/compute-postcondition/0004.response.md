Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value 0. The initial conditions for `n` (must be non-zero) and `coord` (is an empty list) remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions and the initial values of the variables are still valid in the output state.
