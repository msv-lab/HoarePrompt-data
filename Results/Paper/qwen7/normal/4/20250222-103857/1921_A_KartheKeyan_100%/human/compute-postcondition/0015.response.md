Output State: `res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('x', 'y'), ('x', 'y'), ('x', 'y'), ('x', 'y')]`, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.

This means that after the loop has executed all 4 iterations, the variable `res` remains unchanged at 0, `n` must still be non-zero, and `coord` will contain four tuples of coordinates `(x, y)` that were input during each iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be 3, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
