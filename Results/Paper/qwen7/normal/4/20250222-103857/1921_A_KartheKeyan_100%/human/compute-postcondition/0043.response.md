Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 3, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is 0**

Explanation: The line `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This clears the previous list that was sorted by their first elements. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous values or states.
