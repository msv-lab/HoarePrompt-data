Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 0
   - `a` is the first integer entered
   - `b` is the second integer entered
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, then no changes are made. Otherwise, either `a` divided by 2 equals `b` or `b` divided by 2 equals `a`, or neither `a` nor `b` is divisible by the other.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, and if both `a` and `b` are odd, then no changes are made. Otherwise, either `a` divided by 2 equals `b` or `b` divided by 2 equals `a`, or neither `a` nor `b` is divisible by the other.**
