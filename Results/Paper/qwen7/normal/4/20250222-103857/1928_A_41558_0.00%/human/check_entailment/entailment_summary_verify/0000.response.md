### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
- He can then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.
- The goal is to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the original one.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if \(a\) and \(b\) are both odd or if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: 
   - The program correctly identifies that if both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no new rectangle can be formed because cutting an odd dimension results in two smaller odd dimensions, and rearranging them won't yield a different rectangle.
   
2. **Half-Dimension Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if one dimension is exactly half of the other, no new rectangle can be formed because cutting the larger dimension into two equal parts results in two identical smaller rectangles, and rearranging them won't yield a different rectangle.

3. **Even Dimensions Check**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if at least one dimension is even. According to the problem, if either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - For example, for the input `2 4`, the program should output 'YES' because:
     - Cutting the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles.
     - Rearranging the 2x2 rectangles to form a 4x2 rectangle.
   - However, the current implementation would incorrectly output 'NO' because it only checks for odd dimensions and half-dimensions.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to handle the case where at least one dimension is even. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
