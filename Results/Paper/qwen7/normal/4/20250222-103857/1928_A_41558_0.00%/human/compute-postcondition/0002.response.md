Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
