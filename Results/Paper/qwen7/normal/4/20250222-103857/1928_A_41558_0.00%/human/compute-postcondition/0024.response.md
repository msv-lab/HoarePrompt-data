Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers entered, respectively, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. If `a` is odd and `b` is odd, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.**
