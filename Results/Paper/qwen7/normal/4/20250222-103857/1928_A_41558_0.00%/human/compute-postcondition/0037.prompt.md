You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `n` is the total number of iterations the loop will execute, which means after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. Variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered through input during the last iteration of the loop. No further changes are made to `a` and `b` within the loop based on the given conditions. The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated `n` times, with each iteration checking the conditions on the input values `a` and `b` as described.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the relationship between a and b.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
