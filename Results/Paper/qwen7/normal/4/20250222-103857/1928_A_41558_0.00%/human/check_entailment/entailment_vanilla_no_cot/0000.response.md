Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` checks if both dimensions are odd. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO'. However, this is not the complete logic needed. A rectangle with both dimensions odd can still be cut into smaller rectangles that can form another rectangle. For example, a 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle.

2. **Special Case Check**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. If this is true, it prints 'NO'. This is also not sufficient. For example, a 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 2x4 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated.

3. **General Logic**: The general logic should be that if either dimension is even, or if the rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles that can form another distinct rectangle, then it should print 'YES'. The current implementation does not cover all such cases.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # If either dimension is even, we can always form another rectangle
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # If both dimensions are odd, check if we can form another rectangle
            if a * b > 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if either dimension is even, which guarantees that another rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, it further checks if the area of the rectangle is greater than 1 (i.e., the rectangle is not a single unit square), which allows forming another rectangle through cutting and rearranging.
