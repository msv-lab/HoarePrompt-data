Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to `k-2`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The values of `i`, `k`, `a`, `ans2`, and `ans` are updated accordingly based on the operation performed on `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
