Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - The expression `ans1` is updated as `ans1 - a[2] * 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented and `i < x` must still hold true.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 3 (since `i` will be 3).

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `x` must be greater than 3.

6. **Consider the expression involving `ans1`**: The value of `ans1` is updated based on the previous state, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not need to explicitly mention `ans1` in the state update.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 3**
