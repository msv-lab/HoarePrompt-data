Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to k-1, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, and `ans2` is equal to `ans1`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]` and `ans2` is updated accordingly; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. This does not change the values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `a[i]`, or `x` (as they are not re-assigned), nor does it affect the condition `if i + x < n`. The condition remains the same, and the values of `ans1` and `ans2` are still as described, with `ans2` being equal to `ans1`.
