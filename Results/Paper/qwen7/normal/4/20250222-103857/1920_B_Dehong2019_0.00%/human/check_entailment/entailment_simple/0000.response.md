Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
3. It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.
4. The variable `ans1` is initialized with the sum of the sorted array.
5. A loop runs `x` times, where each iteration subtracts twice the value of the current smallest element from `ans1`. This is done to simulate Bob's optimal strategy of negating the smallest elements.
6. Another loop runs `k` times, where each iteration adds the value of the current smallest element to `ans1` and then potentially subtracts twice the value of the corresponding element after negations by Bob. This simulates Alice's optimal strategy of removing elements.
7. The final result is determined by taking the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` (which is initially set to `ans1`).

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. The program accounts for both Alice's removal of up to `k` elements and Bob's negation of up to `x` elements, ensuring the sum of the array is maximized under these constraints.

Correctness: **True**
