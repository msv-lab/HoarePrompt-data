Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
2. The function initializes `t` and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.
4. The array `a` is sorted in descending order.
5. `ans1` is initially set to the sum of all elements in `a`.
6. It then adjusts `ans1` by subtracting twice the first `x` elements.
7. `ans2` is initialized to `ans1`.
8. It further adjusts `ans2` by adding the first `k` elements and subtracting twice the elements at indices `x + i` where `i < k` and `i + x < n`.
9. Finally, it prints the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the function correctly implements the strategy for both players to play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements, and Bob aims to minimize the sum by negating the largest remaining elements. The function correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
