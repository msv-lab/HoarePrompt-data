Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[3]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[3]`. Since `i` is 3, the code accesses `a[3]` and multiplies its value by 2 before subtracting it from `ans1`. The initial state of `i` being 3 is preserved, and the updated value of `ans1` reflects the subtraction.
