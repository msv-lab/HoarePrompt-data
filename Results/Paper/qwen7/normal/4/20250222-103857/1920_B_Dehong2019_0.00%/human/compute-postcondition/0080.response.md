Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(x)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < x`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans1` is `ans1 - a[1] * 2`

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `x > 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state such that `i` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2), and `ans1` is updated based on the loop body operation, which is `ans1 - a[1] * 2`.

5. **Update `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it executes, `i` will become 2.

6. **Update `ans1`**: The operation `ans1` undergoes in each iteration is `ans1 - a[1] * 2`. Since this operation happens once per iteration, after the first iteration, `ans1` is already updated. Therefore, for the next iteration, `ans1` will be further updated by `ans1 - a[1] * 2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2
- `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[1] * 2` (from the previous iteration)

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` is `ans1 - a[1] * 2`**
