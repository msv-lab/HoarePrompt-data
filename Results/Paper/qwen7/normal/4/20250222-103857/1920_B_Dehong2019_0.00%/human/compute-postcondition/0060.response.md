Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to `k-2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i + 1]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ans1` is updated, and `ans2` is still equal to `ans1`, while `ans` remains the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
