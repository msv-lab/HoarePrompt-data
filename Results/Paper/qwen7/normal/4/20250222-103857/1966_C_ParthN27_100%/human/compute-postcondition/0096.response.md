Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string using `input().split()`, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `arr`. The initial state of `i` and `s` remains unchanged, `n` is the length of the updated `s` (which includes the additional 0), and `ans` remains 1. The value of `arr` is now a list of integers input by the user.
