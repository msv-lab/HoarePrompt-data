Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, ans is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is being XORed with 1 (`ans ^= 1`). Given that no initial value for `ans` is provided, we assume it starts as 0 (common default for bitwise operations). XORing 0 with 1 results in 1. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` must still be greater than 3, and `ans` is now 1.
