Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the initial number of stones in each pile. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `i` is `n-1` and `ans` is the result of performing the XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1. If `ans` is true, then `i` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1, and if `n` equals 2, then `i` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is either the same as its previous value or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, and `ans` is 1. If the length of `s` is 2, the postcondition remains as described. If the length of `s` is not 2, `i` is 3, and `ans` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
