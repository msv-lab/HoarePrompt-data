Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. These integers are then collected into a list named `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was just the number of inputs expected, not the inputs themselves.
