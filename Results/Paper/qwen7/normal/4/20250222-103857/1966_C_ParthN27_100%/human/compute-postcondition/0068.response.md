Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` should take values from 1 up to `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `ans` is 1.

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range [1, n-1]. Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, it needs to be adjusted to be within this range.
   - `n` is already correctly set as the length of `s`, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - `ans` is not part of the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `ans`.
   - `s` is not part of the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `s`.

5. **Adjust `i` to be within the range [1, n-1]**:
   - To start the loop, `i` must be set to 1 (the smallest value in the range) and `n` must be greater than 1 (since the upper limit of the range is `n-1`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
