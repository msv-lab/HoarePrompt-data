Output State: **`i` is between 2 and `n-2` (inclusive), `s` is a set containing `arr[i-1]`, `arr[i]`, and `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, adding `arr[i]` to `s` again does not change the set's contents. Therefore, `s` still contains `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is also unchanged.
