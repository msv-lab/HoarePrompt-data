Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, and upon completion, `i` will increment to `n`. The set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr` because each element of `arr` is added to the set `s` in each iteration of the loop.
