Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 2.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at each iteration, after the current iteration, `i` will become 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 3; `i` is 3**
