Output State: `n` must be equal to or greater than 4; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` contains `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, ..., `arr[n-1]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be equal to or greater than 4 (since the loop runs `n` times), `i` will be equal to `n` (as it increments by 1 in each iteration up to `n-1`), and the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr` starting from `arr[0]` up to `arr[n-1]`.
