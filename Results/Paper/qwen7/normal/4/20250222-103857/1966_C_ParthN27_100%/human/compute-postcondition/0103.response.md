Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` is a set containing the elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contains the elements `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]`. After adding `arr[i]` to the set, `s` now contains `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` (since `arr[i]` was already present and sets do not allow duplicate elements). All other variables remain unchanged.
