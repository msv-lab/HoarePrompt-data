Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` remains the same as its previous value.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement context provided, the variables `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still greater than 1, and `ans` retains its previous value based on the condition `s[3] - s[2] > 1`.
