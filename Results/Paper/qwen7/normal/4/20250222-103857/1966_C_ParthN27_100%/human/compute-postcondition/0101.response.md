Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `s` is a set containing the elements `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` was previously `i + 2`, the current value of `i` is now `i + 2`. The set `s` initially contained the element `arr[i+1]`, and after adding `arr[i]`, it now contains both `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]`. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged.
