Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` contains `arr[0]`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 0.
   - The variable `s` does not change within the loop head and is not affected by the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `s` contains `arr[0]`**
