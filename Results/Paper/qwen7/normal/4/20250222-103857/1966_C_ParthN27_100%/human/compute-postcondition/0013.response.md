Output State: **`n` is equal to or greater than 4; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a list containing sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.**

The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. Since `s` originally contains the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, after sorting, `s` will contain these elements in sorted order. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
