Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `n` being equal to or greater than 4 is preserved since `len(s)` will be at least 1 (since `s` contains `[0]` and possibly more elements).
