Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive).
   - `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `s` remains unchanged because the set `s` is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `s` is a set containing `arr[i-1]`**.

However, to be precise and ensure the loop condition is met, we should express it as:

State: **`i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `s` is a set containing `arr[i-1]`**.
