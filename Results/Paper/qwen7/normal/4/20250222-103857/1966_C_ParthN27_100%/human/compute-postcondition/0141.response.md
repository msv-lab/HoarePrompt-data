Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, and `ans` is 1. If the length of `s` is 2, the postcondition remains as described. If the length of `s` is not 2, `i` is 3, and `ans` remains 1.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, regardless of how many times the loop executed, the final state will always be that `i` is equal to `n`, `s` contains all unique elements from the input list `arr` sorted and prepended with a 0, `n` is the length of `s`, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is 2, the game ends immediately, and Alice wins. Otherwise, `i` will be 3 (indicating no break occurred in the loop) and `ans` will be 1, meaning Bob wins.
