Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0 and `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.
