Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the condition for the loop to continue does not depend on modifying `n`; it only depends on `i` being less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
