Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the value `0` to the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`, `s` now starts with `0` followed by the sorted unique elements from `arr`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `ans` stays as `1`.
