Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - The postcondition states that if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `ans` is updated based on its previous value, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(1, n - 1)` means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 2`).

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `s`.
   - The postcondition for the next iteration is that `s[2] - s[1]` should be less than or equal to 1. If this condition is met, `ans` will be updated accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of `s`**
