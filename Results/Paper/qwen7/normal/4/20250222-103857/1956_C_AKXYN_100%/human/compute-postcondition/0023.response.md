Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be exactly 1, `i` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 499, and after three iterations, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`, it means that `n` has been reduced to 1 after the loop completes. When `n` becomes 1, the loop terminates because `i` would then be 0, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, the final state of `n` is 1, and `i` is 0. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
