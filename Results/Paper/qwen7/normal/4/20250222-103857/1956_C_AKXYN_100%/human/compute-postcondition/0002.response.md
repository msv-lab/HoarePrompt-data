Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to n**.

Explanation: The code creates a matrix (a list of lists) where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. The number of rows in the matrix is also `n`. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values, while a new variable `mat` is created and assigned the generated matrix.
