Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop control. In this case, the loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 204
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to 0

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be `k-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is the starting point of the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `res` remains 204.
   - `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` must now be \(k-1\), where \(k\) was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express it in terms of the decrement:

State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`**
