Output State: **`res` is 2 + 3 * 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The initial value of `res` is 1. The code updates `res` by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` is updated to `1 + 6 = 7`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `mat`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
