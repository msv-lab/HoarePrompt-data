Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not needed for the print statement.
- `n` must be 7.
- `i` is `n`, so `i` is 7.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Breaking it down:
- `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 7. So, this part becomes `'2 7'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object from 1 to `n + 1`, where `n` is 7. This results in the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:
```
2 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

Output: **2 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7**
