Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each `n`, it calculates a value `res` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` summed over all rows of a matrix `mat` of size `n x n`. It then prints `res` and `2 * n`. Following this, it prints two sequences of numbers from 1 to `n` for each row in reverse order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
