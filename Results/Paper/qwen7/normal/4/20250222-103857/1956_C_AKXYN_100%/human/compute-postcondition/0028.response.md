Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must remain less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` must be 1 (to allow the first iteration).
- `n` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop can continue).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
