Output: **1 5 6 7**

Explanation:
- `res` is explicitly given as 140, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), but its value is not needed for the print statement.
- `n` is explicitly given as 7.
- `i` is explicitly given as 5.

The print statement `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))` does the following:
1. `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` (which is 5), resulting in `'1 5'`.
2. `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object from 1 to `n + 1` (which is 8), so it prints the numbers 1 through 7.

Combining these, the output is `1 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`, but since the `1 %d` part only includes the number 5 once, the final output is `1 5 6 7`.
