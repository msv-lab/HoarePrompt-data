Output State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a matrix (list of lists) named `mat` where each row is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `res` remains 204, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, `n` remains an input integer, and `i` remains 0.
