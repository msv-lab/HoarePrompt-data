Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 6.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `res` remains 6.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 3.

So, the final state is:
**`res` is 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3**.
