Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements using at most 2n operations.
2. The provided solution initializes a matrix `mat` with values from 1 to n for each row, which is a valid initial configuration since all elements are zero initially.
3. The variable `res` is calculated using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) and summed up for each row. This formula seems to be derived from the sum of squares of the first i natural numbers, which is a valid approach to maximize the sum.
4. The solution prints the result `res` and the number of operations required, which is `n << 1` (i.e., 2n). This matches the problem's requirement.
5. The nested loops correctly apply the operations in a way that ensures each element in the matrix is set to its maximum possible value within the constraints.

Given the above points, the provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements and adhere to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
