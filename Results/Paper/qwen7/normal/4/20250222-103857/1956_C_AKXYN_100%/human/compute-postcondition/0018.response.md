Given the initial state:
- `res` is 204
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the print statement:
1. `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 2.
2. `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` into separate arguments for the print function.

Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we need to consider the constraints:
- `i` must be in the range \([0, n)\)
- `n` must be at least 1.

For the sake of providing a precise answer, let's assume a specific example within the given constraints. Suppose `i = 3` and `n = 5` (these values satisfy the conditions).

Then the print statement would be:
```python
print('2 3', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

This would output:
```
2 3 1 2 3 4 5
```

Output: **2 [i] [1, 2, ..., n]** (where `[i]` is the value of `i` and `[1, 2, ..., n]` is the range from 1 to `n + 1`). 

For the specific example with `i = 3` and `n = 5`, the output would be:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5**
