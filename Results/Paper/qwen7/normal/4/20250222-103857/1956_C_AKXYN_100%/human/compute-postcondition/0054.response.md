Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because the value of `n` does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `res` remains 1
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` is now 1
- `mat` remains a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`

State: **`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**
