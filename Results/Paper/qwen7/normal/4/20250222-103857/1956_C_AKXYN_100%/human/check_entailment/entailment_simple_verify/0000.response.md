### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of the sequence from 1 to `n`. This is done using the line `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]`.
   - This initialization is correct according to the problem statement, as it sets each row to a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum `res` using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This calculation seems to be an attempt to compute a specific value, but it does not directly relate to the sum of the matrix elements after the operations. Instead, it calculates a value that is not relevant to the problem's objective.

3. **Operations Execution**:
   - The program prints `n << 1` (which is `2n`) as the number of operations, indicating that it will perform 2n operations.
   - It then prints `n` operations of type 1 and `n` operations of type 2, each setting each row and each column to the same permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations as required.
   - However, the operations printed do not reflect the actual operations needed to maximize the sum of the matrix. The program simply sets each row and each column to the same permutation, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.

5. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem allows for two types of operations: row operations and column operations. The program only performs row operations, which is insufficient to achieve the maximum sum in all cases.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider a 2x2 matrix:
     ```
     1 2
     3 4
     ```
   - The program would perform:
     - Row operation: `1 2` → `2 1`
     - Column operation: `2 1` → `4 3`
   - Resulting matrix:
     ```
     4 3
     2 1
     ```
   - Sum: `4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10`
   - However, the optimal solution would be:
     - Row operation: `1 2` → `2 1`
     - Column operation: `2 1` → `4 3`
   - Resulting matrix:
     ```
     4 3
     2 1
     ```
   - Sum: `4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10`

   While the resulting matrix is correct, the program does not achieve the maximum sum in all cases. For example, if the initial matrix is:
   ```
   1 2
   3 4
   ```
   - The program would set each row and column to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, resulting in:
     ```
     1 2
     3 4
     ```
   - Sum: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
   - However, the optimal solution would be:
     - Row operation: `1 2` → `2 1`
     - Column operation: `2 1` → `4 3`
   - Resulting matrix:
     ```
     4 3
     2 1
     ```
   - Sum: `4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10`

   In this case, the program achieves the correct sum, but it does not generalize to all cases where column operations are necessary.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement. It only performs row operations and does not consider column operations, which is necessary to achieve the maximum sum in some cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
