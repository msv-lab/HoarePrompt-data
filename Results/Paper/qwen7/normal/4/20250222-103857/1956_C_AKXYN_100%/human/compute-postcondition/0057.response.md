Output State: **`res` is 29, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**.

Explanation: The value of `res` was initially 11. The code updates `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is 3, we calculate `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` as follows: `(3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28`. Thus, `res` becomes `11 + 28 = 29`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `mat` remain unchanged.
