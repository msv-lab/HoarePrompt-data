### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i,j} \) in the matrix can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \).
   - Two types of operations are allowed:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix elements and prints the result along with the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - The sum of the matrix after initializing it with the sequence from 1 to \( n \) in each row is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i \times n) = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - This is indeed the maximum possible sum because each element can be at most \( n \).
   - The solution uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly by setting the single element to 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the solution sets each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \), which is a valid permutation and maximizes the sum.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is correct as it maximizes the sum of the matrix and uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the specified constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
