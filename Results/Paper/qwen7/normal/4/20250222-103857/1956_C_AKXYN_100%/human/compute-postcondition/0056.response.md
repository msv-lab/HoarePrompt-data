Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 2 + 3 * 3 = 11 (This value does not change within the loop and is not part of the loop head).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (This value does not change within the loop and is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (This value does not change within the loop and is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 2 (This value changes within the loop and is part of the loop head).
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n` (This value does not change within the loop and is not part of the loop head).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration when `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`res` is 11, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**
