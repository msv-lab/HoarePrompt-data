Based on the initial state provided:

- `removed_count` is `k`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `_` is 1.
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
- `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
- `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order.
- `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
- The condition `removed_count == favorite_count` is true.

The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given that the condition `removed_count == favorite_count` is true, it means that the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the sorted list `sorted_a` is equal to `k`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
