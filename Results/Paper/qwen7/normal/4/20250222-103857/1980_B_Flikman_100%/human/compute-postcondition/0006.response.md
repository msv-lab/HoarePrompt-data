Output State: **`removed_count` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count = 0` initializes the variable `removed_count` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
