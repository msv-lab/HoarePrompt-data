The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `removed_count` is increased by 1 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `i`, `k`, and `removed_count` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can still execute as long as `k` remains greater than 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1**
