Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.
- `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.

Given these conditions and the fact that `removed_count` is explicitly stated to be 0, we can deduce the following:

- Since `removed_count` is 0, `favorite_count` cannot be 0 because `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.
- Therefore, `favorite_count` must be the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`.

However, the specific value of `favorite_count` is not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement, as the statement itself does not reference any variables or objects but simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
