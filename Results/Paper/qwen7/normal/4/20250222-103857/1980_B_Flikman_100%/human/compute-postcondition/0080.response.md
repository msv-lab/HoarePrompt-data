Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `removed_count` is 1, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given that `removed_count` was initially not specified in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before this line of code was executed. After executing this line, `removed_count` becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `k`, and `sorted_a[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
