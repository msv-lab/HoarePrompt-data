Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` must be greater than 2.
   - If `sorted_a[3]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` becomes 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must still be greater than 4 (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `k-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `k` must be greater than 4.

5. **Consider the postcondition involving `removed_count`**:
   - The value of `removed_count` does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the condition `sorted_a[3] == favorite_value`. This condition is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `k` must be greater than 4**.
