Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is equal to the original value of `k` (which is greater than 1), `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value` otherwise `removed_count` remains unchanged, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. The current value of `removed_count` is equal to the current value of `favorite_count`**.
