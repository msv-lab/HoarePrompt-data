Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is set to an empty list, meaning no vertices have any neighbors yet. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the initial state of `u2vs` is updated to reflect that it now contains `n` empty lists.
