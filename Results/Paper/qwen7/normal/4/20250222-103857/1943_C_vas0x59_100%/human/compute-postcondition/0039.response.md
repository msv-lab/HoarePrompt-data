The `while True` loop does not have any conditions in the loop head, meaning there are no variables to check or adjust based on specific conditions. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the variables mentioned in the problem statement.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of it. The only way to proceed to the next iteration is to leave the current loop and re-enter it, which means the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is `previous[b]`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
