Output State: **`len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 5, `ops` contains the tuples (`c1`, 5) and (`c2`, 2)**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `i` is 4, so after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 5. The list `ops` initially contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 2)`, and after appending `(c1, 5)`, it now contains `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 2)`, and `(c1, 5)`. The condition and value of `len(path_ba) - ci1` remain unchanged as no operation affects it.
