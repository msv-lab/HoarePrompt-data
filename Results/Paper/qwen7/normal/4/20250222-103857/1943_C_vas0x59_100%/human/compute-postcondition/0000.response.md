Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^3\) and `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree is still valid.
