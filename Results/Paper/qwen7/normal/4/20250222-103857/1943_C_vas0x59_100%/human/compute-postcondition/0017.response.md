Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 4, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by 3, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u-2, v, u-1]`**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was one less than the integer from the input decreased by 2. After decrementing, `v` becomes one less than the integer from the input decreased by 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
