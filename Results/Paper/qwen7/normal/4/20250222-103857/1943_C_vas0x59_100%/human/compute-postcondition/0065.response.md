Output State: **`len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 2, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `i` is 1, so after the operation, `i` becomes 2. The initial value of `ops` is `(c1, 1)`, and after appending `(c2, i)`, it becomes `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 2)`. The condition and value of `len(path_ba) - ci1` remain unchanged as no operation affects it.
