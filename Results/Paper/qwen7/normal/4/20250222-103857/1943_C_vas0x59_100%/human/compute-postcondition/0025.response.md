Output State: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `n-1`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `n-2`, and `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(n-2)` to `u-1`.**

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
