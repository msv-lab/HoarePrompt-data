Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(ci + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
   - `ops` is a list containing two tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `ci`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.

5. **Check the condition for `ci`**:
   - `ci` remains unchanged because it is derived from `len(path_ba) // 2` and does not change within the loop.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `ci` remains `len(path_ba) // 2`.
   - `ops` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`**
