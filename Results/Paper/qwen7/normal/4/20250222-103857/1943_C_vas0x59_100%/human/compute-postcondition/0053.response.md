Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains one tuple `(c, 0)`. After executing `ops.append((c, i))`, `ops` now contains two tuples: `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
