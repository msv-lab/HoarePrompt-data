Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u-1, v, u]`**.

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Initially, `u` was an integer from the input decreased by 2. After decrementing `u` by 1, `u` becomes an integer from the input decreased by 3. The values of `n`, `v`, and `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
