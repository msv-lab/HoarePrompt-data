Output State: **`len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 9, `ops` is a list containing two tuples \([(c1, 9), (c2, 9)]\)**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains one tuple `(c1, 9)`. After executing the code, `ops` will contain two tuples: `(c1, 9)` and `(c2, 9)`. The values of `len(path_ba) - ci1`, `i`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
