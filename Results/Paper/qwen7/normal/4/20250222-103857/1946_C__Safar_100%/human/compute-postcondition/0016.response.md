Output State: **`stack` is either `[(1, 1), (new_node, 1), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`, `x` is one of the neighbors of `1`, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices (must contain at least one element for key 1), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), `visited` is a set containing `1`, `d` is a dictionary with key `(1)` and value `1`, `r` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends a new tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack`. Since `stack` originally contained either `[(1, 1), (new_node, 1)]` or `[(1, 1)]`, after appending `(node, x)`, the updated `stack` will be either `[(1, 1), (new_node, 1), (node, x)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
