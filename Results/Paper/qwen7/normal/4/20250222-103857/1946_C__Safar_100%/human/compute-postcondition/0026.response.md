Output State: **`stack` is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ k < n - 1; `visited` is a set containing the element 1; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. All the variables retain their initial states, and the `break` statement is noted as the action taken.
