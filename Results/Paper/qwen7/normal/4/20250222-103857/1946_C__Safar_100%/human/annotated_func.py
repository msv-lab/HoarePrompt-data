#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: All edges in the `edges` list have been processed, and for each edge (a, b), both `g[a]` and `g[b]` include the other vertex.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `c` is 0, `l` is greater than `r`, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value before the loop terminated.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop terminates, the condition `l > r` must hold true because the loop continues as long as `l <= r`. The variable `c` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `mid` will be the last midpoint value calculated just before the loop's termination condition (`l > r`) was met.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in the tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, then performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`.
