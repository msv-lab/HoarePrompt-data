Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, and `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it is part of an implicit loop or condition. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that the program exits the relevant loop or condition.
