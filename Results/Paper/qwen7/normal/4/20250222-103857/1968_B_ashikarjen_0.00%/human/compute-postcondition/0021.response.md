Postcondition: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `j` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has either completed all iterations without finding a match between `b[i]` and `a[i]` for any `i`, or it has found a match but continued to iterate until `j` equals `m`. Additionally, `m` remains greater than 0, and no character in `b` up to index `m-1` matches the corresponding character in `a`.
