Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, and `m` is greater than 0, and the condition `j < m` is true; variable `k` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Since `j` is equal to `m` and `m` is greater than 0 with the condition `j < m` being true, these conditions remain valid post-execution. The only change is that `k` has been incremented by 1.
