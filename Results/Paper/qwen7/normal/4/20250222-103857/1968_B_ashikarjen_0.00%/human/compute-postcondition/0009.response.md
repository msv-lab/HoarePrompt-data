Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and `b[j]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 1
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[i]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `j` must be less than `m`
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented (i.e., `j` should become 2). Additionally, `m` must still be greater than `j` (which is now 2), and `b[j]` (which is `b[2]`) must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `j` and `m` to ensure the loop condition is satisfied.

**State:**
- `j` must be 2
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`

So, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
