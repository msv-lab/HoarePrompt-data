Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside.
