Postcondition: **`j` is equal to `m`, and `m` is greater than 0. If `j` did not reach `m` through the loop, then `b[j]` must have become equal to `a[i]` at some point, or `j` reached `m` without finding a match. In either case, the final state is `j` being equal to `m` and `m` remaining greater than 0.**
