Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, and `m` is greater than `0`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Since the loop condition `j < m` must eventually fail (because `j` will eventually become equal to `m`), and the loop will terminate when either `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` becomes equal to `a[i]`, the final state of `j` will be equal to `m`. The value of `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
