Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to `m` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- For every index `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, `b[i]` does not match `a[i]` unless `j` was incremented to `m` before the comparison could be made.
- The variable `k` contains the count of matches found during the loop's execution.

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the conditions:

1. Since `j` equals `m` and `m` is greater than 0, it implies that `j` is also greater than 0.
2. The loop iterates over indices from `0` to `n-1` and checks if `b[i]` matches `a[i]`. If `b[i]` does not match `a[i]`, it means no matches were found for those indices.
3. The only scenario where a match would be counted is if `j` was incremented to `m` before the comparison could be made. However, since `j` is equal to `m` at the end of the loop, this implies that `j` was incremented to `m` for all comparisons, meaning there were no matches found during the loop's execution.

Therefore, `k` must be 0 because no matches were found.

Output: **0**
