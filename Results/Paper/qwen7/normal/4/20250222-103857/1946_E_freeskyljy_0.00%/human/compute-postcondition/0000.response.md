Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `N, M1, M2 = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The variable `t` is not affected by this operation, so it remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
