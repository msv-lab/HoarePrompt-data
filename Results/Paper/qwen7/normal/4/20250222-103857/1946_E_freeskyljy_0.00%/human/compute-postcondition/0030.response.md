Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially defined as `L[-1] - 2`, after decrementing, its new value becomes `L[-1] - 3`. The values of all other variables (`t`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `cur`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
