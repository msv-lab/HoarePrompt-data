Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD`, `cur` is `R[0] + 1`, `nums_left` is \(N - R[0] - 1\), and `M2` is greater than 1, and the index `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` and then taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
