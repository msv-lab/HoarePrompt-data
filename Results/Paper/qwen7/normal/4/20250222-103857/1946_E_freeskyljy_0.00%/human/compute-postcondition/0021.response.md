Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is M1 - 2, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, `M1` is greater than 1, and either `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left = L[-1] - 2` assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to the variable `nums_left`. Since `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `nums_left` becomes `R[0] - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
