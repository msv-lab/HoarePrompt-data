Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is equal to `i + 2`, `i` is less than `N`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `nums_left` is decreased by 1, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`. After executing `cur += 1`, `nums_left` is decreased by another 1, making it decreased by 2 in total. Similarly, `i` is updated to `i + 1` and then incremented by 1 again, making it equal to `i + 2`. The condition `i` is less than `N` remains valid as long as `N` is greater than `i + 2`.
