Output State: **`ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2 or greater, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by multiplying its current value by `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `nums_left` also remains unchanged as it is not reassigned but used in the calculation.
