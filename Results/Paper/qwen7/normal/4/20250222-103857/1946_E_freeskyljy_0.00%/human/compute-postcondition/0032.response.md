Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`
   - `i` is decreased by 1

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue if `i > 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been decreased by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.

Given that `i` has been decreased by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`. Since `i` was decreased by 1, `i_new = i - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i_new` must be greater than 1, i.e., `i - 1 > 1` or `i > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it is greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The initial value of `i` must have been such that after decrementing it by 1, it is greater than 2.
   - Hence, `i` must be greater than 3 at the start of this iteration.

The final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `i` must be greater than 3**
