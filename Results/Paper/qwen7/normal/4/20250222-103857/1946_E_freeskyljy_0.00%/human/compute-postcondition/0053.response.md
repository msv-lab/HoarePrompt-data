Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is `R[0] + 1`, `nums_left` is N - R[0] - 1, and `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = R[0] + 1` assigns the value of `R[0] + 1` to the variable `i`. However, since the variable name is `cur` in the output state and not `i`, it updates `cur` to `R[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
