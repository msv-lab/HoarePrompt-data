Output State: **`nums_left` is \(N - R[0] - 2\)**.

Explanation: The variable `nums_left` is initially defined as \(N - R[0] - 1\). The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `nums_left` is \(N - R[0] - 2\). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
