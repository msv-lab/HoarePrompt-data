Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is now M1 - 3, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, `M1` is greater than 1, and either `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `N` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `i` is equal to `L[cur]`.**

Explanation: The code `cur -= 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was `M1 - 2`. After executing the code, `cur` becomes `M1 - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
