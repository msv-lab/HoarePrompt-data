Reasoning:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Initial Conditions Check**: The initial conditions check is too restrictive and does not cover all necessary constraints. It only checks if the last prefix maximum index is equal to the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the first suffix maximum index is `n`. This is insufficient to ensure the correctness of the permutation.

2. **Combination Calculation**: The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is used without considering the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums correctly. This calculation alone does not account for the relative positions of the maximums in the permutation.

3. **Loop Logic**: The logic in the loops is flawed. The loops do not correctly handle the relative positions of the prefix and suffix maximums. Specifically, the logic for updating `ans` and `nums_left` is not aligned with the requirements of the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when there are multiple prefix or suffix maximums that need to be considered in a more complex manner.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
