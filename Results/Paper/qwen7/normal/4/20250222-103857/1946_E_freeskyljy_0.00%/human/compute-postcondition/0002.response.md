Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `R`. The initial state of `t` and `L` remains unchanged, but now `R` holds the integers from the input.
