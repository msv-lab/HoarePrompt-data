Output State: **The program returns ans, which is the final computed value based on the loop operations.**

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `L` is a list of integers
- `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces
- `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop operations
- `cur` is \(M1 - 2\)
- `nums_left` is 0
- Either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`

The provided code snippet simply returns `ans`. Since no further operations are performed on `ans` within the given code, the value of `ans` remains as the final computed value from the loop operations. Therefore, the program returns `ans`, which is the final computed value based on the loop operations.
