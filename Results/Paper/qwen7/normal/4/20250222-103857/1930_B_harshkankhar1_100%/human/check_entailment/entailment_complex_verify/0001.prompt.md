You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: the elements of the list `a` with every second element starting from the first reversed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) and an integer \( n \). It then creates a list of integers from 1 to \( t \), reverses every second element starting from the first, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list based on the input parameters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to generate the permutation.
   - It creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It reverses every other element in the list starting from index 0 (i.e., elements at even indices).
   - Finally, it prints the generated list.

3. **Checking the Permutation:**
   - We need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition: there should not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

### Verification

#### Example Test Case: `n = 4`
- Input: `4`
- Generated permutation: `[4, 2, 3, 1]`
- Check pairs:
  - \(p_1 = 4\), \(p_2 = 2\): 4 does not divide 2.
  - \(p_2 = 2\), \(p_3 = 3\): 2 does not divide 3.
  - \(p_3 = 3\), \(p_4 = 1\): 3 does not divide 1.
  - \(p_1 = 4\), \(p_3 = 3\): 4 does not divide 3.
  - \(p_2 = 2\), \(p_4 = 1\): 2 does not divide 1.
  - \(p_1 = 4\), \(p_4 = 1\): 4 does not divide 1.
- All conditions are satisfied.

#### Example Test Case: `n = 3`
- Input: `3`
- Generated permutation: `[3, 1, 2]`
- Check pairs:
  - \(p_1 = 3\), \(p_2 = 1\): 3 does not divide 1.
  - \(p_2 = 1\), \(p_3 = 2\): 1 does not divide 2.
  - \(p_1 = 3\), \(p_3 = 2\): 3 does not divide 2.
- All conditions are satisfied.

### Conclusion

The program generates a permutation by reversing every other element in the sequence from 1 to `n`. This approach ensures that no two adjacent elements have a divisibility relationship as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the generated permutations satisfy the given conditions.
