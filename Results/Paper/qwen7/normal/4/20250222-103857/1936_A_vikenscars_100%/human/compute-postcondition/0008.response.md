Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (since the loop starts at `1` and goes up to but does not include `n`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`, and `n` is greater than `1` and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `2`.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same: it must be greater than `1` and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

4. **Update the states:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition \(1 < n \leq 10^4\).

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - The postcondition for the next iteration is that `i` is `2` and `n` is still greater than `1` and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `max_item_idx` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`, which is less than.**
