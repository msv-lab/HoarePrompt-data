Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`**

Explanation: The code `max_item_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `max_item_idx`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
