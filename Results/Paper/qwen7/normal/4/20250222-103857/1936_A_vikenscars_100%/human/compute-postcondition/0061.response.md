Output State: **max_item_idx is 3, pair_idx is 2, i is 3, ans1 is the return value of func_1(3, 2, 3, 3), and ans2 is the return value of func_1(2, 2, 2, 2).**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`), the final state of `pair_idx` is determined based on the conditions within the loop. The loop iterates through each index from 0 to `n-1`, updating `pair_idx` according to the return values of `func_1`. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `pair_idx` was updated to 2 by the third iteration. Since there are no further changes to `pair_idx` in subsequent iterations based on the provided information, `pair_idx` remains 2 after all iterations. The other variables retain their last known values from the loop's final iteration.
