Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans1` by calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx (3)`, `pair_idx (1)`, `max_item_idx (3)`, and `i (2)`. Since the exact return value of `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, `ans1` is left as the return value of this function call. The other variables remain unchanged.
