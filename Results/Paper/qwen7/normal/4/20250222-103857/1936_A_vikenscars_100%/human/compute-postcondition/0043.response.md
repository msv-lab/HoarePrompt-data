Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**

Explanation: The line `pair_idx = i` updates the value of `pair_idx` to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
