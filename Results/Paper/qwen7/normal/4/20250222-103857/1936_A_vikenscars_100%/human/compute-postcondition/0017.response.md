Postcondition: `max_item_idx` is 3, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`, because if `ans` equals '<', then `max_item_idx` remains 3. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition does not change regardless of the value of `ans`.
