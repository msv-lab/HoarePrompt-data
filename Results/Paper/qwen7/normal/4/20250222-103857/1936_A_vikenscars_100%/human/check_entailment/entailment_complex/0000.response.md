### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a permutation \(p\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. We can query the interactor using the bitwise OR operation on pairs of indices and compare the results.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(a, b, c, d)`**: This function sends a query to the interactor with indices \(a, b, c, d\) and returns the result of the comparison between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
     - First, it sets `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\). For each index \(i\), it compares \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{max\_item\_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\). If the latter is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
     - Then, it sets `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx` and iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\). For each index \(i\), it compares \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\). If the former is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\). If they are equal, it further checks \((p_{pair\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) and updates `pair_idx` if necessary.
     - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initial Setup**: The function correctly initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through indices to find the index with the highest \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - **Pair Selection**: The function then selects the best possible pair by comparing \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\) for all \(i\). This ensures that the pair selected has the highest possible bitwise OR value.
   - **Max XOR Calculation**: Given that the bitwise OR operation is used to select the indices, and the final pair is chosen based on the highest possible OR value, the function should correctly identify the pair with the maximum XOR value.

4. **Query Limit**: The function makes at most \(3n\) queries, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Output Format**: The function prints the indices in the required format `! i j`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using the allowed number of queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
