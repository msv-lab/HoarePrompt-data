Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array, which does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The optimal arrangement would typically place the largest element at one end and the smallest at the other, alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Given the execution summary, the program sorts the array but does not compute the required beauty. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
