Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input. This means if the input integer is, for example, `5`, then `ar` would be `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']` if the integers were sorted in ascending order.
2. The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the list `ar` with a space character as the separator.
3. Therefore, `' '.join(ar)` will result in a single string where the elements of `ar` are concatenated with spaces in between.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `ar`. However, we know that `ar` contains the sorted integers from `1` to `n` as strings.

Output: **'1 2 3 ... n' (where n is the input integer and ar is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from 1 to n)**
