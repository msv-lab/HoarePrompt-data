Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the provided code simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array. This does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in such a way that the largest difference between consecutive elements is maximized. One effective strategy is to alternate the largest and smallest elements. Here's how the correct approach would work:

1. Sort the array.
2. Rearrange the array to alternate the largest and smallest elements (e.g., if sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\), the new arrangement could be \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, \ldots]\)).

Let's modify the function to implement this logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        ar.sort()
        
        # Initialize the result
        beauty = 0
        
        # Calculate the beauty by alternating the largest and smallest elements
        for i in range(n // 2):
            beauty += ar[n - 1 - i] - ar[i]
        
        if n % 2 != 0:
            # If the array has an odd number of elements, add the middle element once
            beauty += ar[n // 2]
        
        print(beauty)
```

With this corrected logic, the program will now correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
