Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range.
   - `int(input())`: This is the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Since `_` is a placeholder, it does not change within the loop.
   - The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - After each iteration, the value of `int(input())` decreases by 1 because it is used to define the range.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. Thus, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
