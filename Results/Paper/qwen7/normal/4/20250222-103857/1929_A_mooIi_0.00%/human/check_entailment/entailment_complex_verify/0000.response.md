### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. Let's break down the issues and verify the solution step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) of the array and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array and converts the sorted integers to strings.
   - It then joins these strings and prints the result.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program sorts the array but does not rearrange it to maximize the beauty.
   - The sorted array is converted to strings and printed, which does not help in calculating the beauty.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     3
     100 54 80
     ```
   - The program sorts the array \([100, 54, 80]\) to get \([54, 80, 100]\).
   - It converts this to strings and prints `['54', '80', '100']`.
   - This does not maximize the beauty because the correct arrangement to maximize the beauty would be \([54, 80, 100]\), giving a beauty of \( (80 - 54) + (100 - 80) = 26 \).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest difference is between the smallest and largest elements.
   - One optimal arrangement is to place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, with the rest in any order in between.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - Read the input as before.
   - Find the minimum and maximum values in the array.
   - Place the minimum value at the start and the maximum value at the end.
   - Sort the remaining elements in ascending order.
   - Calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
