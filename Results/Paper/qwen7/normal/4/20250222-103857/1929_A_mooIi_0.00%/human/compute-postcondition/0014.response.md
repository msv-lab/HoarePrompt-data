Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of t and the list of integers.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t and a list of n integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to the values of t and the list of integers provided for each test case.
