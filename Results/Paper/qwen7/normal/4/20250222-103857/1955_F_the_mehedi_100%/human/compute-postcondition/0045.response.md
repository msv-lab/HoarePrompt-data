Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it also accepts a list `p_i` containing four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that 0 ≤ p_i[0] + p_i[1] + p_i[2] + p_i[3] ≤ 200. The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes a list `p_i` with counts of different numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s). The function then performs some operation based on these counts and returns the result accordingly.
