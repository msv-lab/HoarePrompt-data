Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - The variable `x` is being iterated over each element in the list `a`.
   - The variable `cnt` is being updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to it.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the list `a` that has not been processed yet.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
   - We need to determine what `x` was in the previous iteration to update `cnt`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` is being iterated over from the list `a`, we need to know the value of `x` from the previous iteration to update `cnt`.
   - Let's assume `x` was the last element processed in the previous iteration (since the exact value of `x` is not given, we can't specify it precisely).

6. **Update the state**:
   - `cnt` is now increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `x` and the updated `cnt`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` where `x` is the next element in the list `a`, and `a` must still contain elements**. 

Since we don't know the exact value of `x` from the previous iteration, we can represent it as the next element in the list `a`.

If we had the exact value of `x` from the previous iteration, we would include that value explicitly. But without that information, we can only say that `x` is the next element in the list `a`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` where `x` is the next element in the list `a`, and `a` must still contain elements**.
