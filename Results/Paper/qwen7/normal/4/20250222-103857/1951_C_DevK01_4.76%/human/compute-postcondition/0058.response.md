To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is `t_prev - 1`
   - `n` is the length of `N`
   - `m` is the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`
   - `k` is `L[2]`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part)
   - `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers

2. **Conditions and calculations:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
   - Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`

Given these steps, we need to determine the value of `cost` based on the conditions provided. Since the exact values of `t_prev`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `q`, and the input are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, we can describe it based on the formula provided.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions: if n * m == k, then cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2); otherwise, cost = cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu)**
