Output State: **`t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `m` is updated to the minimum value between `m` and `k`; cost is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

This output state reflects that the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `M`, `q`, `N`, and `L` retain their previous values, while a new variable `cost` is introduced and calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
