Output State: **`t` is `t_prev - 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part), `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and the input is split and converted to integers and stored in `L`.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `M`. This updates the value of `M` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `N`, or `L`. The other variables remain unchanged.
