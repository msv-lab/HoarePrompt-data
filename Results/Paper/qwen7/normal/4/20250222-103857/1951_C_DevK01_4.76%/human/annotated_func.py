#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, and the final state of the variables is as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` after performing certain operations like sorting the list `M`, splitting it into smaller segments, and computing sums and products of its elements. Finally, it prints the calculated cost for each test case.
