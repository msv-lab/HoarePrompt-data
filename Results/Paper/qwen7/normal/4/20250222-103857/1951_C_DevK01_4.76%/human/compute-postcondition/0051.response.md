Output State: **`t` is `t_prev - 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` remains the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part), `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. It does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `M`, `q`, `N`, and `L` remain unchanged. The new variable `cost` is introduced with the calculated value.
