Output State: **`t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is now the length of `N`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
