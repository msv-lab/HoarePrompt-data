Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `n` is the length of these elements. The value of `cost` is computed and stored in the variable `cost`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
