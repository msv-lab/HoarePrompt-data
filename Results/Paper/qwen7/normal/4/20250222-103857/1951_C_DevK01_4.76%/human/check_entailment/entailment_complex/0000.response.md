Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list `a` representing the ticket prices for each day.
3. It ensures that `m` does not exceed `k` and sorts the list `M` (which should be `a`).
4. It calculates the number of days required to buy `k` tickets (`q`), which is the ceiling of `k/m`.
5. It splits the list `a` into the first `q` elements, `N`, and then processes these elements to calculate the total cost.
6. The logic for calculating the cost is correct:
   - If `n * m == k`, it calculates the cost directly.
   - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets by adjusting the cost calculation.
7. The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and matches the requirements. Therefore, the program should work correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
