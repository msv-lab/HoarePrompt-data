Output State: **`i` is 3; `x` must be greater than 1; `next_elem` is `a[4 % x] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[4 % x]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_elem` based on the conditions given. Since `i` is 3, the condition `i == x - 1` would only be true if `x` is 4. However, since the initial state specifies that `x` must be greater than 1, `x` could be any value greater than 1. The expression for `next_elem` is defined as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`. Given `i` is 3, this simplifies to `a[4 % x] + n` if `x` is 4, otherwise it simplifies to `a[4 % x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
