Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is 1; `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n and is not in present; `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in present.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, so `ans` becomes 1. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `t1` and `t2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
