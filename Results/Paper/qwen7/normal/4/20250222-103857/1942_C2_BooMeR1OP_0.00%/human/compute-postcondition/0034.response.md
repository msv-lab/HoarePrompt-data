Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `gap` is appended to the list `gaps`.**

The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Since the initial value of `gap` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged and is added to the list `gaps`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
