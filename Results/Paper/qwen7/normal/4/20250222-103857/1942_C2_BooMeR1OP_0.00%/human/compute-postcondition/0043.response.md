Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` must be greater than 1.
   - `next_elem` is `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`.
   - `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `x` remains the same (must be greater than 1).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 1**
