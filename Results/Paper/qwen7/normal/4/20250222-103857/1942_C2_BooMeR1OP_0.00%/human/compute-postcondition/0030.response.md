Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it must be greater than 0. The variable `next_elem` is calculated based on the expression `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`. Since `i` is now 1, the expression simplifies to `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`.
