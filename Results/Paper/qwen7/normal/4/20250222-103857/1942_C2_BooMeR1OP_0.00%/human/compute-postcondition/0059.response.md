Postcondition: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented either by `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`) or by 2 times the value of `y` (if `y` is less than `pairs`), `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `y` is less than `pairs`.
