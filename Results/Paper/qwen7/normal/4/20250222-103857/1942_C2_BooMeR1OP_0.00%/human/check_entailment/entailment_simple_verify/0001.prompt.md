You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration starting from 0. The loop continues until `i` reaches `x`.

Since the problem statement indicates that the loop updates `ans` to `x` if these conditions are satisfied for all `i` from 0 to `x-1`, `ans` will be equal to `x`. The values of `t1` and `t2` will be the results of `(a[i] + 1) % n` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` respectively, with `i` being the last value it takes, which is `x-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `ans` to `x - 2` because initially, the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices is `x - 2`.
   - It converts the chosen vertices to zero-based indexing (`a = [num - 1 for num in a]`).
   - It sorts the chosen vertices (`a.sort()`).

3. **Counting Initial Triangles:**
   - It iterates through the chosen vertices and checks if adding the next two consecutive vertices (considering the circular nature of the polygon) would form an additional triangle. If so, it increments `ans`.

4. **Finding Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - It calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices (including wrapping around the polygon).
   - These gaps are sorted to process them in increasing order.

5. **Maximizing Triangles Using Additional Vertices:**
   - It iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to use the available `y` additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates how many pairs of vertices can be added within the gap.
   - If there are enough additional vertices to cover all pairs, it adds the full gap to `ans` and reduces `y`.
   - If not, it adds twice the number of available vertices and breaks the loop.

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the maximum number of triangles `ans`.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Initial Triangle Count:**
   - The initial count of triangles (`x - 2`) is correct since any set of three vertices forms a triangle.

2. **Adding Consecutive Vertices:**
   - The logic to check and add triangles using consecutive vertices is correct.

3. **Gaps Calculation and Processing:**
   - The gaps are correctly calculated and processed in increasing order.
   - The logic to use additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles is sound.

4. **Handling Remaining Gaps:**
   - The program correctly handles the remaining gaps by adding twice the number of available vertices when not enough vertices are left.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake by considering the constraints and processing the gaps efficiently.
