Postcondition: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by either the value of `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`) or increased by 2 times the value of `y` (if `y` is less than `pairs`), `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is adjusted accordingly. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, `ans` is incremented by `gap`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`.**
