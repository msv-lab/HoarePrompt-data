Postcondition: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` retains its initial value, `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is less than `pairs`**
