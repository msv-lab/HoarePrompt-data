Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `x-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` must be greater than 1.
   - `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`.
   - `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - If `gap > 0`, `gap` is appended to the list `gaps`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will increment `i` to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < x`. Given that `x` must be greater than 1, and `i` is now 1, the loop will execute again as long as `x` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `x` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
   - `next_elem` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (which is 2), but since the calculation depends on `x` and `n`, and `x` is unchanged, `next_elem` remains the same unless `x` changes.
   - `gap` will be recalculated using the new value of `i` (which is 2).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`. The other states (`next_elem` and `gap`) will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**.
