Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to use bitwise operations to group numbers based on their 31 least significant bits but does not fully address the requirement that any two numbers in the same group must differ in every bit position from 1 to 31.

To solve this problem correctly, you should consider the numbers in their 31-bit representation and ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit pattern across all 31 bits. A more appropriate approach would involve using a bitmask to represent the bit patterns and tracking these patterns to determine the minimum number of groups needed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create a set to track unique bit patterns
    bit_patterns = set()
    
    for num in a:
        # Create a bitmask representing the 31 least significant bits
        bitmask = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        # Add the bitmask to the set; duplicates will not be added
        bit_patterns.add(bitmask)
    
    # The size of the set gives the minimum number of groups needed
    print(len(bit_patterns))
```

This corrected program uses a set to track unique 31-bit representations of the numbers. Since sets automatically handle duplicates, the size of the set directly corresponds to the minimum number of groups required.
