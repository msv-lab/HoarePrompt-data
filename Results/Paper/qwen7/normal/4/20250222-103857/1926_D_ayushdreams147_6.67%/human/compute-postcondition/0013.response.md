Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num`, which is being iterated over from the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**:
   - `num` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - If `num` is not in `count`, `res` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - If `num` is not in `count`, `res` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of the list `a`, the next element in the list `a` will be the second element.
   - The variable `num` will now be set to the second element of the list `a`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty list but now `num` is the second element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the second element of the list `a`**.
