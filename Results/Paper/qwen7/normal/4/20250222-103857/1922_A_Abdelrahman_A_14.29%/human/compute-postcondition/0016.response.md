Output State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is a value that is not present in list a and not present in list b, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `c`, `x`, and `no`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
