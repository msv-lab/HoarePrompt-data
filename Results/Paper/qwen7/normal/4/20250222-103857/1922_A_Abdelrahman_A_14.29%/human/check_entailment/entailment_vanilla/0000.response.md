### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length Handling**: It correctly reads the length of the strings (`slength`).
3. **Initial Checks**: The initial checks to determine if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b` are correct. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, it prints "NO" immediately, which is correct because `c` cannot match the same template that `a` and `b` do.
4. **Character Check Loop**: The loop that checks each character in `c` to see if it appears in both `a` and `b` is almost correct but has a flaw. The current implementation will print "YES" as soon as it finds a character in `c` that is not in both `a` and `b`. However, this logic is flawed because it should check if every character in `c` either matches the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (if the template allows it) or does not match (if the template disallows it). The current logic only checks if the character is present in both `a` and `b`, which is not sufficient.
5. **Final Check**: The final check ensures that if no valid template is found, it prints "NO", which is correct.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not entirely correct because it does not properly handle the template matching logic. Specifically, the loop that checks each character in `c` should ensure that the character either matches the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (if the template allows it) or does not match (if the template disallows it).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
