Postcondition: `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`, `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`, `i` is 1. If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.
