Postcondition: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`, `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`, `i` is 2. If `x[2] < y[2]`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and `y`.**
