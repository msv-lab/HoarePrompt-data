Output State: `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`; `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`; `i` is `9` (since the loop runs from `0` to `9`, inclusive, making `10` iterations in total).

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` and `y` will each contain 10 elements, corresponding to the first and second elements of each input pair provided through the loop's iterations, respectively.
