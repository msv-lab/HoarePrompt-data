Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`; `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`; `i` is 9 (since the loop runs from 0 to 9, inclusive).**

This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, `x` will contain 10 elements, each being the first integer from each line of input split by the `input().split(' ')` operation. Similarly, `y` will also contain 10 elements, each being the second integer from each line of input. The variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, will be 9 after the last iteration.
