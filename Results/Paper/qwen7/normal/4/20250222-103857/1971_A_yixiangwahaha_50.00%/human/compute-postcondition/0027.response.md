Based on the initial state provided:

- `xylist` is a list of strings, where each string is split into two elements (x and y coordinates).
- `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`.
- `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`.
- `i` is set to 1.

The `print(x[i], ' ', y[i])` statement will access the elements at index `i` in the lists `x` and `y`. Since `i` is 1, it will print the second element of both `x` and `y`.

Output: **x[1] y[1]**
