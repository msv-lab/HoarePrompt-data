You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`; `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`; `i` is 9 (since the loop runs from 0 to 9, inclusive).
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all 10 iterations. The variable `i` is now 10. For each iteration, the code compared the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` and printed either `x[i]` followed by `y[i]` or `y[i]` followed by `x[i]` based on which value was smaller. After all iterations, the lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged because the loop only prints values and does not modify `x` or `y`. The `xylist` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined conditions involving an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and integers x and y (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
