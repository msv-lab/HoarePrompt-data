Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is the list `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it; `i` is `k + 1` and the first element of `x` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` appends the first element of `xylist`, which is converted to an integer, to the list `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the first element of `x` is now an integer, but the exact value is not specified since it depends on the input.
