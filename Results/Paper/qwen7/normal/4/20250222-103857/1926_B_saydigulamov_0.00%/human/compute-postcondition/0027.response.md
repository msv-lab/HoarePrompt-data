Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `k` is an empty list, and `b` is the last input string from the user containing the character '1'.**

The code `k = []` initializes `k` as an empty list. This affects only the variable `k`, making it an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
