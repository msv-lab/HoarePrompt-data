Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run based on the integer value entered by the user.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `a` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b` plus one.
   - `b` is updated to the input string from the user containing the character '1'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the user inputs an integer value (let's call it `num`) such that `num > 0`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
   - The variable `a` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - The variable `k` and `b` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - The key variable here is the input value that determines how many times the loop will run. Let's denote this input value as `num`.

Given the above points, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `num` (the input value) will determine how many times the loop will run. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will now be 2, and the loop will run again if `num` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` becomes 2.
- `k` and `b` remain unchanged.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b` plus one, and `b` is updated to the input string from the user containing the character '1'.**
