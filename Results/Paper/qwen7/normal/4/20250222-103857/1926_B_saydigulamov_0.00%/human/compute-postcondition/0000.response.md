Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 2 ≤ a ≤ 10.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which is constrained to be between 2 and 10. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was only specified to be between 1 and 100 without any specific value given initially.
