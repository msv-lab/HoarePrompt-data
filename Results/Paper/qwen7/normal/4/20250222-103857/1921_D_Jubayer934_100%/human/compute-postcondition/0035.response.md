Output State: `temp` must be less than `n - 1`, `i` must be equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `temp` will still be less than `n - 1` (since it's not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The list `ans` will contain all the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for each index from `0` to `n-1`, as the loop appends these differences to `ans` in each iteration.
