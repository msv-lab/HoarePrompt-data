Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(temp, n):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n-2`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.
   - `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n-2`, the loop will execute one more time if `i` becomes `n-1`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented from `n-2` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is now `n-1`, the condition `i < n` will still hold true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
   - `temp` must remain less than or equal to `n-1` for the loop to continue.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `temp` must still be less than or equal to `n-1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`**
