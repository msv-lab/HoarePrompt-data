Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that has appended the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional where `i` was being incremented and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` was being appended to the list `ans`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that the loop or conditional has been exited.
