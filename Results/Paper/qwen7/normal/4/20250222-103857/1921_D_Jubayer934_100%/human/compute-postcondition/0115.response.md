Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It validates that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values, and validate these values according to given constraints. It then processes these validated inputs and returns the appropriate results for each test case.
