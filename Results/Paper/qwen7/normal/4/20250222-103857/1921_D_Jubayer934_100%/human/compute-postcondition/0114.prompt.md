Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `-1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` up to the point where the condition in the loop was no longer met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`. If `temp` is less than or equal to `n-1` and has been decremented to its final value during the last iteration, then `i` equals `temp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
