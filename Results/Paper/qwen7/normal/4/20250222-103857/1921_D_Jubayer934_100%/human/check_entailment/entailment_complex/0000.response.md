Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. The arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Array `a` is sorted in ascending order, and array `b` is sorted in descending order.
4. The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted array `a` and tries to maximize the difference by comparing with the corresponding elements in the reversed sorted array `b`.
5. If the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met, it indicates that swapping the current element in `a` with the corresponding element in `b` from the end would yield a larger difference. The function then updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
6. If `temp` is not `-1`, it means a swap was made, and the function appends the differences using the adjusted indices.
7. Finally, it prints the sum of the differences for each test case.

Given the logic and steps, the function appears to correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference \(D\).

Correctness: **True**
