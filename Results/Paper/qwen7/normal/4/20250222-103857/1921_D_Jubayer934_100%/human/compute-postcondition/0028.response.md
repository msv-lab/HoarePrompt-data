Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of `i` and `temp`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is set to `n - 1`.
   - From the given state, `temp` is set to `n - 1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `for i in range(temp, n)`. This means the loop will start with `i = temp` and increment `i` until `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the Initial Values**:
   - If `temp` is equal to `n - 1`, then the loop will start with `i = n - 1` and will not enter the loop because `i` will never be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `temp` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `temp` is less than `n - 1` so that the loop can start with `i = temp` and continue executing.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, `ans`, and `n` should remain as they are since they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `temp` must be less than `n - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`temp` must be less than `n - 1`**
