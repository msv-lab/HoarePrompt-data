Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `temp` to `n-1`. This means `i` must be less than `n` and greater than or equal to `temp`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `temp` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `temp` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `temp + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `temp + 1` must be less than `n`, which implies `temp < n - 1` (which is already given).
   - The value of `ans` remains the same since it is not updated within the loop body.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `temp` remains the same as it is not updated in the loop.
   - `i` is now `temp + 1`.
   - `ans` still contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`temp` must be less than `n - 1`, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`**.
