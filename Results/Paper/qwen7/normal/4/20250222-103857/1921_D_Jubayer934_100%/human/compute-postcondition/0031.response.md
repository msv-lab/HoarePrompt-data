Output State: **`temp` must be less than `n - 1`; `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, and the initial values of `a` and `b` are not given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` after the operation. The only thing we know for sure is that `temp` must still be less than `n - 1`, and `ans` now includes the new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
