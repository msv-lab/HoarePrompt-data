Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `-1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` up to the point where the condition in the loop was no longer met.**
