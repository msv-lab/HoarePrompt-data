Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the same values of `i` and `n` are retained.
