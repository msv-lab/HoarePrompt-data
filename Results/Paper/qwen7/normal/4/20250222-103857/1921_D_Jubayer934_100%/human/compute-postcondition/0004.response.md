Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list of the first n integers from the sorted input, where each integer is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, sorts the resulting list, and then takes the first `n` elements from this sorted list. These elements are stored in the `ans` list. The values of `t`, `m`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
