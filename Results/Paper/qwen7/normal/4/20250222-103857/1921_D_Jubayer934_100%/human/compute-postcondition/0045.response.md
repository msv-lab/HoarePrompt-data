Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input with `n` being greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is such that the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
