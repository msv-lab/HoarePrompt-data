Output State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `temp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is already updated with this value, it means that the operation has been performed and the value has been added to `ans`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, `n`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
