Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of both lists, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element in `b` at the index `-(n - i)` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element in `b` at the index `i`.**
