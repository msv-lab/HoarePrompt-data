Output State: `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `-1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` up to the point where the condition in the loop was no longer met.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` has reached `-1`. The variable `temp` retains the value `n - 1` because the loop broke when `i` was `n - 1` during the third iteration. The list `ans` contains all the calculated absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop condition was no longer satisfied.
