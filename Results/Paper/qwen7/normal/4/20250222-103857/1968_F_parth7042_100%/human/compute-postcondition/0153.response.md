Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `results` is 'NO' because the value of `v1` does not change and `it1` remains the same.**

Explanation: The line `v1 = mp[pf[r]]` assigns the value of `mp[pf[r]]` to `v1`. This does not affect any other variables. Since no conditions or comparisons are made that could change the value of `results`, and given that the condition `x == 0` and the subsequent checks involving `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, and `v2` are not met (as no new information is introduced to satisfy these conditions), `results` remains 'NO'.
