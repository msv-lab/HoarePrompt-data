Output State: **`mp[0]` is now `[0]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `index` is now `x + n + 4`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2` are unchanged, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code `mp[0].append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `mp[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
