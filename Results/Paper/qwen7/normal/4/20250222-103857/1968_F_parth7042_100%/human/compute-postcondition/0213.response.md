Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `data[index + 4]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'NO']` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise `results` remains `['NO']`.**
