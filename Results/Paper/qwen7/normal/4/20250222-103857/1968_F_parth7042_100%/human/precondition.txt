t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, followed by n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, and then q pairs of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
