Output State: **`index` is 21, `q` is 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[18]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[19]`, `v1` is reassigned to `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` was `['NO']`. After appending, `results` becomes `['NO', 'NO']`. The values of the other variables (`index`, `q`, `x`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`) remain unchanged.
