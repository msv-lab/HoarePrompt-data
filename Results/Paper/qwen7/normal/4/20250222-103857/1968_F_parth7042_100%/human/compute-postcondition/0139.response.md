Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `it1` as the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
