Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is initially 2, `n` will be the integer value of `data[2]`. The other variables (`index`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
