Output State: **`i` is 2; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after the code execution, `i` becomes 2. The value of `pf[1]` is calculated as `pf[0] ^ a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `index` being increased by 1.
