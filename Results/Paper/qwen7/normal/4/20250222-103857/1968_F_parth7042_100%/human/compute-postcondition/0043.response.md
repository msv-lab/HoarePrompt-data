Output State: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, and `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`.**

The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` searches for the position in the list `v1` where the value `l` should be inserted to keep the list sorted. This position is stored in `it1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
