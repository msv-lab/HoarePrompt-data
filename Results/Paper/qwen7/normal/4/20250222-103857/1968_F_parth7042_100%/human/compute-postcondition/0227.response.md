The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables outside of a loop context.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`.**
