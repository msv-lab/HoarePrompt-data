Postcondition: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` is true, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` holds.**
