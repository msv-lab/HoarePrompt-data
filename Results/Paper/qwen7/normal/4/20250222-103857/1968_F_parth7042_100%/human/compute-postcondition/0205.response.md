Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` is `['YES']`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO']`.
