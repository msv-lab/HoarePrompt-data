Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. For each query defined by integers `l` and `r`, it returns a result based on the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r-1`.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts parameters through its environment (such as global variables or predefined inputs), processes these inputs, and for each query, it returns a result based on the specified subarray of the list `a`.
