Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `index` is now `x + n + 4`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2` are unchanged, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict with default value as list.**

Explanation: The line `mp = defaultdict(list)` creates a new dictionary-like object named `mp` where the default factory function is `list`. This means that when trying to access a key that does not exist in `mp`, it will automatically create a new list for that key. None of the other variables (`a`, `index`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `pf`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
