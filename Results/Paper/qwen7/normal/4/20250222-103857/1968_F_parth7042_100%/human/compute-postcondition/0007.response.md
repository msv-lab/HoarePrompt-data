Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`.**

Explanation: The code `q = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `q` by converting `data[index + 1]` to an integer. Given that `index` is initially 3, `index + 1` becomes 4. Therefore, `q` is assigned the integer value from `data[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
