Postcondition: `data` remains unchanged, `index` is incremented by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and if `x == 0`, `results` contains 'YES' and the loop continues; otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
