Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is 11, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length 7 with `a[11]` being an integer and the rest being 0, `pf` is a list of length 8 where each element is calculated as `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` starting from `pf[0] = 0`, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value `[0]`, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 11, `mp[pf[11]]` is appended with `11`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to `n + 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` must be 11 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration). Therefore, the loop will continue to run until `i` reaches `n + 1`. If `n` was set to 3 initially, after the loop completes, `i` would be 4 (as it starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`). However, based on the provided information, we can infer that `n` is at least 3, and after 3 iterations, `i` would be 4. But since the problem asks for the final state after all iterations, assuming the loop continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`, and given the last iteration mentioned is `i` being 11, we conclude that `n` must be 10. Thus, `index` will be `n + 1`, which is 11. All other variables' states remain as described after the third iteration, with `a[11]` being the next integer value from `data[index]`, and `mp[pf[11]]` being appended with `11`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` list contains 'YES' if `it1` is less than `len(v1)`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` list contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is 17, `q` is 3, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[15]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[17]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` is `['YES']`. Otherwise, `results` has `'NO'` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is 21, `q` is 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[18]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[19]`, `v1` is reassigned to `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'NO']` if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
