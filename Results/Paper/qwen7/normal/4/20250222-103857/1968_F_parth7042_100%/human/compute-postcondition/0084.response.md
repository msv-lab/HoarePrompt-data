Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `_`. This means the loop is iterating `t` times, but the loop itself does not change any variables inside the loop body. Therefore, no variables are modified within the loop.

2. **Determine Initial State**: The initial state at the start of the loop is given as follows:
   - `index` is 25
   - `q` is 1
   - `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`
   - `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`
   - `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`
   - `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`
   - `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`
   - `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`
   - `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`
   - `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'NO']` if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`

3. **Adjust States for Next Iteration**: Since the loop does not modify any variables, the values of all the variables remain the same from one iteration to the next. The only thing that changes is the iteration count, which is represented by the loop variable `_`.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` needs to be incremented by 1. However, since the loop counter is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, we assume it starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

Given the initial state and the fact that the loop does not modify any variables, the state remains the same for each iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`index` is 25, `q` is 1, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'NO']` if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`**
