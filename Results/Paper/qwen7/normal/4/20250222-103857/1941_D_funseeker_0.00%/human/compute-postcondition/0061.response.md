Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `temp` will be a set containing all unique elements added during each iteration based on the conditions specified by the value of `c`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `temp` will be a set that contains all the unique elements that were added to it during each iteration of the loop. The elements added to `temp` depend on the value of `c` as follows:
- If `c` is '1' or '?', the element `(q - r) % n` is added.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', the element `(q + r) % n` is added.
- If `c` is neither '1', '0', nor '?', no new elements are added to `temp`.

The final state of `temp` will include all such elements added throughout the iterations, ensuring that duplicates are not present due to the nature of sets. The other variables (`ans`, `r`, `c`, `m`) will retain their states from the last iteration of the loop, with `m` being `m - k` where `k` is the number of iterations performed.
