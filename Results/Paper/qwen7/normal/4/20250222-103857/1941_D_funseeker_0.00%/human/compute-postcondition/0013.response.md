Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; if `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains an element which is `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `ans` must contain at least one element and there is no change in `ans` if `c` is neither '1' nor '?', the only change is in `temp`. The value of `temp` now includes `(q - r) % n`. The conditions for `c` remain the same.
