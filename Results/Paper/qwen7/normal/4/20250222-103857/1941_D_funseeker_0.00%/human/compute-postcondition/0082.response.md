Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q + r) % n`, and now `temp` also contains an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. Since `q` is the next element in `ans` and `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, after executing the code, `temp` will have an additional element `(q - r) % n`. All other conditions remain the same.
