t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The list of throws is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a string c_i ('0', '1', or '?') indicating the direction of the throw.
