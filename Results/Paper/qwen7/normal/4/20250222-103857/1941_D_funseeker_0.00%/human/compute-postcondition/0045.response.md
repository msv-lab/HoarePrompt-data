Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing one or two elements depending on the value of `c`. Specifically, `temp` will contain `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` will have one or two elements as described, and `m` is `m - 1`.
