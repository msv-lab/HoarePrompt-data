Output State: **`ans` is equal to `temp`, which contains all unique elements added during each iteration based on the conditions specified by the value of `c`.**

This means that after executing the line `ans = temp`, the variable `ans` now holds the same set of values that `temp` contained, which is a set of all unique elements added during each iteration based on the conditions specified by the value of `c`. The initial conditions and the nature of `temp` remain unchanged.
