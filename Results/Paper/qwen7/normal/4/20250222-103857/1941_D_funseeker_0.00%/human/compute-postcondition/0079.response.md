Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp` which is the result of `(q + r) % n`. The values of `ans` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `temp` now includes the new element calculated from the given expression.
