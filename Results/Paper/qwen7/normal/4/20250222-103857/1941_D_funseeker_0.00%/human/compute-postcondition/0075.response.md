Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?', and `c` is '1' or '?' as per the if condition.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained one element `(q + r) % n`, after adding `(q - r) % n`, `temp` now contains two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
