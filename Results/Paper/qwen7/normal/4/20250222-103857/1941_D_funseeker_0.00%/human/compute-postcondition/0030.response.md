Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` is an empty list, `r` remains as the integer value converted from the original string `r`, `c` remains as the string `c`, and `temp` is a set containing elements that are either `(q - r) % n` or `(q + r) % n` based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `ans`. For each iteration, if `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. Since `ans` is iterated over completely, `ans` will eventually become an empty list. The values of `r` and `c` do not change within the loop. `temp` accumulates all valid additions based on the conditions given, resulting in a set of integers.
