Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `c` is a character.
- If `c` is '1', then `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` contains an additional element `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` is neither '1', '0', nor '?', then `temp` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for q in ans:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `q` is taken from the list `ans`.
- The loop does not modify `c`, `temp`, `r`, or `n` directly within its body; it only iterates over `q`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `q`, `ans`, `c`, `temp`, `r`, and `n`.
2. **Determine the Next Value of `q`**: Since `q` is taken from `ans`, the next value of `q` will be the next element in the list `ans`.
3. **Adjust the State**: The state of `c`, `temp`, `r`, and `n` should remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop only iterates over `q` and does not modify `c`, `temp`, `r`, or `n`, the state of these variables remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`c` is a character. If `c` is '1', then `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` contains an additional element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1', '0', nor '?', then `temp` remains unchanged.**

Note: The values of `q`, `r`, and `n` will change to the next element in `ans`, but since these changes are not specified in the problem, the state of `c` and `temp` remains unchanged.
