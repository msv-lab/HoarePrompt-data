### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: Reads a line from the standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function is used to read input lines in subsequent functions.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**: Calls `func_1` and converts the returned string to an integer. It processes a series of test cases, reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.

3. **Function `func_3`**: Calls `func_1` and splits the returned string into a list of integers. This function is used to parse the initial input for each test case (`n`, `m`, `x`).

4. **Function `func_4`**: 
   - Reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw, reading the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or '?' indicating both directions).
   - Updates the set `ans` with the potential new positions of the player holding the ball based on the direction.
   - Handles the special case where the position 0 is included in the set, replacing it with `n`.
   - Prints the number of possible final positions and the positions themselves.

Given the execution summaries and the problem description, the function `func_4` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately handles the input parsing, updates the set of possible positions based on the given directions, and outputs the correct results.

### Correctness:
**True**
