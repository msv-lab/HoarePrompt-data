Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element from `ans`, `temp` is unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?', and `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n` if `c` is either '0' or '?'.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` will always contain an element equal to `(q + r) % n`, while `q` remains the next element from `ans` and `temp` stays unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.
