Output State: **`s` is decreased by the last element of the list `elements`, and `i` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` from `s`. The index `-i` refers to the last element of the list regardless of the value of `i`. The value of `i` itself is not modified by this operation, so it remains unchanged.
