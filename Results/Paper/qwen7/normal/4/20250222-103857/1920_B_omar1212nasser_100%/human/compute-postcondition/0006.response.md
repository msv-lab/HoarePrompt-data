Output State: **`i` is 1; `removals` must be a positive integer; `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`; `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` from `s2`. Since `i` is initially 1, `elements[-i]` refers to `elements[-1]`. The other variables (`i`, `removals`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `s2` is updated by subtracting `elements[-1]` from its current value.
