Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.
   - Sorts the array `a`.
   - Calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to get the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - Prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Takes `removals` (maximum elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (maximum elements Bob can negate), and `elements` (the array).
   - Initializes `s` as the sum of all elements and `s2` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements.
   - Iterates from 1 to `removals`, updating `s` and `s2` by removing the largest elements.
   - Adjusts `s2` by adding the next smallest element when possible.
   - Stores the calculated values in `pos` as `s - 2 * s2`.
   - Returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows Alice to remove the smallest elements first, maximizing the sum.
- **Negation Strategy**: Bob can negate the smallest elements to minimize the sum. By iterating through the possible number of negations and removing elements, the function considers all optimal strategies.
- **Optimal Strategy**: The approach ensures that both players play optimally by considering all possible combinations of removals and negations.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided functions, the logic implemented in `func_1()` and `func_2()` correctly handles the game rules and computes the optimal sum for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
