Output State: **`s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` updates the value of `s` by subtracting the last element of the list `elements` (which is `elements[-i]` since `i` is incremented later) from `s`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `pos` is updated by appending `s - 2 * s2` to it. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
