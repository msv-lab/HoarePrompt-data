Output State: **`s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s2` is reduced by the last element of the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]`, `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`, and `pos` now contains the updated value.**

This means that the list `pos` has had one more element appended to it, which is the value of `s - 2 * s2`. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial postconditions.
