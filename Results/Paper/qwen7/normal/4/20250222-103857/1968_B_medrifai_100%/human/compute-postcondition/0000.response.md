Output State: **`index` is the position where `a[i]` is found in the substring starting from index `j` in `b`, or -1 if not found; `a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the current indices being compared in strings `a` and `b` respectively, such that 0 <= `i` <= len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` <= len(`b`).**

This means that the variable `index` is set to the position (starting from 0) where the substring `a[i]` is first found within the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, then `index` is set to -1. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
