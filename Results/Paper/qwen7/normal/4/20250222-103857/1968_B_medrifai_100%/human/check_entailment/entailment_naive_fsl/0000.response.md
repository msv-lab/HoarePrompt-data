Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
100
11010
```

The expected output should be `3` because the prefix "100" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this case due to the way `func_1` searches for the next character.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. In the given implementation, `func_1` uses `b[j:].find(a[i])` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`.
2. This approach might miss the correct position if there are multiple occurrences of `a[i]` in `b` and the function stops searching after finding the first occurrence.

To fix this, the function should continue searching for the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the remaining part of `b` until it finds all characters of `a` in order. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = j
    for char in a[i:]:
        new_index = b[index:].find(char)
        if new_index == -1:
            return -1
        index += new_index + 1
    return index - 1
```

This corrected function ensures that all characters of `a` are found in order within `b`, thus providing the correct result for all cases.
