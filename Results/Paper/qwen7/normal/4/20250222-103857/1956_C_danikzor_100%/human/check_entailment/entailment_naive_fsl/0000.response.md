Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. However, the current implementation simply prints a fixed formula for the maximum sum and a fixed number of operations without actually performing any meaningful operations on the matrix.

To verify this, let's consider a simple example:

For \(n = 2\):

- The initial matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
- The program outputs a sum of \(7\) and \(2n = 4\) operations, which is incorrect because the maximum possible sum for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix is \(4\) (by setting all elements to \(1\)).

The program should actually perform the operations to set the matrix to \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\) or similar configurations to achieve the maximum sum. However, the current implementation does not do this, hence it fails to meet the problem requirements.
