Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix as \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \).
   - It then prints this sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs two operations:
     - A type 1 operation where the row \( i \) is set to the reverse permutation of the column indices (i.e., \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \)).
     - A type 2 operation where the column \( i \) is set to the reverse permutation of the row indices (i.e., \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \)).

3. **Verification**:
   - The formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \) is derived from the fact that each element \( a_{i,j} \) can take any value from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). By setting each row and column to the reverse permutation, we ensure that each element in the matrix is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n^2 \).
   - Performing the operations as described will indeed result in a matrix where each element is unique and ranges from 1 to \( n^2 \), thus maximizing the sum of the matrix.
   - The number of operations (2 per row, hence \( 2n \) total) is within the allowed limit.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
