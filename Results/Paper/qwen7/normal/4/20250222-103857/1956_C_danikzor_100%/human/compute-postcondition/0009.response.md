Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3.
2. The `print` statement is `print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))`.
   - `1` is a constant integer.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `*range(n, 0, -1)` means unpacking the range from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), with a step of -1.

Given that `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the minimum value for `n` to demonstrate the output, which is 3.

- If `n = 3`, then `range(n, 0, -1)` generates the sequence `[3, 2, 1]`.

So, the `print` statement becomes:
```
print(1, 3, 3, 2, 1)
```

Output: **1 3 3 2 1**
