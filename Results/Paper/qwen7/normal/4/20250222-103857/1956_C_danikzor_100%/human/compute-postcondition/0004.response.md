Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1, but no specific value is provided for `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` function will print multiple arguments separated by spaces.
   - The first argument is `2`.
   - The second argument is `i`, which is explicitly given as 1.
   - The third argument is the result of `*range(n, 0, -1)`, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments.

4. **Range Function**:
   - `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), with a step of `-1`.
   - Since `n` must be at least 1, the sequence will be `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `n` is 1, the sequence is `[1]`.
   - If `n` is 2, the sequence is `[2, 1]`.
   - If `n` is 3, the sequence is `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - And so on...

Given the general form, the output will be `2`, `1`, followed by the numbers from `n` down to `1` (if `n` is greater than 1).

Output: **2 1 n n-1 ... 1** (where `n` is at least 1)
