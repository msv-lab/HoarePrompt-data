### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input `n`.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads the value of `n` and calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - It then performs the operations as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Checking the Calculation**:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
   - Let's verify this formula:
     - For \( n = 1 \): The maximum sum is 1, and the formula gives \( 1 \times (1 + 1) \times (4 \times 1 - 1) // 6 = 1 \).
     - For \( n = 2 \): The maximum sum is 7, and the formula gives \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \).
     - For \( n = 3 \): The maximum sum is 28, and the formula gives \( 3 \times (3 + 1) \times (4 \times 3 - 1) // 6 = 28 \).
   - The formula appears to be correct based on these examples.

4. **Verifying the Operations**:
   - The program prints two operations for each row (or column) of the matrix, setting each element to a permutation of the indices from \( n \) down to 1.
   - Specifically, for each row \( i \):
     - Operation 1: `1 i 1 2 ... n`
     - Operation 2: `2 i 1 2 ... n`
   - These operations ensure that each element in the matrix is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n \), maximizing the sum.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is indeed correct for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The operations performed ensure that each element is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n \), achieving the maximum possible sum.
   - The number of operations used is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the operations do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. The problem specifies that the sum can be maximized by setting each element to a unique value from 1 to \( n \). The given operations set each row and column to the same permutation, which does not necessarily achieve the maximum sum.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum sum, we need to set each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( i + j - 1 \). This ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized because each element is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n^2 \).

### Correct Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n - 1) // 6
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        print(2, i, *[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
