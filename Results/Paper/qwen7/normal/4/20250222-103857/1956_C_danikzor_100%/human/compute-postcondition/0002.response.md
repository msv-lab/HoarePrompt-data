Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Consider the given state**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), and `n` is an input integer. The value of `t` does not directly affect the loop's execution, but `n` does.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
