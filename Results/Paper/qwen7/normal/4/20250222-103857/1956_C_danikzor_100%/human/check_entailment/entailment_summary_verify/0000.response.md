Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its behavior step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations, which is \(2n\).
   - It then performs a loop for each row `i` from 1 to `n`, printing two operations of type 1 and type 2 respectively, where each operation uses the permutation \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\).

However, the key issue lies in the fact that the program does not actually modify the matrix `a` at all. Instead, it prints operations that would theoretically change the matrix, but since the matrix is never updated, the operations have no effect on the actual matrix contents.

To properly maximize the sum of the matrix, the program needs to ensure that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values. The correct approach would involve setting specific rows or columns to permutations that maximize the sum.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the operations, the program should indeed perform operations to fill the matrix with the highest possible values. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results.

For example, for \(n = 2\):
- The initial matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
- The program outputs a sum of \(7\) and \(4\) operations, but the actual maximum sum achievable is \(4\) (by setting the matrix to \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\)).

The program fails to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix, and instead, it prints a fixed formula and operations without modifying the matrix.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
