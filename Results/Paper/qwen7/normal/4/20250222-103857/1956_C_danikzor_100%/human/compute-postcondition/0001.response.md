Based on the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an input integer. The print statement calculates and prints two values:

1. The first value is computed as \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \).
2. The second value is simply \( 2 \times n \).

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we will keep it as `n` in the output description.

Output: **(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)**
