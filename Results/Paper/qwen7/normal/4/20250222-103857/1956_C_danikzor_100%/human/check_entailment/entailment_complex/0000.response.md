Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
3. The provided program attempts to achieve this by performing a series of operations where each row and each column is permuted in reverse order (i.e., `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`).
4. Let's verify if the approach is correct:
   - For each row \( i \), the operation `1 i *range(n, 0, -1)` sets the row \( i \) to `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - Similarly, for each column \( i \), the operation `2 i *range(n, 0, -1)` sets the column \( i \) to `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
5. This process ensures that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to the maximum possible value for that position, which is \( \min(i, j) \). This is because the largest value in the row or column will be placed in the top-left corner, and the values decrease as we move towards the bottom-right corner.
6. The sum of the matrix after these operations is maximized because each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to the maximum possible value for its position.
7. The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations, ensuring the correctness of the sum calculation.
8. The total number of operations is exactly \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the solution to maximize the sum of the matrix and uses exactly \( 2n \) operations.

Correctness: **True**
