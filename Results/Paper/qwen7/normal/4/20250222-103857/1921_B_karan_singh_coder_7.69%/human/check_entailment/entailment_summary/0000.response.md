Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes \( n \), the initial state \( s \), and the target state \( t \).
3. It calculates the number of '1's in both the initial and target states.
4. It computes the number of differing positions between the initial and target states.
5. The logic to determine the minimum number of operations is as follows:
   - If the number of '1's in the initial state is equal to the number of '1's in the target state (\( s1 == t1 \)), the minimum number of operations is simply the number of differing positions (\( cnt \)) if there are any, otherwise 0.
   - If the number of '1's in the initial state is not equal to the number of '1's in the target state, it calculates the difference in the number of '1's (\( d \)). The minimum number of operations is then calculated as half the differing positions minus the difference in the number of '1's, plus the absolute difference in the number of '1's.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the target state.

Correctness: **True**
