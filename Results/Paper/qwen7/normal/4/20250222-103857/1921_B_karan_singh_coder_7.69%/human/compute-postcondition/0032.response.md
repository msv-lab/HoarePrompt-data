Output State: **`cnt` is 4, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in string `t`. Given that `i` is 3, the code checks if `s[3]` is not equal to `t[3]`. Since `cnt` was initially 2, it will be incremented by 1 if the condition is true, making `cnt` equal to 3. However, since the initial state does not specify whether `s[3]` is equal to `t[3]`, we assume the condition is true (as no specific values are given), thus `cnt` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
