Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), followed by two strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters representing the initial and final states of the boxes. For each test case, the function returns information about the transformation from the initial state to the final state of the boxes.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value specifics are not detailed here as per the instruction to focus only on the parameters and return value description.
