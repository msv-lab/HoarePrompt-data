Output State: **`i` is 0; `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Initially, `i` is 0. Since the exact values of `s` and `t` are not given, we can only say that `cnt` will be 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise, it remains 0. The value of `n` is not affected and must still be greater than 0.
