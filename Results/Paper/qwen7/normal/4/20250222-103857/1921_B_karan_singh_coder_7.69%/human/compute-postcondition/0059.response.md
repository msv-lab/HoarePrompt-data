Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, and `s1` is not equal to `t1`; `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

The code assigns the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` to the variable `d`. Since `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` will be a positive integer representing their difference. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
