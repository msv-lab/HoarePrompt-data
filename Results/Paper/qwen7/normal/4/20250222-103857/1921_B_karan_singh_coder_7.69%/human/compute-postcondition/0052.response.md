Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is 2 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration (where `i` is 1), the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was before the loop started or as it was left after the previous iteration.
   - The value of `cnt` depends on the comparison `s[1] != t[1]`. Since we don't have the actual values of `s` and `t`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt` for the next iteration. However, we know that `cnt` will be either 1 or 2 based on the condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `n`, while `cnt` remains as it was after the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is 2 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
