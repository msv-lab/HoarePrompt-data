Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `t` is a newly input string, `t1` is updated to the count of '1' characters in the string `t`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
