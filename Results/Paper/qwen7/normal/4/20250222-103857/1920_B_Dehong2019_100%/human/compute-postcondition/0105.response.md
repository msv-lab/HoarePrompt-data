Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than `i`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, so it remains `i + 1`. The condition that `k` must be greater than `i` is still valid. The variable `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` in the initial state, but now it is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`. The value of `x` is not specified, so it remains as part of the expression.
