Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` plus `a[x-1]` plus `a[i+1]`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `x-1`, `k` is greater than 0, and `(x-1) + x < n` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from its current value. The other variables (`ans2`, `i`, `k`, and the condition involving `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
