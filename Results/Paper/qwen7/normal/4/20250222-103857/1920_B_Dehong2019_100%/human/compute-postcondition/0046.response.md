Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `k`
   - `x` must be greater than `k`
   - `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i]`

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `k` and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must remain greater than `k + 1`.

5. **Updating the States**:
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `x` must be greater than `k + 1`.
   - The value of `ans1` is not directly affected by the loop head but by the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head states, we do not change `ans1`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `x` must be greater than `k + 1`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i]`**
