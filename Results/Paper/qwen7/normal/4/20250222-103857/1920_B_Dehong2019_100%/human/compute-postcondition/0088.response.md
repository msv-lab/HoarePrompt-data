Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `x`.
   - `k` is an unknown value but must be a non-negative integer (since `x` must be greater than 0).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `x` and the loop will continue as long as `i < k`, `i` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `k` and `k` must be a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be less than `k`.
- `k` must be a positive integer (since `x` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at `x`).

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is 0, `ans2` is 0, `i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than `i`**.
