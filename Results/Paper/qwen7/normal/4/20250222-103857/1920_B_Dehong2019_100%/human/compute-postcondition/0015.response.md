Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `k`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`.
   - `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
   - `i` is equal to `x-1`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` will execute if `k` is at least 1.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the loop is `x-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `x-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` should be non-negative (i.e., `i >= 0`).
   - The value of `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final State**:
State: **`ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `i` is equal to `x-1`, `k` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
