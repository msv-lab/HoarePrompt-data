Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, the code effectively subtracts twice the value of `a[1]` from `ans1`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
