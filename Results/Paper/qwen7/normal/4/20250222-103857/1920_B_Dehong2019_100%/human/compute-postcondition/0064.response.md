Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, and `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x >= n`, no additional changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`; `ans2` is equal to `max(ans1, ans2)` after this operation.**

This means that `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of the current `ans1` and `ans2`. The other variables (`ans1`, `i`, and `x`) remain as they were before the operation, with the condition that if `i + x < n`, `ans1` will be further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2` and `ans2` will be updated accordingly. If `i + x >= n`, no further changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.
