Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is 0, `ans2` is 0**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input()`, splits it into a list, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and sorts the list in descending order using `sorted(..., reverse=True)`. The initial values of `ans1` and `ans2` are set to 0 before the sorting operation. Therefore, after executing the code, `a` will be a sorted list of integers in descending order, and both `ans1` and `ans2` will remain 0.
