Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the `if` statement is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if m < a or m < b:` is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` because the LCM will give us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The formula to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time involves calculating how many multiples of `a` and `b` fit into `m + 1` and then adjusting for overlaps.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function uses the LCM to ensure that overlaps between the firing intervals of the two installations are properly accounted for, thus providing the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
