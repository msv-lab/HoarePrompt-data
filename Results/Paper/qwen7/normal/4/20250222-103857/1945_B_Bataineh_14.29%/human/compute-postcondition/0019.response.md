Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers whose values are updated to the integers obtained from the last input split by spaces. After all iterations, regardless of the condition `m < a or m < b`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged for each iteration, but the final value of `i` will be `t-1`.
