Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from input, `b` is assigned the second integer from input, `m` is assigned the third integer from input.**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input separated by spaces and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged except that now `a`, `b`, and `m` hold the values of the integers input by the user.
