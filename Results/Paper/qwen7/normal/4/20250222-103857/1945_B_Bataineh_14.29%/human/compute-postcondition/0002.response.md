Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
