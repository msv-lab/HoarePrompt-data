Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`, which means it will print the integer 2 regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output: **2**
