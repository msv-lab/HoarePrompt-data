### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the program's logic. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` overcounts the number of fireworks visible at the same time because it does not account for the overlap between the two installations. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determine how many fireworks can be visible at any given time. The key insight is that the fireworks from both installations will overlap at multiples of their LCM.

Let's derive the correct approach:

1. **Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`:**
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` is the smallest number that is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.
   - We can use the relationship: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.

2. **Determine the number of fireworks visible at any time:**
   - The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at any time `x` is `x // a`.
   - The number of fireworks from the second installation visible at any time `x` is `x // b`.
   - The number of fireworks from both installations visible at any time `x` is `x // LCM(a, b)`.
   - Therefore, the total number of fireworks visible at any time `x` is `(x // a) + (x // b) - (x // LCM(a, b)) + 1`.

3. **Find the maximum number of fireworks visible:**
   - We need to find the maximum value of `(x // a) + (x // b) - (x // LCM(a, b)) + 1` for `x` ranging from `0` to `m`.

Given these steps, let's modify the program to correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        max_visible = 0
        for x in range(0, m + 1):
            visible_from_a = x // a
            visible_from_b = x // b
            visible_from_both = x // lcm_ab
            max_visible = max(max_visible, visible_from_a + visible_from_b - visible_from_both + 1)
        
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The corrected program accurately computes the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the overlap between the two installations. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.

**Final: True**
