### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program overcounts the number of fireworks visible at the same time. Let's re-evaluate the logic and provide a corrected approach.

#### Corrected Approach:

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM of `a` and `b` gives us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. 

1. **Case When `m < a` or `m < b`:**
   - If `m < a` or `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is indeed `2`. This is because neither installation can launch more than one firework within `m` minutes, and they both launch at least one firework at time `0`.

2. **General Case (`m >= a` and `m >= b`):**
   - We need to calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m` minutes and account for the overlap.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m` minutes is `m // a + 1` (including the initial launch at time `0`).
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m` minutes is `m // b + 1` (including the initial launch at time `0`).
   - However, we need to subtract the number of overlaps, which is the number of times both installations launch fireworks simultaneously within `m` minutes. This is given by `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.

The corrected formula would be:
\[ \text{max\_fireworks} = (m // a + 1) + (m // b + 1) - (m // \text{lcm}(a, b) + 1) \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ \text{max\_fireworks} = m // a + m // b - m // \text{lcm}(a, b) + 1 \]

#### Implementation:

We need to compute the LCM of `a` and `b` using the formula:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
            max_fireworks = (m // a + 1) + (m // b + 1) - (m // lcm_ab + 1)
            print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected approach, the original assessment was inaccurate because it did not account for the correct calculation of the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The new implementation correctly handles the overlap and provides the accurate result.

Final: **True**
