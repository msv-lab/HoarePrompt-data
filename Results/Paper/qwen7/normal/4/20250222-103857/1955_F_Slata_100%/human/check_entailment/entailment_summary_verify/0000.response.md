### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, aiming to maximize Bob's wins.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- It calculates and prints the total count of ones, twos, and threes, adjusted based on certain conditions involving the remainders when divided by 2.
- The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2`: This part of the formula divides the counts of ones, twos, and threes by 2 and sums them up. This is likely intended to simulate removing pairs of numbers (since 2s and 3s can be paired to make 1s).
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of ones, twos, and threes when divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it adds 1 to the result.

2. **Bitwise XOR Consideration**:
   - The program does not explicitly compute the bitwise XOR of the sequence. Instead, it relies on the counts of ones, twos, and threes to determine the outcome.
   - The logic `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` is meant to simulate the effect of removing numbers to achieve a specific parity (odd or even) of the remaining numbers' contributions to the XOR result.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: Input `1 1 1 0`
     - Sequence: `[1, 1, 1]`
     - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1` (Alice wins)
     - Program Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `0`)
   - **Example 2**: Input `0 9 9 9`
     - Sequence: `[2, 2, ..., 2]` (9 times)
     - XOR: `2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 = 0` (Bob wins)
     - Program Output: `12` (Incorrect, should be `1`)

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game's rules. It does not compute the actual bitwise XOR of the sequence but instead uses a heuristic based on the counts of ones, twos, and threes.
   - The heuristic used in the program does not guarantee the correct number of Bob's wins because it does not account for the specific sequence of XOR operations.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game's rules and is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
