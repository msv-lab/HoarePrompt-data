Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   ```python
   a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Expression**:
   - `a // 2`: Integer division of `a` by 2.
   - `b // 2`: Integer division of `b` by 2.
   - `c // 2`: Integer division of `c` by 2.
   - `d // 2`: Integer division of `d` by 2.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 equals 3. If it does, this expression evaluates to 1; otherwise, it evaluates to 0.

4. **Summing Up**:
   - The expression sums up the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2.
   - It adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 equals 3, otherwise, it adds 0.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are unknown, but we can describe the output based on their properties.

Output: **(a // 2) + (b // 2) + (c // 2) + (d // 2) + int((a % 2) + (b % 2) + (c % 2) == 3)**
