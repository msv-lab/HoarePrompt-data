Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. This means that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set up the initial conditions for `i` and `t`. Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < int(input())`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `t` is correctly set.

5. **Final State Before the Loop Starts**: 
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `t` should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
