The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total count of these numbers, adjusted based on certain conditions involving the remainders when divided by 2. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
