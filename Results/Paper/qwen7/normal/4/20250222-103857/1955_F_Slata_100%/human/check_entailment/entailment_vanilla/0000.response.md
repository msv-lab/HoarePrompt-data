Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Game Process**: Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to find the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
4. **Input**: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_i \) representing the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
5. **Output**: For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Program Analysis:
The given function `func()` reads the input and prints a value based on the formula:
\[ \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3) \]

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Floor Division**: 
   - \( \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor \): This counts how many pairs of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be removed without affecting the XOR result.
   - \( \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor \): Similarly, these terms account for even counts of 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - \( a \% 2 \): Checks if there is an odd number of 1s.
   - \( b \% 2 \): Checks if there is an odd number of 2s.
   - \( c \% 2 \): Checks if there is an odd number of 3s.
   - The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` ensures that if the sum of the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s equals 3, it adds 1 to the result.

### Correctness Check:
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the formula correctly reflects the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

1. **Even Counts**:
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are even, removing pairs of them does not affect the XOR result, and thus Alice wins.

2. **Odd Counts**:
   - If there is an odd count of 1s, 2s, or 3s, removing pairs still leaves one odd count, which means Alice can still win unless the sum of the odd counts equals 3, in which case Bob can win once.

Given this analysis, the provided formula seems to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

**Correctness: True**
