Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 3, indicating that the loop has completed 3 iterations. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will retain their most recent values obtained from the last input provided, as these variables are not modified within the loop body.
