Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. It returns the total count of these numbers.**

This means the function is designed to take a single test case, which is a tuple or list of four integers, and return the sum of these integers. The integers represent counts of different types of elements in a sequence, and the function simply adds them up to provide the total count.
