Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` includes `a[r - m]`, `done` remains unchanged, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is `m + 1`, `r - m` equals 1. Therefore, `old` is set to `a[1]`. The values of `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged.
