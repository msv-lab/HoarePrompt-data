Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `extra` does not include `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `a[r - m]` from the set `extra`.
- Since `extra` was previously containing `a[r - m]`, after removing it, `extra` no longer includes `a[r - m]`.
- The value of `done` is updated based on whether `old` is in `done`. If `old` is in `done`, `done` is updated to `done - old`. If `old` is not in `done`, `done` remains unchanged.
- The presence of `a[r]` in `todo` and the conditions under which `ans` is incremented remain the same as before the execution of the code.
