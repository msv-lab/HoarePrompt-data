Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `extra` list has the value of `old` removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, and `old` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `extra`, which now does not contain the element `old`.
