Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `extra` list remains unchanged, `done` list has the element `a[r]` added, and `todo` list has had the element `a[r]` removed. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.
