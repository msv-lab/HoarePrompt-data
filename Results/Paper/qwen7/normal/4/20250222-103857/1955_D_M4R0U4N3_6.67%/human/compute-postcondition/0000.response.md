State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, input function is called and returns the number of test cases (let's call this value num_test_cases), num_test_cases must be at least 1**.

Explanation:
- The loop head `for _ in range(int(input())):` indicates that the loop will run based on the value returned by the `input()` function.
- The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop, but the key information here is the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will execute.
- Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- After the first iteration of the loop, the value of `num_test_cases` (which is the result of `int(input())`) will be used to determine the number of remaining iterations. However, for the loop to start executing, `num_test_cases` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and after the loop starts, `input()` must return a value that is at least 1.
