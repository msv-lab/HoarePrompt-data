Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, and `j` is 3; `extra` contains `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` (which is `a[2]` since `j` is 2) to the set `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
