Output State: **`r` is `m`, `old` remains in `extra` and `done`, `extra` includes `a[r]`, and `done` includes `old`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `old` was either added to `todo` and removed from `extra` and `done`, or remained in `extra` and `done` unchanged, its state remains the same. The value of `r` is unchanged and is still `m`. Therefore, `extra` now includes `a[r]`, and `done` still includes `old`.
