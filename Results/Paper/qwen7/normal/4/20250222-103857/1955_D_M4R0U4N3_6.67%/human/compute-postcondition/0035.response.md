Output State: **`r` is `m`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is no longer in `done`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. Since `old` was previously in `done`, after executing `done.remove(old)`, `old` will no longer be in `done`. The values of `r` and `old` being in `extra` remain unchanged.
