Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is either no longer in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` plus `a[r]`, and `todo` does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. This changes the value of `done` to include `a[r]` in addition to whatever elements were already present. All other variables remain unchanged.
