Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is equal to the length of `a`, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing all elements from `todo` that were found in `a`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop runs through all its iterations (i.e., for each index `j` from `0` to `m-1`), `todo` will only contain elements that were never found in the list `a`, `done` will contain all elements from `todo` that were found in `a`, and `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not initially in `todo`.
