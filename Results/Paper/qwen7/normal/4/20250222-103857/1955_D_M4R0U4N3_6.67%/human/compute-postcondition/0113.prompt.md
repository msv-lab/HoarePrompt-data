Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer minus 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is the last element processed in the loop, `extra` is an empty set, `done` is an empty set, `todo` is now a set of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0; if the element at index `j` in list `a` is in the list `todo`, then `todo` is the list with the element at index `j` removed, and `done` contains the element `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is now in `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`. If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `extra` is updated to include `a[2]`. If `a[0]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` is updated to include `a[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
