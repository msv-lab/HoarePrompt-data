Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`**.

In this case, the code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is `m + 1`, `r - m` equals 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `a[1]`, we express `old` as `a[r - m]`, which simplifies to `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
