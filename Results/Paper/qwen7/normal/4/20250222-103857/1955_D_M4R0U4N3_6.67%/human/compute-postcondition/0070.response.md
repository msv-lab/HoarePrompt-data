Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `r` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop itself. The other variables (`m`, `n`, `a`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, `ans`) are not directly modified by the loop but may change based on the loop body.

2. **Determine the new value of `r`**: The loop starts with `r = m + 1` and increments `r` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `r` will be `m + 2`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `r < n`. Since `r` was `m + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `r` is `m + 2`. For the loop to continue, `m + 2` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `r` will be `m + 2`.
- `m`, `n`, `a`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is either no longer in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` is in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
