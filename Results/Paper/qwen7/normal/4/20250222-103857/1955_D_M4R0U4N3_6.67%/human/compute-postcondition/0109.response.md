Output State: **`j` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is with `a[0]` removed, `done` now contains `a[0]`, and `extra` contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `j` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `todo` is with `a[0]` removed.
- `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty.
- `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`.

After executing `done.add(a[j])`:
- Since `j` is 2, `a[j]` refers to `a[2]`.
- `done` adds `a[2]` to its contents.
- `todo` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.
- `extra` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation unless `a[2]` was not previously in `extra`, but the problem does not specify any conditions for `extra` beyond its initial state, so it is assumed to remain as specified.

Therefore, the updated state is as described above.
