Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `m` is an integer equal to the second input value, `k` is an integer equal to the third input value, and the input value `n-1` is no longer directly referenced.**

This means that the input value `n-1` from the initial state is no longer directly referenced, but the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers corresponding to the first, second, and third input values respectively.
