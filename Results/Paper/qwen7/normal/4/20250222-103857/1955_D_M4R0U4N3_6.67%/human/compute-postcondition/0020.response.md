Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - `extra` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`
   - `todo` does not contain `a[0]`
   - `done` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, depending on whether `a[j]` was in `todo` or not.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 3 (since `j` is now 3).

5. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `m` must remain greater than 3.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` is 3
   - `m` must be greater than 3
   - `extra` remains unchanged (contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`)
   - `todo` remains unchanged (does not contain `a[0]`)
   - `done` remains unchanged (contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, depending on whether `a[3]` was in `todo` or not).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `extra` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `todo` does not contain `a[0]`, and `done` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]` depending on whether `a[3]` was in `todo` or not**.
