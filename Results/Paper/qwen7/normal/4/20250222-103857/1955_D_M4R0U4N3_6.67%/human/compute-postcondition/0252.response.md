Output State: **`ans` is 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 1; `r` is `m + 1`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` and `done` each contain `a[r]`; otherwise, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` has had `old` removed from it. Otherwise, `todo` contains `old`, and `done` has removed `old` if `old` was in `done`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial condition states that `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0, after incrementing, `ans` will be 2 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` will be 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
