Output State: **`j` is 0; `todo` is the list with the element at index `j` removed; `done` contains the element `a[j]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Since `j` is 0, the element at index 0 of `a` is added to `done`. The state of `j` and `todo` remains unchanged from the initial state.
