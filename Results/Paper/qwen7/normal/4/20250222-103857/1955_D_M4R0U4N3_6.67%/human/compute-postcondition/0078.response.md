Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done` and `ans` remain as follows: if `old` is in `extra`, then `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` is reduced by `old` if `old` was present, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k`. If `old` is not in `done`, `done` remains unchanged, and `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`; `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`.**

In this output state, the `todo` set has had its element `a[r]` removed. All other variables retain their previous conditions based on the given initial state and the logic described.
