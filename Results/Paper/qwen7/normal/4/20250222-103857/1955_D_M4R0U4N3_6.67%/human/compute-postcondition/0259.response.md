Output State: **`done` now contains the element `old` removed, `todo` contains the element `old` added, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code `todo.add(old)` adds the element `old` to the set `todo`. The initial state tells us that `done` has had the element `old` removed, which means `done` no longer contains `old`. Since `a[r - m]` retains its original value, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `todo` containing `old` and `a[r - m]` retaining its original value.
