Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` in the range `range(m)`. This means `j` will take values from `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` starts from `0` (the first value in the range `range(m)`), we need to ensure `j` is `0` at the start of the loop.

3. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, `ans`, and `a`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop starts. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

4. **Formulate the final state**: Based on the above analysis, the only variable that needs adjustment is `j`, which should be `0` at the start of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0**
