Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `m-1`. The variable `todo` will contain the elements of `a` that were not added to `done`. The set `done` will contain all unique elements from `a` that were present in `todo` during the loop's execution. The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo` and were not already in `extra`. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0.**

This means that after the loop completes, `j` will have iterated through all indices of the list `a` (from 0 to `m-1`). The `todo` set will hold any remaining elements from `a` that were never added to `done`. The `done` set will contain all distinct elements from `a` that were successfully moved from `todo` to `done` during the loop's execution. The `extra` set will include all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` initially but were added to `extra` when they weren't found in `todo`. Finally, `ans` will reflect whether the number of unique elements added to `done` meets or exceeds the threshold `k`.
