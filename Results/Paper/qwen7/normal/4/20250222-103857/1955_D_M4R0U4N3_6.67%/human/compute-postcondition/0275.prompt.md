Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `r` will be equal to `n`, `old` will be the last element processed in the loop, `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop, `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were removed from `todo`, and `todo` will contain none of the elements from `a` that were initially in `todo` and not removed during the loop. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `r` will be equal to `n-1`. `m` is some integer, and `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `done` will contain `a[r]`, and `extra` will remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` will contain `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` will remain unchanged. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0. All elements of `a` that were not added to `done` will be in `extra`. The set `done` will contain all unique elements from `a` that were present in `todo` during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is equal to the number of times `len(done)` has reached or exceeded `k` during the loop's execution; `r` is equal to `n - 1`; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` after the last iteration; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` and `done` each contain `a[r]`; otherwise, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` has had `old` removed from it. Otherwise, `todo` contains `old`, and `done` has removed `old` if `old` was in `done`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the total count of times the length of `done` met or surpassed the threshold `k`. The variable `r` will be set to `n - 1`, indicating the last index processed in the loop. The variable `old` will store the value of the last element (`a[r - m]`) that was checked within the loop. Depending on the final state of the elements in `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, these sets will reflect the elements that were added or removed based on the conditions specified in the loop body.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
