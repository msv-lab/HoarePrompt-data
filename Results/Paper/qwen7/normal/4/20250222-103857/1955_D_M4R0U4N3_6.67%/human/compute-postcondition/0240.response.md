Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `extra` has had `old` removed from it.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the `extra` list. The values of `ans`, `r`, and `old` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is in the `extra` list, which now does not contain the `old` element.
