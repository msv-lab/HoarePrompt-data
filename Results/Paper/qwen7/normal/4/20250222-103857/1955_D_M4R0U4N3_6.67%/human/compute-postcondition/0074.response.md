Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]` (depending on its previous state), `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` was in `done`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged if `old` is not in `done`, `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`, and if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the set `todo` has been updated to include `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was previously in `done`, or it contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` was not in `done`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, with the exception of `done` which may have been modified, and `ans` which may have been incremented if the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.
