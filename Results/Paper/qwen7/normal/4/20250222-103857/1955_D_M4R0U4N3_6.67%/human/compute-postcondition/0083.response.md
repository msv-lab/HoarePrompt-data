Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged as per their postconditions.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. The postconditions for `r`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain the same as they were before the increment operation.
