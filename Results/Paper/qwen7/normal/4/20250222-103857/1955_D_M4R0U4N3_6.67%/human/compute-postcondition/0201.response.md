Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is an integer (not used in the loop).
   - `todo` is a set of integers.
   - `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`.
   - `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`.
   - If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `done` now includes `a[2]` and `todo` has `a[j]` removed.
   - If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[2]` and `j` is set to 3.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value (let's call it `j_end`), and `m` is still greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`.
   - `m` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `todo` remains unchanged.
   - `done` remains unchanged.
   - `extra` remains unchanged.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `j` is `j_end + 1`.
   - `m` is still greater than 1.

Given that `j` was increased by 1 and `m` remains the same, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `j` is `j_end + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `j_end` is not specified, we can represent it as `j_end + 1` where `j_end` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the final state is:

**State: `a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `j` is `j_end + 1`**.
