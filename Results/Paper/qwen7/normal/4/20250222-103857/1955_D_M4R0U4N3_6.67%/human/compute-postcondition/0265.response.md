Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, `done` now contains `old`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `old` was previously determined to be either in `extra` or `done`, or neither, adding `a[r]` to `done` means `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is now in `done`. The other conditions specified in the initial state are maintained: `old` is not in `extra`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value.
