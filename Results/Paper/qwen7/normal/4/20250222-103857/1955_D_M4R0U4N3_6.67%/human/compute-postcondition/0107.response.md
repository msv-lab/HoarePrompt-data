Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `range(m)`, meaning `j` will take values from `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is currently `1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed.
   - `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty.
   - `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is currently `1`, the next value it will take is `2`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be `2`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - `todo` remains either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed (since `j` does not directly affect `todo`).
   - `done` remains unchanged unless `a[0]` was in `todo` and `j` was the last occurrence of `a[0]` in `todo`, but since `j` is increasing by `1`, this is not directly affected by `j`.
   - `extra` will include `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`**.
