Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` - 1, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `todo` contains `old`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is no longer in `done`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` remains unchanged based on the condition of the length of `done`. The variable `r` and `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) also remain unchanged. The set `todo` now includes the element `old`, and `old` is no longer part of the list `done`.
