Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results. For example, consider the input `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, this set of scores is not achievable through any combination of games, but the program incorrectly outputs `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * p1 - 2 * p2 - 2 * p3 + 3 * (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2) // 2
        
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the possible draws
        if max_draws > (p3 - p1):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version first checks if the total points are even. If not, it prints `-1` immediately. Then it calculates the maximum possible number of draws and ensures that the calculated draws do not exceed the possible draws given the scores. This ensures the program handles all cases correctly.
