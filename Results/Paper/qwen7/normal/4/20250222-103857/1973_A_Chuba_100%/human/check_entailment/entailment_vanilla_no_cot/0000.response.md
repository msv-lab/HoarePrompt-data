Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1` checks if the total score is odd. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine if the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. The sum of scores should be even because each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is incorrect. The logic to compute the maximum number of draws needs to consider the constraints of the game more carefully. Specifically, the formula should account for the fact that each draw gives 1 point to each player, and each win/loss scenario gives 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Total points must be even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * (p3 - p1)) // 2
        
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the possible points from wins
        if max_draws > (p3 - p1) + (p2 - p1):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version first checks if the total points are even. Then, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws while ensuring that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the possible points from wins.
