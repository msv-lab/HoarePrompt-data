Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the maximum possible number of draws. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Checking for Consistency**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is even. This is not sufficient to ensure consistency. For example, if the scores are `1, 1, 2`, the sum is even, but these scores cannot be achieved without a contradiction in the game rules.

2. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws, `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`, does not correctly account for the constraints of the game. Specifically, it does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the constraints of the game.

3. **Handling Inconsistent Scores**: The program prints `-1` only when the sum of the scores is odd, but this is not the only condition under which the scores can be inconsistent. For example, the scores `1, 1, 2` are inconsistent because they cannot be achieved by any combination of wins, losses, and draws.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
