Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and there will be no further values of `v` to process.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, once the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will become 0. At this point, there are no more values of `v` to process since the loop condition (`t > 0`) will no longer be satisfied.
