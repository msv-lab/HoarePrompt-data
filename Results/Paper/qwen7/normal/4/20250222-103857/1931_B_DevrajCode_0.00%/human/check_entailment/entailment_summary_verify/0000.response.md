### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and flow of the provided program. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - It extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns "No". This check ensures that the problem's constraints are met, as the sum of `a` is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`.

2. **Target Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the target amount of water each container should have by dividing the total amount of water by `n`.
   - This step is crucial because it sets the goal for the distribution of water.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program initializes a `container` variable to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current sum of water and `n` times the target.
   - It iterates through each container, updating the `container` variable by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target.
   - If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, it means there is an imbalance in the distribution, and the program returns "No".
   - If the loop completes without the `container` variable becoming negative, it means the water can be distributed evenly, and the program returns "Yes".

The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the provided examples. The function `func_1` correctly implements the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations.
