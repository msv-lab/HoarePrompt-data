Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns "No" because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. **Target Calculation**: If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount is balanced. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water across all containers, and the program returns "No".

4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning "No", it means the water can be distributed evenly, and the program returns "Yes".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem description and examples.
