Output State: **`container` is `container + 2 * water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `water` is the third element of `a`**.

Explanation: The line `container += water - target` updates the value of `container` by adding `water - target` to its current value. Since `water` is the third element of `a`, and `target` is `total_water // n`, the updated value of `container` becomes `container + water - target`. The other variables remain unchanged.
