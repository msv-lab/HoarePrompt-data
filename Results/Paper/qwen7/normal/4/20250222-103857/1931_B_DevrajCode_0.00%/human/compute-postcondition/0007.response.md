Output State: **`container` is `water` - `target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `water` is the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `container` by adding `water - target` to its current value. Here, `water` is the first element of `a`, and `target` is calculated as `total_water // n`. The other variables (`total_water`, `n`, and `target`) remain unchanged.
