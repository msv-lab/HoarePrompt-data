You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the specified cow `k`.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `k`, and the ratings of the cows.
   - It converts `k` to a zero-based index.

2. **Finding Possible Matches:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of cow ratings.
   - It identifies the positions where the cow with rating `x` (the cow at position `k`) would lose to other cows with higher ratings.
   - It stores these positions in the list `ind`.
   - If there are no such positions (`ind == []`), it returns `n - 1` because the cow could potentially win all matches if it is the highest-rated cow.
   - If there is exactly one such position, it calculates the number of wins based on the position of this cow relative to `k`.
   - If there are two such positions, it calculates the number of wins based on the positions of these two cows relative to `k`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where the cow at position `k` is the highest-rated cow or where it is positioned in a way that limits its potential wins.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - When `ind == []`, the function returns `n - 1`, which is correct because the cow could win all matches if it is the highest-rated cow.
  - When `len(ind) == 1`, the function handles the case where the cow at position `k` loses to only one other cow. This is handled correctly based on the relative positions.
  - When `len(ind) == 2`, the function calculates the number of wins based on the positions of the two cows. This is also handled correctly.

- **General Case:**
  - The function correctly identifies the positions where the cow at position `k` would lose and calculates the number of wins based on these positions.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the specified cow `k`. It handles all edge cases and general cases appropriately.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
