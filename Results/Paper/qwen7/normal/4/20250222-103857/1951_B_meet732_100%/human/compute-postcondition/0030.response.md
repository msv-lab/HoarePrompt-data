Output State: **`i` is 2, `c` is either 2 or 3 (depending on whether `a[2]` is greater than `x`), `ind` is a list containing 0 and possibly 2 (if `a[2]` is greater than `x`), and the loop has completed all iterations.**

In this final state, the loop has iterated through all elements of the list `a`. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list, meaning it has gone through each index from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `c` will be 2 if `a[0]` was greater than `x` and `a[2]` was not greater than `x`, or it will be 3 if `a[2]` was also greater than `x`. The list `ind` will contain the indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, starting with index 0 and including index 2 if `a[2]` was greater than `x`. The loop has terminated because `c` reached 2 or the end of the list was reached.
