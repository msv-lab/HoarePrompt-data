Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, but it is used as the upper limit for the range function.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the first iteration, we can set `i` to 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `ind`, `a`, `c`, and `x` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
