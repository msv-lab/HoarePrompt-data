Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `a[i] > x`, the condition remains unchanged.
   - If `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, the condition also remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
