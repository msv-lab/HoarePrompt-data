Output State: **`i` is 2; `ind` is a list containing 2**

The code `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `ind`. Since `i` is initially 2, after appending, `ind` becomes a list containing the element 2. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this code, so it remains valid.
