Output State: **The program returns the maximum value among the list pos, which is calculated as s - 2 * n for each iteration from 1 to 3, where s is the original sum of elements minus the sum of the last 3 elements, and n is the sum of the last 3 elements of elements while handling potential IndexError by setting n to 0 if an error occurs.**

To break it down:
- `removals` is set to 3.
- `i` is set to 4.
- `s` is the original sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last 3 elements.
- `n` is the sum of the last 3 elements of `elements`, but if an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.
- `pos` is a list containing the values of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to 3.
- The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.
