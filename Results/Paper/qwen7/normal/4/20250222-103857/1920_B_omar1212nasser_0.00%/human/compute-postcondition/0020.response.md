Output State: **`removals` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-4]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-4] + elements[-4] - elements[-5]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`, and `pos` has had the value `s - 2 * n` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` decrements `s` by the value of `elements[-i]`. Initially, `i` is 3, so `s` is updated to `s - elements[-3]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (as per typical behavior in similar contexts), making `i` equal to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
