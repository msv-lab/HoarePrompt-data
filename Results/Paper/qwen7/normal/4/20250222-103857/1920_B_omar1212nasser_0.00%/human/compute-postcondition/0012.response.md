Output State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. The value of `s` is updated from the initial state to `s` minus `elements[-1]`, and the value of `n` remains as per the initial state condition. The variable `i` and the condition for `n` remain unchanged. The new list `pos` is created with the calculated value.
