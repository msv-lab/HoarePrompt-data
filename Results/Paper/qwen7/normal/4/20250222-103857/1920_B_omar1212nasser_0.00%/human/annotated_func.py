#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `product` is the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case, and these results are printed for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be at least as large as the number of test cases provided initially. The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the variable `product` holds the result of the function `func_2(k, x, a)`, and these results are printed out for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value for each test case. Finally, it prints the computed product value for each test case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove (1 ≤ removals ≤ n), negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 (1 ≤ negatives ≤ n), and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals is an integer with a value between 1 and 6, negatives is an integer with a value between 1 and 3, and elements is a list of integers where either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: `removals` must be exactly 3, `i` is 4 (since the loop runs from 1 to `removals + 1` and `removals` is 3), `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `n` is the adjusted sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` considering the `IndexError` handling, `pos` is a list containing the values of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to 3.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
    #- `removals` will be set to 3.
    #- `i` will be 4 (the last value it takes).
    #- `s` will be the original sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last 3 elements.
    #- `n` will be calculated based on the last 3 elements of `elements` while handling potential `IndexError` by setting `n` to 0 if an error occurs.
    #- `pos` will be a list containing the results of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to 3.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the list pos, which is calculated as s - 2 * n for each iteration from 1 to 3, where s is the original sum of elements minus the sum of the last 3 elements, and n is the sum of the last 3 elements of elements while handling potential IndexError by setting n to 0 if an error occurs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array elements). It returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the values of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to `removals`, where `s` is the original sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`, handling potential `IndexError` by setting `n` to 0 if an error occurs.
