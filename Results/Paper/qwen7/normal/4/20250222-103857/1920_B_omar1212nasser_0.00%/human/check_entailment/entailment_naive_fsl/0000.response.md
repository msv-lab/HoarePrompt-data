Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` has hardcoded logic that checks if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, and returns 0 in that case. This hardcoded condition is not based on the problem description and does not cover all possible scenarios.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4
6 5 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6
```

- Expected Output:
```
4
-2
-14
```

- Actual Output using the provided code:
```
4
-2
0
```

In the last test case, the function incorrectly returns 0 instead of -14. This is because the hardcoded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3` is not a general solution and does not account for the actual logic required to solve the problem for all inputs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
