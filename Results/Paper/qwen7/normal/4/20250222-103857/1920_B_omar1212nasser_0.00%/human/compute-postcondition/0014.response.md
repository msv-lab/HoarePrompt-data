Output State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` plus `elements[-2]` minus `elements[-3]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` decrements `s` by the value of `elements[-i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `s` is updated to `s - elements[-3]`. The values of `removals`, `i`, `n`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
