Output State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2] + elements[-2] - elements[-3]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`, and `pos` has had the value `s - 2 * n` appended to it.**

In this output state, the `pos` list now contains one additional element, which is the value of `s - 2 * n`. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions as given in the initial state.
