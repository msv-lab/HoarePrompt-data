Output State: **`removals` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-4]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4] + elements[-4] - elements[-5] + elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurs, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`, and `s - 2 * n` has been appended to `pos`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since the value of `s - 2 * n` is already known from the initial state, it is added to the list `pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.
