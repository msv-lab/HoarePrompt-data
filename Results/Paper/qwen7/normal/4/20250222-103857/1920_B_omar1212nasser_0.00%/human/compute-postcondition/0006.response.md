Output State: **`removals` is an integer with a value between 1 and 6, `negatives` is an integer with a value between 1 and 3, `elements` is a list of integers where either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Here, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
