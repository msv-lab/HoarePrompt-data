Output State: The value of `h` will be the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`, and `n` will be reduced by `i * (n // i)` for each `i` in `costs`.

In more detail, `h` will accumulate the integer division of `n` by each element in `costs`, and `n` will be successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and the integer division result. After executing the loop for all iterations, `h` represents the total sum of these integer divisions, and `n` is the final value after all subtractions.
