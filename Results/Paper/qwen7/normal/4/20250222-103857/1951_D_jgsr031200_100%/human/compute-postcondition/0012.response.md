Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `costs`.

2. **Understand the Iterable `costs`**: The `costs` list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

3. **Determine the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `costs` list. Therefore, the loop will execute if `costs` is a non-empty list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the `costs` list during each iteration.
   - The list `costs` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `h` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k` (this does not directly affect the loop execution either).
- `k` is a positive integer (this does not directly affect the loop execution either).
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.

Since `costs` is guaranteed to have at least two elements, the loop will always execute regardless of the values of `h`, `n`, and `k`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the list `costs` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`costs` is a list containing at least one element**
