Output State: **`h` is increased by `curr`, `curr` is `n // i`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be `n // i`. This means `curr` now holds the integer division of `n` by `i`. The values of `h`, `n`, and the initial condition that `costs` must contain at least one element remain unchanged.
