Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If it's possible, we need to provide the number of stalls and their respective prices.

### Given Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1 stall, and price 1, which is a valid solution.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO", indicating it's impossible to buy `k` jewels.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from the first stall (`n - k + 1`) and the second stall (`1`). These values are stored in `costs`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls (`curr`), updates `h` (the total number of jewels bought so far), and adjusts `n` accordingly.
   - Finally, it checks if `h` (total jewels bought) is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2 stalls, and the calculated prices.

### Issues in the Given Program
1. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is very large and `k` is small, leading to potential issues in the calculation of `curr` and `h`.
   - The logic for setting up more than 2 stalls is missing. The program assumes only 2 stalls are needed, which might not always be the case.

2. **General Solution:**
   - The program should consider more general scenarios where more than 2 stalls might be required. For example, if `n` is significantly larger than `k`, more stalls might be necessary.

### Corrected Approach
To ensure correctness, the program should:
- Consider the possibility of needing more than 2 stalls.
- Ensure that the total number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- Provide a general approach to distribute the prices among the stalls.

### Corrected Program
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize the number of stalls and their prices
    stalls = []
    current_price = 1
    remaining_jewels = k
    num_stalls = 0

    while remaining_jewels > 0 and num_stalls < 60:
        # Calculate the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at the current price
        max_jewels = min(n // current_price, remaining_jewels)
        if max_jewels == 0:
            break
        stalls.append(current_price)
        remaining_jewels -= max_jewels
        n -= max_jewels * current_price
        current_price += 1
        num_stalls += 1

    if remaining_jewels == 0 and num_stalls <= 60:
        print('YES')
        print(num_stalls)
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion
The original program has limitations and does not cover all edge cases. The corrected program ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60 and provides a general approach to distributing the prices among the stalls.

**Correctness: False**
