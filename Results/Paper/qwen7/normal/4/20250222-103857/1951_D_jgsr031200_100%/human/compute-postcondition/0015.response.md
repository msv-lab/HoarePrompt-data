Output State: **`costs` is a list containing at least one element; `h` is increased by `curr`; `curr` is `n // i`; `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. The values of `costs`, `h`, and `curr` remain unchanged. `h` is increased by `curr` and `curr` is `n // i` before this line of code executes. Therefore, the updated state includes these changes.
