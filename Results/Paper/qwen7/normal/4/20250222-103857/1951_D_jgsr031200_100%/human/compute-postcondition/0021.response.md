Output State: **`h` is `h + curr`, `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr`, `curr` is `n // i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by performing integer division of `n` by `i`. The values of `h` and `n` are updated according to their previous definitions, but now `curr` is set to the result of `n // i`. The precondition that `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr` remains valid, but since `n` is already decreased by this amount before the line of code is executed, the updated value of `n` is `n - (i * curr)`. However, the exact value of `n` after this operation is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it in the form of the expression.
