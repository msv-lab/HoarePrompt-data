Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `h` is now `h + curr`
  - `n` is decreased by `i * curr`
- The for loop statement:
  ```python
  for i in costs:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is taken from the `costs` list.
   - No other variables are directly modified within the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `costs` list.
   - After each iteration, `i` is taken from the `costs` list and used in the loop body.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is taken from the `costs` list, no changes are needed for `i` itself.
   - The state of `h` and `n` needs to be adjusted based on the loop's effect on them.
   - `h` is updated by adding `curr` to it.
   - `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.

### Updated State:
- `h` remains unchanged because the loop hasn't executed yet (we are determining the state before the next iteration).
- `n` is decreased by `i * curr` where `i` is the next element from the `costs` list.

### Final State:
- `h` is still `h + curr` (unchanged because we are looking at the state before the next iteration).
- `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr` where `i` is the next element from the `costs` list.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `n` based on the next `i` from the `costs` list.

### Example Answer:
State: **`h` is `h + curr`, `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr` where `i` is the next element from the `costs` list**.

To be more specific:
- `h` remains `h + curr`.
- `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr` where `i` is the next element from the `costs` list.

So, the final state can be represented as:
State: **`h` is `h + curr`, `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr` where `i` is the next element from the `costs` list**.
