Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
- `n` is successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient, until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`.
- The final value of `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, and the value of `h` is not explicitly needed to determine the output of the print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
