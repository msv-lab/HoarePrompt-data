You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns the integer n, which is equal to k.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `h` will be the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`. `n` will be reduced by `i * curr` for each iteration until `n` becomes less than the smallest value in `costs`.
    #
    #In more detail, `h` will accumulate the quotient of `n` divided by each element in `costs`, and `n` will be successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient, until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: [list of elements in costs]
    #State: `h` is the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`. `n` is successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient, until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`. If `h` is less than `k` at the end of the process, the function continues as if `h` were less than `k`. Otherwise, the function ensures that `h` is at least `k` after the process completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. If n is equal to k, the function returns the integer n. Otherwise, the function returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer n, which is equal to k.

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
