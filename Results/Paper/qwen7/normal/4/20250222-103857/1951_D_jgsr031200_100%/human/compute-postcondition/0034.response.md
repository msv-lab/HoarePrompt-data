Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1, 1, and then returns n. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the sum of quotients obtained by dividing n by each element in a list [n-k+1, 1], reducing n accordingly. If this sum is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns None; otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and the list [n-k+1, 1].**
