Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `p1 - x > p2 - y`; `y` is decreased by 1.**

This means that `y` has been decreased by 1 from its original value, which was `p3`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
