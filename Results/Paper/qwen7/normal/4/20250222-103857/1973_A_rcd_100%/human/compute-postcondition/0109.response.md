Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last set of values entered by the user for which the loop did not encounter an odd sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and the condition `p3 < p1 + p2` was satisfied. If the loop terminated normally without any odd sums or if all possible inputs led to printing `p3`, then `x` will be 0 and `y` will be equal to `p3`. If the loop terminated due to an odd sum, `x` and `y` will not be updated and their values will depend on the last iteration where the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was checked.
