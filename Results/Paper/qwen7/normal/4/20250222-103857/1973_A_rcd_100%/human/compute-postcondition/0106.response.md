Output State: `x` is either 0 or 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, `y` is at least -2.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will either be 0 or 1 because the loop increments `x` by 1 each time it runs, but once `y` becomes less than `x`, the loop terminates. The variable `y` starts as `p3` and decreases by 1 each iteration of the loop until `y < x`. Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `y` can be at most -2 (if `x` was incremented multiple times before `y` became less than `x`). The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
