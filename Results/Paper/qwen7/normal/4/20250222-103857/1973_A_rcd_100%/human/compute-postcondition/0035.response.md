Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 0. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.**
