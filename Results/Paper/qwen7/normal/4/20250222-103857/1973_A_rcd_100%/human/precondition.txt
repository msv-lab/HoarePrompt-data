p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of three players after playing a series of chess games, where each game results in either a win (2 points for one player, 0 for the other), a loss (0 for the winner, 2 for the loser), or a draw (1 point for each player).
