Output State: **`x` is either 0 or 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, `y` is at least 1 if `x` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `x`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, or `y`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
