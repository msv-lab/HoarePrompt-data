Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` is 1.

However, the values of `p1` and `p3` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since these values are not defined, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we will describe the expression `p1 - x + p3` in terms of `p1` and `p3`.

Given that `x` can be either 0 or 1, the expression `p1 - x + p3` can be simplified as follows:
- If `x = 0`, the expression becomes `p1 + p3`.
- If `x = 1`, the expression becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not provided, we will express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where x is either 0 or 1, and p1 and p3 are undefined variables)**
