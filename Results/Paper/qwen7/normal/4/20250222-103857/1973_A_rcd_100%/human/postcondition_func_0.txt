The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is odd, it prints -1 and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even and \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to \( p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). Otherwise, it finds integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( p_1 - x \leq p_2 - y \) and prints \( p_1 - x + p_3 \). If no valid \( x \) and \( y \) are found, it prints \( p_3 \). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each test case.
