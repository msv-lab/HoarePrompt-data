Output State: `x` is either 0 or 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, `y` is less than or equal to 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, there are two possible scenarios based on the conditions within the loop:

1. The loop breaks out when `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true. In this case, `x` will be either 0 or 1 (depending on how many times the loop iterated), and `y` will be adjusted according to the loop's logic, resulting in `y` being less than or equal to 0.
2. If the loop does not break and goes through all its iterations without finding a condition where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, `x` will be 1 (since it increments by 1 each time until it reaches 1), and `y` will also be 0 because it decreases by 1 each time until it reaches 0.

In both cases, the final state of `x` will be either 0 or 1, and `y` will be less than or equal to 0. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
