Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 if `x` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or if statement is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
