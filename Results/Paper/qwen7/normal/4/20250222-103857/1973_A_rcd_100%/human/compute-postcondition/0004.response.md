Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `-1`. Since there is no dependency on the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, and the print statement does not reference any of these variables, the output is directly `-1`.

Output: **-1**
