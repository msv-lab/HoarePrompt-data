Output State: **`x` is either 2 or 3, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` is at least -1**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by 1. Since `y` must be at least 0 initially, after decrementing, `y` will be at least -1 (if `y` was 0 initially) or remain non-negative if `y` was greater than 1 initially. The values of `x`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
