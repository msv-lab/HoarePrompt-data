Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the loop continues, but since the question focuses on the print statement and does not mention any loop continuation, we assume the print statement is executed.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers entered by the user)**
