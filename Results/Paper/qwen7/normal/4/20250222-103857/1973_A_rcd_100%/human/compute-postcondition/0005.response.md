Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd also remains valid.
