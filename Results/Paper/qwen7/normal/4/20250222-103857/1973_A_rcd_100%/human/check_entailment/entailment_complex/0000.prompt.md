Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last set of values entered by the user for which the loop did not encounter an odd sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and the condition `p3 < p1 + p2` was satisfied. If the loop terminated normally without any odd sums or if all possible inputs led to printing `p3`, then `x` will be 0 and `y` will be equal to `p3`. If the loop terminated due to an odd sum, `x` and `y` will not be updated and their values will depend on the last iteration where the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was checked.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is odd, it prints -1 and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even and \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to \( p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). Otherwise, it finds integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( p_1 - x \leq p_2 - y \) and prints \( p_1 - x + p_3 \). If no valid \( x \) and \( y \) are found, it prints \( p_3 \). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each test case.
