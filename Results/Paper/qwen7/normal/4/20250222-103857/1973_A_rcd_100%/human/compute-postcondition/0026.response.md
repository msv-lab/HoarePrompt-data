Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 2, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 if `x` is 1, `y` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The variable `t` must still be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still integers entered by the user, and they still satisfy the conditions that their sum is even and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. The variable `x` remains either 0 or 2, and `y` is equal to `p3` and must be greater than or equal to 1 if `x` is 1. After executing the code, `y` has been decreased by 1.
