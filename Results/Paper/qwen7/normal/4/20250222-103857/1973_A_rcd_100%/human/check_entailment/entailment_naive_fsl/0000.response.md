Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2`

According to the problem description, if the scores are `1 1 2`, the maximum number of draws would be `2`. This is because the only way to achieve these scores is through two draws (one between the first and second player, and one between the first and third player), resulting in each player having 1 point from the draws and 0 points from any possible losses.

However, the program does not handle this case correctly. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. For the input `1 1 2`, this condition is false.
2. Next, it checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. For `1 1 2`, this condition is true, and it prints `p1 + p2`, which is `2`.

While the program correctly identifies that the scores are consistent, it does not account for the possibility of multiple draws. Specifically, it assumes that the difference between `p3` and `p1 + p2` can be achieved solely through wins and losses, without considering the possibility of additional draws.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly calculate the maximum number of draws. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * p3) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly, handling all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
