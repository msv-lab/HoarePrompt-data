Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last set of values entered by the user for the final iteration of the loop. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` was even during the final iteration, the loop would have printed one of the following outputs based on the conditions inside the loop: `p1 + p2`, `p1 - x + p3`, or `p3`. If the sum was odd, the loop would have continued without printing anything for that iteration. The variables `x` and `y` will be set according to the logic executed in the final iteration, with `x` being either 0 or 1, and `y` being equal to `p3` if the loop printed `p1 - x + p3`, or 0 if the loop printed `p3`.
