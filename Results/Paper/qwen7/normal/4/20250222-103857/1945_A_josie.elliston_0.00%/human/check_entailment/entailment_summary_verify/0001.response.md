### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and its logic. Let's break down the analysis further to ensure completeness and accuracy.

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - The function correctly checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it ensures that there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts. This is done by checking if the remainder of `extroverts % 3` plus the number of universals is at least 3.
   - The calculation `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` is correct for determining the number of tents needed for both extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - The function correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and handles the case where `func_1` returns `None` by returning `-1`.
   - It then adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents required.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no extroverts and universals (`0 0 0`), resulting in `0` tents.
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no universals but some extroverts (`7 0 0`), resulting in `7` tents because each extrovert needs a tent with two others, which is impossible without universals.
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals (`1 4 1`), resulting in `-1` because it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.

4. **General Case**:
   - The general logic in both functions ensures that all participants' preferences are respected and the minimum number of tents is used.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct handling of all edge cases, the original assessment is accurate.
