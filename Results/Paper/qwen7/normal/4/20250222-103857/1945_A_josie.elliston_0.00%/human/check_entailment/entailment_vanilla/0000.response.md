Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum number of tents required for a given number of extroverts and universals.
   - The logic inside the function:
     - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remainder plus the number of universals is less than 3. If true, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required considering the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. It ensures that there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts.
   - The calculation `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` correctly computes the number of tents needed for both extroverts and universals.

2. **Handling of Introverts**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly accounts for the introverts by adding the result from `func_1` to the number of introverts.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, `func_2` correctly returns `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the edge case where there are no extroverts and universals (`0 0 0`), the program correctly outputs `0`.
   - For the edge case where there are no universals but some extroverts (`7 0 0`), the program correctly outputs `7` because each extrovert needs a tent with two others, which is impossible without universals.
   - For the edge case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals (`1 4 1`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **General Case**:
   - The general logic in both functions seems to handle the problem correctly, ensuring that all participants' preferences are respected and the minimum number of tents is used.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
