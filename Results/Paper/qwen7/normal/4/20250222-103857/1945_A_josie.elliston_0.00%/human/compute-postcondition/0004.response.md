Postcondition: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then the condition holds true. If the condition does not hold (i.e., `extroverts` is divisible by 3 or `extroverts % 3 + universals` is less than 3), the postcondition remains as the initial state described in the precondition.
