### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`. If this condition is true, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
   - If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, it means `extroverts` is already divisible by 3, and thus, it directly returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` without further checks.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and assigns the result to `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns `introverts + ret`.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that for every group of 3 people, at least one tent is used. If there are leftover extroverts that cannot form a full group of 3 with available universals, it correctly handles the situation by returning `None` if the condition is not met.
   - `func_2` correctly calculates the total number of tents required by adding the tents needed for extroverts and universals to the number of tents needed for introverts.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The annotated program processes a set of predefined test cases and prints the results using `func_2`.
   - For each test case, the program correctly computes the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when there are no participants (`0 0 0`), only introverts (`7 0 0`), or only extroverts (`0 24 0`).
   - It also handles cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants, such as in the case of `1 4 1` and `1 1 1`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all test cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
