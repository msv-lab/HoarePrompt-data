Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers. If `extroverts` is divisible by 3 or `extroverts % 3 + universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3.**
