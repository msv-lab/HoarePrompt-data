Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, and for each `t`, it has three positive integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, along with a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns different values based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

However, since the specific return values based on the conditions are not provided in the given output, the functionality description focuses on the input structure and the implied processing of the input data.
