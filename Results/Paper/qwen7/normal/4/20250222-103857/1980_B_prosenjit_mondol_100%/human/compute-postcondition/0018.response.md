Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `k` is either `f` (if `a[k] < x`) or `k-1` (if `a[k] >= x`), `x` is either `a[f+1]` (if `a[k] < x`) or `a[f]` (if `a[k] >= x`), and `a[k]` is either less than `x` (if `a[k] < x`) or greater than `x` (if `a[k] >= x`).
