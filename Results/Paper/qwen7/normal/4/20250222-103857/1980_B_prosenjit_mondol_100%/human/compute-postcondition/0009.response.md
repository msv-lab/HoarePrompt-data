Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `k` is `k-1`.
- `x` is equal to `a[f]`.
- The current value of `a[k]` is greater than `x`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated, the output will be exactly as specified.

Output: **NO**
