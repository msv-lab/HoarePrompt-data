Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are a few issues:

1. **Sorting and Indexing**: The program sorts the list `a` in reverse order and then checks if the `k`-th element is greater than the original value of the favorite cube. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether the favorite cube will definitely be removed or not. It should check if the favorite cube is among the first `k+1` elements after sorting.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube might be exactly at the boundary and the next element is equal to the favorite cube's value, which needs careful handling.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1  # Adjusting favorite index to 0-based
        k -= 1  # Adjusting removal count to 0-based
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array in descending order
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        # Check if the favorite cube is among the first k+1 elements after sorting
        if f <= k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # Check if the (k+1)-th element is less than the favorite cube's value
            if k + 1 < n and sorted_a[k + 1] < a[f]:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether the favorite cube will be removed or not based on the given conditions.
