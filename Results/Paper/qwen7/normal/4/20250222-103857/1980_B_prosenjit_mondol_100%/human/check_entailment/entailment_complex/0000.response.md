Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`, and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed.
3. The list `a` is correctly read and sorted in descending order.
4. The logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed is correct:
   - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If `a[k] == x`, it checks further conditions:
     - If `k` is the last index (`n-1`), the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints 'YES'.
     - If the next element `a[k+1]` is less than `x`, the favorite cube is still removed, so it prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the provided logic and the example outputs, the function appears to handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
