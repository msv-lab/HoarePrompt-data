Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\) in range \(n\), `k` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
