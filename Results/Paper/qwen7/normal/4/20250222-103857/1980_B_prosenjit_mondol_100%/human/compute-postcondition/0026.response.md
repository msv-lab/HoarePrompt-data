Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `k` is the third integer input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using map and int, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `f` (which is `second integer input - 1`) in the list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
