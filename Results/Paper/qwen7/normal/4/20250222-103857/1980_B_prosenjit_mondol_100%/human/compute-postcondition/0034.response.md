Output State: **`n` is the new integer input, `f` is the new integer input decreased by 1, `k` is the new integer input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code takes three integers as input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into three parts. These parts are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigned to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated, but the values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
