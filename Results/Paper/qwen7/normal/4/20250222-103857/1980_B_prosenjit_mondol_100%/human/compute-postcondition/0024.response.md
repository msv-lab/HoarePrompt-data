Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `k` is the third integer input decreased by 1**

The code `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. Since `n` and `f` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still the first integer input, `f` is still the second integer input decreased by 1, and `k` is now the third integer input decreased by 1.
