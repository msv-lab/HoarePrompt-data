Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `a` is a list with all leading zeros removed.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the front of the list `a` as long as the first element is zero. After executing the loop as many times as necessary (which could be up to 3 times based on the given information), `a` will no longer have any leading zeros. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop. The variable `res` remains 0 since the loop does not modify it.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `a` does not have its last element as 0 (it is empty)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `a` contains at least one element and its last element is no longer 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `a` contains at least one element and its last element is no longer 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
