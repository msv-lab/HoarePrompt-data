Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all consecutive zeros at the beginning removed, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the start of the list `a` as long as the first element is zero. After all iterations of the loop, `a` will no longer have any leading zeros, and the rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
