Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, excluding any trailing zeros.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` will be a list that starts from the second element of the original list and contains only the non-zero elements, with all trailing zeros removed. The variable `res` remains 0 because it was not modified within the loop.
