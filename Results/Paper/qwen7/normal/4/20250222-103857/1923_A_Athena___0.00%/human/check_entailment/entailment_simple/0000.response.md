Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**: The function removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` but does not account for the number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block. The logic should focus on moving each chip to the nearest free cell to the left, which is not achieved by simply counting zeros.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, and the function does not implement this logic. Instead, it just counts the number of zeros, which is not relevant to the solution.

3. **Output Calculation**: The function prints the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros but does not calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the expected output is `1` because moving the chip from the 7th position to the 5th position forms a single block.
   - For the input `6 0 1 0 0 0 0`, the expected output is `0` because all chips are already in a single block.
   - For the input `6 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the expected output is `0` because all chips are already in a single block.
   - For the input `5 1 0 1 0 1`, the expected output is `2` because moving the chips from positions 2 and 4 to the left forms a single block.
   - For the input `9 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`, the expected output is `3` because moving the chips from positions 2, 5, and 8 to the left forms a single block.

Given these points, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
