Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last two elements are 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, removing it leaves the second-to-last element as the new last element, which is also 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
