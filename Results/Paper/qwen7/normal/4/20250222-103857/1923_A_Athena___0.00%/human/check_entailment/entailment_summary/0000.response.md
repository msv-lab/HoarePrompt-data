Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Moving Chips**: The program does not simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros. This does not reflect the actual movement of chips required to form a single block.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the modified list `a` and the count of zeros after removing leading and trailing zeros. However, this does not give the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

3. **No Simulation of Chip Movements**: The program lacks the logic to actually move chips step-by-step according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

4. **Zero Count is Not Minimized**: The zero count printed is not the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal.

Given these points, the program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
