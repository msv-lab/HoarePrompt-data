Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 1, `count` is 0, `s` is the input string, `flag` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, the current value of `i` is such that the character at position `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `i + 1` in `s`, and `len(s)` must be at least 2**
