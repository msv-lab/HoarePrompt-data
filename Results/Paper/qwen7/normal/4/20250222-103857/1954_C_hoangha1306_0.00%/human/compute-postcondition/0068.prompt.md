Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `kq1` is an empty string, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input integer, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index, `kq2` is a string that either contains the value of `x` or is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index, and `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1`, `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of `y` (which is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) to its current value, `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1` where `n` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1`. `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` to its current value. `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0. `i` is `n + 2`, where `n` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq2` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i]` to its previous value. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the value of `vt`: if `vt == 0` and `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` (minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i]))` and `kq2` by appending the string representation of `y` (maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i]))`. If `vt == 0` and `a[i] <= b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` and `kq2` by appending the string representation of `x`. If `vt != 0`, `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
