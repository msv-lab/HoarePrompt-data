Output State: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`**

The initial state of `vt` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `kq1` is updated by concatenating its current value (which is `kq1`) with the string representation of `y`. Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we represent the new value of `kq1` as the concatenation of its original value with `str(y)`.
