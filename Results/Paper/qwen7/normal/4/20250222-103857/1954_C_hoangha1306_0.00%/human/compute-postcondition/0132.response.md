Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)` + 1, `kq1` is updated to include either the string representation of the minimum or the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` based on the if condition, `kq2` is updated to include either the string representation of the maximum or the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` based on the if condition, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1.
