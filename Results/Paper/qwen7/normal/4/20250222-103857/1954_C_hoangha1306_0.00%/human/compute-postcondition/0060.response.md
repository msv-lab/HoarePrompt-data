Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value, `vt` is 1, `i` is `n + 2`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` updates the string `kq1` by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
