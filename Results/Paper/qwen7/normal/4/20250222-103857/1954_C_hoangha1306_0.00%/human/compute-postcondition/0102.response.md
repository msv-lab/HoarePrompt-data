Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is an input string, `kq1` is a string, `kq2` is a string, `vt` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `b` is an input string, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0])).

- If `vt == 0`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. `kq1` is either the concatenation of `kq1` with the string representation of `x` or the character `y` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. `kq2` is either the concatenation of `kq2` with the string representation of `y` or the string `str(x)`. `vt` is set to 1, and `q` is incremented by 1.
- If `vt != 0`, then `i` is 0. `kq1` is the concatenation of the current value of `kq1` and the maximum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers. `kq2` is the concatenation of itself and the minimum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers. `vt` remains 0, and `q` is incremented by 1.
