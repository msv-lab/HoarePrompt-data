Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `kq1` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value with either `str(x)` or `str(y)` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq2` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value with either `str(y)` or `str(x)` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
