Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, `kq1` will be a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `a` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and for the cases where `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq1` will contain the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `kq2` will be a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `a` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and for the cases where `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq2` will contain the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` if `vt == 0` and `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise it will contain the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. The variable `vt` will be set to 1 or will not be equal to 0, and `i` will be equal to `len(a)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `kq1` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters from `a` where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` or the minimum value of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq2` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters from `a` where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` or the maximum value of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. `kq1` and `kq2` will contain strings formed based on the comparisons between characters of `a` and `b`. Specifically, `kq1` will concatenate the character from `a` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, or the smaller of the two characters converted to integers if they differ. Conversely, `kq2` will concatenate the larger of the two characters converted to integers under the same conditions. `vt` will be 1, indicating that the loop has run at least once and adjusted the values accordingly. `q` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration and will be less than `t` after the loop completes. `b` remains the newly input string, and `a` remains the input string from the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
