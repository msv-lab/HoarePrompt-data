The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, we assume that the `continue` statement is part of a loop that was previously defined. However, the `continue` statement itself does not change any variable values or add new information about the state. It simply skips to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the variables remain in their previous states, except that the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing the remaining code within the current iteration.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`, `kq2` is unchanged, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is `q + 1` and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
