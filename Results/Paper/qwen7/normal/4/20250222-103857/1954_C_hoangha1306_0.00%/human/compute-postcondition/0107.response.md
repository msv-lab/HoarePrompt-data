Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and `a[i]`, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and `a[i]`, `kq2` is a string, `vt` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string and we continue the loop.**

This output state indicates that the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next one without changing the values of the variables. The conditions for `i` and `q` remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
