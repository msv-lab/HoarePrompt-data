Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `len(a)` remains the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]` and `kq2` remains unchanged. If they are not equal, `kq1` is updated to either 'None' followed by the string representations of `x` and `y` (if `vt` was 0) or the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. Similarly, `kq2` is updated to either the string representations of `y` and `x` (if `vt` was 0) or the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.**
