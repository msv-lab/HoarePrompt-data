### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice starts by appending elements to her array `c` and removing them from `a`.
   - Bob removes elements directly from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing integer (MEX).
   - The logic in the loop does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It assumes that the first occurrence of a unique element will be picked by Alice, and subsequent unique elements will be picked by Bob.
   - However, the optimal strategy involves more complex decision-making based on the counts and turns.
   - The code does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should try to include the smallest numbers in `c` by picking them first.
   - Bob should remove these smallest numbers to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The optimal solution involves counting the occurrences and determining the MEX based on the parity of the counts.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Alice should aim to include the smallest numbers in `c` by picking them first.
   - Bob should remove these smallest numbers to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The optimal solution involves counting the occurrences and determining the MEX based on the parity of the counts.

6. **Evaluation of the Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code explains that the function prints the first missing positive integer in the array `arr`.
   - This is not the same as finding the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.
   - The annotated code does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
