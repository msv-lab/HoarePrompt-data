Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve a different problem than the one described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program tries to find the first missing positive integer in the array \(a\), whereas the actual problem requires determining the MEX of the array \(c\) after both players have played optimally.

Let's break down the differences:

1. **Objective**: The program aims to find the first missing positive integer in the array \(a\), while the problem requires finding the MEX of the array \(c\) formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
2. **Gameplay Simulation**: The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to modify arrays \(a\) and \(c\) according to the rules specified. Instead, it directly computes the MEX of the entire array \(a\) without considering the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob.
3. **Output**: The output of the program is the first missing positive integer in the array \(a\), which does not align with the required output of the MEX of the array \(c\).

Given these discrepancies, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
