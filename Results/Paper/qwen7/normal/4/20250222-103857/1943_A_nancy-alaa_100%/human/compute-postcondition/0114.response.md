Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The key point here is that `i` is incremented until it reaches `n + 1` or until `i` is found in `mpp.keys()`, at which point the loop or if statement breaks, and `i` does not get incremented further.

Given that `i` is set to the previous value of `i` + 1 and the loop breaks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the value of `i` that gets printed will be the last value of `i` before the loop or if statement breaks.

Since no specific value for `i` or `n` is provided, and no details about `mpp` are given, the most precise description we can give is that `i` will be the value that causes the loop or if statement to break.

Output: **i (where i is the last value before breaking out of the loop or if statement)**
