Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- The current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, it implies that `i` is not one of the integers present in the list `arr`. There is no explicit value given for `i`, so we cannot determine its exact value from the provided information. However, we know that `i` is a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` itself, which is a non-negative integer but its specific value is unknown based on the given information.

Output: **i (where i is a non-negative integer)**
