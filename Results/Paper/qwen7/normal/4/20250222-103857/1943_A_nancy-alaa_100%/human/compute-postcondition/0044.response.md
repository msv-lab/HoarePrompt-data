Output State: `first` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n`. The variable `first` remains `True` unless `mpp[i]` equals 1 during any iteration, which would make it `False`. Since the loop does not change `n`, `arr`, or `mpp` except for the condition checks, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
