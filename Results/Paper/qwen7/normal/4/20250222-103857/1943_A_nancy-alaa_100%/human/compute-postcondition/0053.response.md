Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `first`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, or `i`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial state specifies that the current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp`, and no operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet, their states remain unchanged.
