Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

The code snippet `print(i)` will print the value of `i`.

Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` will be a positive integer starting from 1 if `n` is 0, or from `n + 1` if `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **i (where i is n + 1, and n is a non-negative integer)**
