Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged.
