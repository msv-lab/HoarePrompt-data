Postcondition: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1`, and after executing the if-else block, if `i` is not a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
