Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

The code `first = False` simply changes the value of the variable `first` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
