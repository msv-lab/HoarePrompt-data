Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`, which means it hasn't been set to `True` yet.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not initialized before this operation, it implies that `i` is being incremented by 1 without any prior value. Typically, in such cases, `i` would be `0` before this increment if no other initialization is done.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1`, and assuming `i` starts at `0` (the typical default), `i` will be `1` after this operation.

Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
