Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `i` is `q + 1`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, and the condition `a < b < c` holds true.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts maintain the same conditions as the precondition. The if condition `a < b > c` is not satisfied (since the precondition already states `a < b < c`), so the else part is executed, but the conditions do not change.
