Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair and a peak. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly implemented. The current implementation uses a single `if` statement for both conditions, which will cause the program to print "STAIR" or "PEAK" for both conditions if either of them is met, instead of checking both conditions separately.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
```
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
PEAK
```

Actual Output:
```
STAIR
```

The program should check both conditions independently and print "PEAK" since `1 < 3 > 2`. However, due to the current implementation, it incorrectly prints "STAIR" because the first condition `a < b < c` is not met, but the second condition `a < b > c` is also not met, so it defaults to printing "STAIR" without considering the correct condition.
