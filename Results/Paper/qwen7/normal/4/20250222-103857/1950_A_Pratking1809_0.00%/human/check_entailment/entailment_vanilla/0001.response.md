### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates through each test case.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100, which is not used in the program. This can be removed as it does not affect the logic.
3. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
5. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
6. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a logical issue with the way the conditions are checked. Specifically, the conditions should be mutually exclusive, but the current implementation will print 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' even if both conditions are true for the same test case. This is because the conditions are checked sequentially, and the second condition (`a < b > c`) will always evaluate to false if `a < b < c` is true.

To fix this, we need to ensure that only one of the conditions is checked at a time, and the other is skipped if the first condition is true.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical flaw due to the sequential checking of conditions without proper mutual exclusivity. After fixing this, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
