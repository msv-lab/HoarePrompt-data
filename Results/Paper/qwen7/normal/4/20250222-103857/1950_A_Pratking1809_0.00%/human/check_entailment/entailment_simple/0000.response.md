### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`q`) and then iterates over each test case, reading three digits (`a`, `b`, `c`) for each case.
   
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - For each set of digits, the program checks if they form a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR" if true.
   - It also checks if they form a peak (`a < b > c`) and prints "PEAK" if true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs exactly `q` times, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

4. **Output**: The output matches the expected format, with "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" printed for each test case.

5. **Variable Usage**: The variables `mn`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are used appropriately within the loop but do not affect the logic of determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like `0 0 0` correctly by printing "NONE".

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Correctness:
**True**
