Output State: **`i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`; `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. Here, `i` remains the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`, and `ans` is updated based on the value of `hmp[i]`. The initial conditions that `ans` is updated based on the value of `hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m` are still valid, but now `ans` has been updated by the specified amount.
