Output State: **`t` is reduced by 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the count of each character in the string `s`**.

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `ans`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
