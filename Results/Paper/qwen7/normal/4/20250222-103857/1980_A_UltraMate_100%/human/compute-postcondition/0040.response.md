Output State: **`t` is reduced by 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**.

The code `p = 'ABCDEFG'` assigns the string 'ABCDEFG' to the variable `p`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, or `ans`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
