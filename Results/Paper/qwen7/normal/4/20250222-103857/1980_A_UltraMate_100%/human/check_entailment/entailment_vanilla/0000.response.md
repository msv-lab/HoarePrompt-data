### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can conduct `m` rounds.
   - Each round requires at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - We have an initial set of `n` problems with their respective difficulties stored in a string `s`.

2. **Key Steps in the Code:**
   - **Reading Input:** 
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, read `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
   - **Counting Existing Problems:**
     - Use `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - **Calculating Missing Problems:**
     - Iterate over each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and check if it is missing from the counter.
     - If a difficulty level is missing, add `m` to the answer since Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
     - If a difficulty level exists but its count is less than `m`, calculate the difference and add it to the answer.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the missing and insufficient problems.
   - It ensures that for each required difficulty level, the minimum number of additional problems needed is calculated accurately.
   - The code handles all edge cases where certain difficulty levels might be completely missing or insufficient.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles scenarios where some difficulty levels are missing entirely.
   - It also correctly calculates when the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create.

**Correctness: True**
