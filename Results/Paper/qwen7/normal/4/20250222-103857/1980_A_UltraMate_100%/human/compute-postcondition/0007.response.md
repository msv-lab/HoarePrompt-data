Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which iterates over the string `p`.

2. **Understand the structure of `p`**: The string `p` is given as `'ABCDEFG'`. This means `i` will take on the values 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G' during the iterations of the loop.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop is about to start, `i` will be set to the first character of `p`, which is 'A'.

4. **List the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, which is derived from the string `p`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` starts with the first character of `p` ('A') for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is initialized to the first character of `p`.

**State:**
**`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
