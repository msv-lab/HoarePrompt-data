Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the dictionary `hmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `hmp`. The final value of `i` after all iterations is specified as the last character in the string 'ABCDEFG'.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the keys of `hmp`, and the final value of `i` is 'G', `i` must start from one of the keys in `hmp` and progress through the keys until it reaches 'G'. 

4. **Understand the State of `hmp`**: `hmp` is a dictionary representing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. The exact contents of `hmp` are not specified, but we know that the loop will iterate over its keys.

5. **Consider the Final State of `ans`**: `ans` is increased by `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not found in `hmp`. This implies that `hmp` must contain some subset of the characters in 'ABCDEFG'.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must start from one of the keys in `hmp` and proceed to 'G'.
   - `hmp` must contain the keys corresponding to the characters in 'ABCDEFG' up to 'G'.
   - `ans` must be initialized appropriately, but since the exact initial value is not given, we focus on the conditions for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `hmp`.

**State:**
- `i` must start from one of the keys in `hmp` and eventually become 'G'.
- `hmp` must contain the keys corresponding to the characters in 'ABCDEFG' up to 'G'.

Thus, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` must start from one of the keys in `hmp` and eventually become 'G', `hmp` must contain the keys corresponding to the characters in 'ABCDEFG' up to 'G'**.
