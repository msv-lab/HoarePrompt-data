Output State: **`i` becomes 'G', `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` starts from one of the keys in `hmp` and eventually becomes 'G'. The value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. After executing the line `ans += m - hmp[i]`, the value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the current value of `hmp[i]`. Since `i` becomes 'G', the output state reflects this change and the updated value of `ans`.
