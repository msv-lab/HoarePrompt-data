The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and a string \(a\) of length \(n\) containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates and prints the total number of additional occurrences needed for each character in 'ABCDEFG' to reach at least \(m\) occurrences across all strings in the test cases. Specifically, for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not present in any string, it adds \(m\) to the count. For characters present but with fewer than \(m\) occurrences, it adds the difference \(m - \text{occurrences}\). The final output is the sum of these adjustments for all test cases.
