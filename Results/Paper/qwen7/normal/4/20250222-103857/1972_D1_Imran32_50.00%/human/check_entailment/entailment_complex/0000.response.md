Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()`.
- In `func_1()`, the program reads `n` and `k` (which should be `m` in the context of the problem statement) and initializes `ans` with the value of `n`.
- The program then iterates from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, adding `(n + i) // i^2` to `ans` for each `i` in this range.
- Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

However, there is a discrepancy between the problem statement and the implementation:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The current implementation does not account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)). Instead, it incorrectly calculates a sum related to the square root of `n`.

Given these discrepancies, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
