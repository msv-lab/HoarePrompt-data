Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, we need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given program does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates the number of multiples of certain values within the range up to \(n\). This approach is completely unrelated to the problem statement and will not produce the correct results for any input.

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The correct pairs that satisfy the condition are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- The program, however, counts the number of multiples of certain values, which does not match the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
