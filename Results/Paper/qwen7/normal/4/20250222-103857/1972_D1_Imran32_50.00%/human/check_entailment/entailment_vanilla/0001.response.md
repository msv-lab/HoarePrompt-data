Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - There is a function `func_1()` defined, but it is not used in the main loop where the test cases are processed. This suggests that `func_1()` is not correctly implemented or used for the intended purpose.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1()` is called with `k` instead of `m`, which is incorrect because `k` is not defined in the input.

4. **Function `func_1()` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1()` calculates `ans` as `n`.
   - It then iterates from `2` to `root + 1` (where `root` is the square root of `n`).
   - For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Problem Requirements:**
  - We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

- **Current Implementation:**
  - The current implementation does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
  - The function `func_1()` does not use `m` at all and only uses `n`, which is incorrect.
  - The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
