Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The main issue lies in the calculation of `ans`. According to the problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the program calculates `ans` as `n` plus a sum involving \(i^2\), which has no relation to the required conditions. Specifically, the loop iterates over values of \(i\) from 2 to the square root of \(n\) and adds \((n + i) // i^2\) to `ans`, which is irrelevant to the problem constraints.

Given this mismatch between the intended logic and the actual implementation, the program does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
