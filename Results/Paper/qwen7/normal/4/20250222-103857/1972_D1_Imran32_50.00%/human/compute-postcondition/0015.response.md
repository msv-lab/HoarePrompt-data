Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function ensures that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, with the total sum of n and m across all test cases not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function then performs some unspecified operations based on n and m and returns the results accordingly for each test case.**
