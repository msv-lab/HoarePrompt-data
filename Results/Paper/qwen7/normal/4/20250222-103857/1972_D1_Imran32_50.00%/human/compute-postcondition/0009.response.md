Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `root`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `2` to `root + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the state changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated by adding the value of `(n + i) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1))`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
   - `cnt` is set to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` (let's call this new value `i_new`).
   - For the loop to continue, `root` must still be greater than or equal to `i_new + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it is not directly modified by the loop itself but by the loop body.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` (since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1))`, `i` is `i + 2`, `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`**
