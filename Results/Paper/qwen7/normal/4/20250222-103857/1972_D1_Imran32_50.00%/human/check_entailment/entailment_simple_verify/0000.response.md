### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`:
   - It reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
   - Initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - Computes the square root of \(n\) and iterates from 2 to this value.
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // i^2\) to `ans`.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a different calculation involving the square root of \(n\) and the division of \(n + i\) by \(i^2\).
2. **Mismatched Variables**: In the function, \(k\) is used instead of \(m\), which could lead to confusion but does not affect the core logic.
3. **Irrelevant Loop**: The loop iterating from 2 to the square root of \(n\) does not relate to the problem constraints.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the example provided in the problem description:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - Correct pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\)
  - Expected output: 3

Running the given program with \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
- The program calculates \((2 + i) // i^2\) for \(i = 2\):
  - For \(i = 2\): \((2 + 2) // 2^2 = 4 // 4 = 1\)
  - Initial `ans` is 2, so `ans` becomes 3.
- Output: 3

While the output matches the expected result for this specific example, the program still does not follow the correct logic for the general case. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It performs a different calculation and does not check the required condition. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
