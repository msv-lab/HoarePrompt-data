Output State: The value of `ans` will be the sum of its initial value plus the sum of \((n + i) // cnt\) for each \(i\) from 2 to the final value of `root - 1`.

To understand this, let's break down the loop process:

1. Initially, `ans` starts as `n`.
2. For each iteration of the loop, starting with `i = 2` up to the largest integer less than or equal to `root - 1`, the value of `ans` is incremented by \((n + i) // cnt\), where `cnt` is set to \(i * i\).

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the general form of the loop's operation:

- After 1 iteration: `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`
- After 2 iterations: `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // (2 * 2) + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`
- After 3 iterations: `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // (2 * 2) + (n + 3) // (3 * 3) + (n + 5) // (4 * 4)`

Following this pattern, the final output state after all iterations will be:

\[ \text{Output State: } ans = n + \sum_{i=2}^{root-1} \left(\frac{n + i}{i * i}\right) \]

This means `ans` will be the initial value `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` from 2 to the largest integer less than or equal to `root - 1`.
