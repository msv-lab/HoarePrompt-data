Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // (i)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `cnt = i * i` calculates the square of the current value of `i` and assigns it to `cnt`. Since `i` was previously updated to `i + 1`, the new value of `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `root`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
