Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(ans\) as the initial value of \(n\) plus the sum of \((n + i) // i^2\) for each integer \(i\) from 2 to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to \(n\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(ans\) for each test case.**
