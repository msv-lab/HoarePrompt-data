### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program, however, does not perform this calculation at all. Instead, it calculates the number of multiples of certain values within the range up to \(n\), which is unrelated to the problem requirements.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem description), and it calculates \(ans\) as the initial value of \(n\) plus the sum of \((n + i) // i^2\) for each integer \(i\) from 2 to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to \(n\).
   - This calculation is not related to the problem's requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - Correct pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\).
     - The program's output for this input is incorrect because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these points, the program does not implement the required logic and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
