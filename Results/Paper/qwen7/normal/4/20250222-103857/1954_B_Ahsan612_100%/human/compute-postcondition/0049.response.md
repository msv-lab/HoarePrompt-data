Output State: **the number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the remaining number of iterations as input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `ar`. The variable `n` is updated to be the length of this list, which is the number of elements (integers) entered by the user.
