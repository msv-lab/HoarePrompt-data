Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `minn` is infinity.
   - The number of iterations left is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.

3. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is currently 1) must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - If `i` is 1, then `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**.
