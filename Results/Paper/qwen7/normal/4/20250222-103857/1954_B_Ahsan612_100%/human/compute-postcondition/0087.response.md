Postcondition: **The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1, `same` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `minn` is not equal to infinity and is also not equal to the length of `ar`.**
