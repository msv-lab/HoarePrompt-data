Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `same` being explicitly set to 1.
