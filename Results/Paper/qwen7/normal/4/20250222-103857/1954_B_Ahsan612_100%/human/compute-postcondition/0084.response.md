Output State: **The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1, `same` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`. Since `same` represents the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, and `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, the updated `minn` will be the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged.
