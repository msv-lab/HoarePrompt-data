Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, which means `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`).
- `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value, where `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of the list `ar`.

The value of `minn` is determined by comparing it with the current `same` value. Since `same` is a non-negative integer and `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of the list `ar`, `minn` will be the smaller of these two values.

Given this information, the value of `minn` will be either the previous value of `minn` (if it was already smaller than `same`) or the value of `same` (if `same` is smaller).

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between the previous minn and the current same value, and is neither infinity nor equal to the length of the list ar)**
