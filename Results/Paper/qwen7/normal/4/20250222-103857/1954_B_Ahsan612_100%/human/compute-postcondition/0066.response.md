Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions that the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num` and that `i` must be less than `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions still apply after the code execution.
