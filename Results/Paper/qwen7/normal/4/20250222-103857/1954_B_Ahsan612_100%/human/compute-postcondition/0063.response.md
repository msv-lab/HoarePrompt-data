Output State: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` indicates whether the first element `num` appears consecutively, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
