Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `len(ar)`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 and was less than `len(ar)` before this line of code, `i` remains incremented by 1 and is still less than `len(ar)`. The value of `num` is now set to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`.
