Postcondition: `minn` is 1, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 3 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `i` is either 6 or 7, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `num` is equal to `ar[0]` if `ar[i]` does not equal `num`, otherwise `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.
