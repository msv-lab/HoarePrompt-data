Output State: **`minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `minn` to `inf` (infinity). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
