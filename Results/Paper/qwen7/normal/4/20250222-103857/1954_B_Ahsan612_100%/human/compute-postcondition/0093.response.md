Output State: **The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `minn` is either infinity, the length of the list `ar`, or the minimum of `minn` and `same`, unless `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar`, in which case `minn` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
