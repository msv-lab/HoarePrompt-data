Output State: **the number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Since `ar` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` now holds the value of the first integer from the input. The number of iterations left, `n`, and the variable `same` remain unchanged.
