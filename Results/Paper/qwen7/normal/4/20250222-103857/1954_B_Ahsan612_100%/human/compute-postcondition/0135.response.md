Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `minn` will hold the minimum value of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array `ar`. `same` will be 1 because it is reset to 1 at the start of each new sequence of identical elements. `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, indicating that the entire array has been processed. `num` will be the last element of the array `ar` that was checked before the loop ended. If `minn` was never updated during the loop or was set to infinity initially, `minn` will still be infinity. Otherwise, `minn` will be the smallest value among the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical elements found in the array.

The output will be `-1` if `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the array, indicating that there are no sequences of consecutive identical elements. Otherwise, the output will be the value of `minn`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array.
