Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); the number of iterations left is 0; `n` is an input integer; `same` is 2; `i` is now 4; `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user; `num` is equal to `ar[0]; ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `same` is incremented by 1. Since `same` was initially 1, after executing `same += 1`, the value of `same` becomes 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
