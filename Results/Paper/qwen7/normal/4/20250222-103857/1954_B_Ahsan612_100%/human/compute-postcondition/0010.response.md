Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
