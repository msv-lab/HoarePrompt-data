Output State: `minn` is the minimum value encountered during the loop, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is the last index of the list `ar` plus one, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]` if there were no consecutive duplicates of `num` found, otherwise it is the last duplicate found.

This final state means that after all iterations of the loop, `minn` holds the smallest count of consecutive duplicates of any integer in the list `ar`. The variable `i` will be one more than the length of `ar`, indicating the loop has completed. The other variables (`same`, `num`) will reflect the state when the loop terminated, with `same` being 1 unless there was a sequence of duplicates at the end of the list, and `num` will be the last integer in the list if it wasn't part of a longer sequence of duplicates.
