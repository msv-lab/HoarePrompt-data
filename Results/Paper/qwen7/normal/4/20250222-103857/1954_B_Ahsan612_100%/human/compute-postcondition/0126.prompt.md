Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `i` is 3, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1); the number of iterations left is 0; `n` is an input integer; `same` is 2; `i` is now 5; `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user; `num` is equal to `ar[0]`; `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `minn` is 1, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 3 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `i` is either 7 or 8, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `num` is equal to `ar[0]` if `ar[i]` does not equal `num`, otherwise `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
