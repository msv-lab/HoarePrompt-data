Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`same`, which is 1) and the value of `same` (which is also 1). Since both values are the same, `minn` remains unchanged and is still 1. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
