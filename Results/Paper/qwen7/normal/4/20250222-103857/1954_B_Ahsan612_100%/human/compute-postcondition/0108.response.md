Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1).
   - The number of iterations left is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.
   - `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4 and the condition `i < len(ar)` must still hold true.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop condition is met.

**State:**
- `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1).
- The number of iterations left is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`.
- `i` is now 4.
- `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `num` is equal to `ar[0]`.
- `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is 1), the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**.
