Output State: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will reset to 0 when the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is met, which increments `cnt`. The loop processes each character in the string `s`, and once all characters are processed, `cur` will be 0 again, and `cnt` will hold the total count of how many times the condition was satisfied during the loop's execution.
