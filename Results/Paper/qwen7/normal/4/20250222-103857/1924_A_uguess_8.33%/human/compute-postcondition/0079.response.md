Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` (which is the same as before), `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` evaluates to 0, then `cur` remains unchanged.**
