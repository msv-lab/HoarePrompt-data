Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 2, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.
