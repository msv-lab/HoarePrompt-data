Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `cur` to 0 without affecting the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their respective values, plus the new value of `cur`.
