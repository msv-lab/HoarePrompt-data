Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `t` is either `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, and `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed. Otherwise, `i` is the length of the input string `s` + `k`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp`, and `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp` + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1).**
