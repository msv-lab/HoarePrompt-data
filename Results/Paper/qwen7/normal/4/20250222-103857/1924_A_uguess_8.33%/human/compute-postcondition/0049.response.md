Output State: **`i` is length(s) + 1, `cur` is such that when shifted left by (length(s) + 1) bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` to be the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + i`. Given that `i` is `length(s) + 1`, `tmp` becomes the character at index `ord('a') + (length(s) + 1)`. The values of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged.
