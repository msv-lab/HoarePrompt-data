Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', and `cnt` is increased by 1 if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\).**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by \(2^{cur_ss}\). Here, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new string `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. The value of `s` remains unchanged, but `cur` is updated to `cur + 2^{cur_ss}`. The condition for increasing `cnt` by 1 (if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\)) is not checked here, so `cnt` remains as it was before the operation.
