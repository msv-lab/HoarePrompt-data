Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is either `cur + 1 << cur_ss` if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true, or `cur` remains unchanged if the condition is false, where `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**
