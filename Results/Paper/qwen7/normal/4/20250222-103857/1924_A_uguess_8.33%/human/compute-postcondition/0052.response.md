Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the range function.
   - There are no other variables directly controlled by the loop itself.

2. **Understand the Initial Conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `length(s) + 1`.
   - `cur` is such that when shifted left by `(length(s) + 1)` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0.
   - `tmp` is the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + i`, if `cur` is not set to 0 at the `i`-th bit.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `length(s) + 2`.

4. **Check the Condition for `cur`:**
   - Since `cur` is checked based on the value of `i`, and `i` is now `length(s) + 2`, we need to ensure that the condition for `cur` holds true for this new value of `i`.

5. **Determine the Value of `tmp`:**
   - `tmp` is calculated as `ord('a') + i`.
   - With `i` being `length(s) + 2`, `tmp` will be `ord('a') + (length(s) + 2)`.

6. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be `length(s) + 2`.
   - `cur` should still satisfy the condition when shifted left by `(length(s) + 2)` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, resulting in 0.
   - `tmp` will be `ord('a') + (length(s) + 2)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `length(s) + 2`, `cur` is such that when shifted left by `(length(s) + 2)` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + (length(s) + 2)`**.
