Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `for ss in s:`.
2. **Determine the objects involved in the loop head**: The objects involved are `ss` and `s`.
3. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `t` must be at least 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers entered by the user
   - `s` is a string input by the user
   - `cur` is 0

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, `ss` will take on each character of `s` in sequence.
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `s`. Specifically, `s` must be a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string**
