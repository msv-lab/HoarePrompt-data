Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. It does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, `cnt`, or `cur`. Therefore, `i` remains the length of the input string `s`, `t` retains its original form of being `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `cnt` remains 3, and `cur` remains 0.
