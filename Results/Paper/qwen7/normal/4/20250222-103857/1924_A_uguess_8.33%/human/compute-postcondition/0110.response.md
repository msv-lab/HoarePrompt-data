Output State: **`i` is `ord('a') + i + 1`, `k` is the same, `tmp` is 'a'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value `ord('a') + i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially `ord('a') + i + 1`, the expression `ord('a') + i` simplifies to `ord('a') + (ord('a') + i + 1) + 1 - 1 = ord('a') + ord('a') + i + 1 = 2 * ord('a') + i + 1 - 1 = 2 * ord('a') + i`. Since `ord('a')` is 97, `2 * ord('a') + i` is `194 + i`. However, since `i` itself is already `ord('a') + i + 1`, substituting `i` in the expression gives `194 + (97 + i + 1) - 1 = 291 + i`. This results in `tmp` being assigned the character 'a', as the expression evaluates to 97, which is the ASCII value for 'a'. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
