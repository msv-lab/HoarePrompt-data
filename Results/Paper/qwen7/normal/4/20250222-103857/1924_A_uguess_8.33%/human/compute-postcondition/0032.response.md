Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `0`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously increased by 1 if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), the condition for incrementing `cnt` remains the same. All other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
