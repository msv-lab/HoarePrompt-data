You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`. `t` is reduced by a total of 15 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is reduced by 9. `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1` if `cnt` is less than `n`, and `0` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed. `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. `tmp` holds the character 'a' if `cnt` is less than `n`, and is empty if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `ans` is constructed as follows: if `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times plus `tmp` plus 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is simply 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to check all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Instead, it uses a bitmask approach to track the presence of each character in the string `s`, which is insufficient to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

The program outputs:

```
YES
NO
NO
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
YES
NO
NO
aa
ccc
```

The program incorrectly prints "YES" for the second and third test cases because it does not properly check all possible subsequences of length `n`. It only checks if a specific combination of characters exists in the string `s`, but it does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if they are subsequences of `s`. This requires a more comprehensive approach, such as generating all combinations and verifying each one.
