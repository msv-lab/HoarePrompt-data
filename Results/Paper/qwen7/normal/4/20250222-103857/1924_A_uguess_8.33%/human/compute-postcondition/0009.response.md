Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'; `cur` is `cur` plus 1 left-shifted by `cur_ss`.**

Explanation: The code increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`, which means `cur` is increased by 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`. The value of `cur_ss` remains unchanged as it is just used as an index for the bitwise operation. The other variables (`s`) remain in their initial state.
