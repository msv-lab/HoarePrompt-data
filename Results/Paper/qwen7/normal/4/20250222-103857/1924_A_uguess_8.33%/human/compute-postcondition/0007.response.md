Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'**.

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the first character of the string `s` and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from it. The result is stored in `cur_ss`. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
