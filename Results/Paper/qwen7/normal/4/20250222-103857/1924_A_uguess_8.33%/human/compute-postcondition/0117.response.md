Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `t` is further decremented by 6. Otherwise, `i` becomes `ord('a') + k - 1`, `k` remains the same, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is equal to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.**
