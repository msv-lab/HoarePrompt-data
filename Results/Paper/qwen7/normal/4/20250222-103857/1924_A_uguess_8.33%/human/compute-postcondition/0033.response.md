Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0. The values of `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states. `s` is still a non-empty string without its first character, `cur_ss` is still the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', and `cnt` is increased by 1.
