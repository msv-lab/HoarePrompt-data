Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, and the current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set to 1, in which case `tmp` is set to 'a' + `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the length of the input string `s` + 1, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, and if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set to 1, then `tmp` is 'a' + `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the length of the input string `s` + 2; `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`; `tmp` is 'c'. If `cur & 1 << i` evaluates to 0, then no change is made to `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
