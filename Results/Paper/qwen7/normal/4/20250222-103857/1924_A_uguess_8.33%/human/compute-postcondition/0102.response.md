Output State: **`i` must be less than `k`, and the current value of `cur` is such that `cur & 1 << i` equals 0; `tmp` is 'a' if `i` is 0, 'b' if `i` is 1, and so on.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus `i` to the variable `tmp`. Since `i` must be less than `k` and `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, `i` is a valid index for the character calculation. The value of `tmp` will be a lowercase letter starting from 'a' up to 'a' + `i` - 1. The conditions about `i` being less than `k` and the bitwise operation remain unchanged.
