Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is either the original value or the original value plus \(2^{cur_ss}\), `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their previous values according to the initial state.
