Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 4, `cur` is either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 3, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
