Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is updated to `cur | (1 << cur_ss)` if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**
