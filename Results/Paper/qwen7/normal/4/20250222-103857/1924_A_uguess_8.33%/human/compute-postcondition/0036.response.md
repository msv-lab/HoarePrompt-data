Output State: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed; `cur` is either \((1 << k) - 1\) or 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\); `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s`; `t` remains at least 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` retain their initial values.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the string `s` will have been fully processed character by character. The variable `cur` will either hold the value \((1 << k) - 1\) (indicating that all bits up to \(k-1\) are set) or 0 (if no complete set of bits up to \(k-1\) was formed). The counter `cnt` will be incremented each time `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), indicating how many times a full set of bits up to \(k-1\) was achieved. The index `i` will be equal to the length of the original string `s` since it increments by 1 with each iteration. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
