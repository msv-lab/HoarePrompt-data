Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is the original value plus \(2^{cur_ss}\), `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged if `cur` does not equal \(2^k - 1\)**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by \(2^{cur_ss}\). Here, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the string `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. The value of `s` remains unchanged (it's still a non-empty string without its first character), `cur` is updated by adding \(2^{cur_ss}\) to its original value, and `cnt` remains unchanged unless `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), which is not specified to have changed here.
