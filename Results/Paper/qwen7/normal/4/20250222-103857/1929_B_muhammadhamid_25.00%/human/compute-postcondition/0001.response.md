Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space**.

This means that the code reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `n` and `k` are determined by the user's input.
