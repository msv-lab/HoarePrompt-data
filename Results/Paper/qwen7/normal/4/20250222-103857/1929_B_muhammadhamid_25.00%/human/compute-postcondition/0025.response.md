Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
   - The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by `int(input())`.
   - After the previous iteration, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will run one more time if there are still iterations left.
   - Therefore, the number of iterations left should be reduced by 1.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - The number of iterations left is reduced by 1, so it becomes `int(input()) - 3`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 3`**.
