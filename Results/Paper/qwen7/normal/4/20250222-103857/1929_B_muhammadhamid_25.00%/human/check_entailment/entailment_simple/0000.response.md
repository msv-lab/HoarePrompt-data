Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells to color in an \(n \times n\) grid such that at least \(k\) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. The solution provided handles three main cases:
   - When \(k = 1\), it prints 1 because coloring any single cell will satisfy the condition.
   - When \(k \leq 2n\), it calculates the minimum number of cells needed using \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).
   - When \(k > 2n\), it prints \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\). This is derived from the observation that once we cover all \(2n\) diagonals, each additional diagonal can be covered by adding one more cell, except when \(k\) is odd, where an extra cell is needed to ensure coverage.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the solution seems to correctly handle all specified conditions and edge cases. The provided examples also match the expected outputs.

Correctness: **True**
