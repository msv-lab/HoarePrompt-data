You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1. If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). After processing all test cases, the function ends with no return value, but the final values of \( n \) and \( k \) correspond to the last input pair provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If \( k = 1 \), the program prints `1`. This is correct because coloring any single cell will ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.

3. **General Case:**
   - If \( k \leq 2n \):
     - The program calculates `math.ceil(k / 2)` and prints it.
   - If \( k > 2n \):
     - The program calculates `k // 2 + 1` and prints it.

### Reasoning
- **Edge Case \( k = 1 \):**
  - Coloring any single cell ensures that at least one diagonal has a colored cell. This is correct.

- **General Case \( k \leq 2n \):**
  - Each cell in the grid can belong to up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, coloring \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells can cover at least \( k \) diagonals. This logic seems correct.

- **General Case \( k > 2n \):**
  - When \( k > 2n \), the program suggests coloring \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) cells. However, this approach might not always be optimal. For example, consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
    - There are \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals.
    - Coloring 4 cells (as suggested by \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 5 \)) might not be sufficient to cover all 10 diagonals optimally.
    - Instead, we need to ensure that every diagonal is covered. One optimal solution is to color the cells along the main diagonal and one additional cell from another diagonal, which would require at least 4 cells.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the general case \( k > 2n \) correctly. It suggests a formula that may not always yield the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals.

### Correctness
Given the analysis, the program is **incorrect** because it does not always provide the minimum number of cells required to cover \( k \) diagonals when \( k > 2n \).

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
