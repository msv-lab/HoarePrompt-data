Reasoning:
The given program correctly handles the different cases based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( 2n \):

1. **Case \( k = 1 \)**: The program correctly prints 1, as only one cell is needed to satisfy the condition.
2. **Case \( k \leq 2n \)**: The program uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to calculate the minimum number of cells needed. This is correct because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
3. **Case \( k > 2n \)**: The program prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). This is also correct because once \( k \) exceeds \( 2n \), each additional cell beyond \( 2n \) can still only contribute to 2 diagonals, but we need to account for the initial \( 2n \) cells which cover \( 2n \) diagonals, hence the formula \( \frac{k - 2n}{2} + 2n \div 2 + 1 \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to be correct for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
