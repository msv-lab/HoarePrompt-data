Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
- `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `1`. Since no other variables or values are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.
