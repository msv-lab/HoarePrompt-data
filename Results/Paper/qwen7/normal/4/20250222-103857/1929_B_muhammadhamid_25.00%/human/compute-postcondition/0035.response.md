Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, and the final values of `n` and `k` will be those provided by the last input pair. The number of iterations left would be 0, as the loop has completed all its executions.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `n` and `k` will be the same as the last input pair provided by the user. The loop counter will have reached zero, indicating that no more iterations are left to execute.
