Output State: **`j` is 5, `n` is an input integer**

The code replaces the current value of `n` with an integer input from the user. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 5. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 is preserved, as the code does not check this condition, only updates the value of `n`.
