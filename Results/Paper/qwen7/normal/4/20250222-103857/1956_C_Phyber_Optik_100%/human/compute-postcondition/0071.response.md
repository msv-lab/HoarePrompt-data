Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operations and returns the results accordingly.**

Note: The specific operations to be performed on `t` and `n` are not detailed in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the constraints and the nature of the input rather than the exact operations.
