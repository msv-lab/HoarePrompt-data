Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this variable is not involved in the loop, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is 14 (this variable is not involved in the loop, so it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 3.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the loop will continue as long as `3 < n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because the loop condition does not change `n`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `sum` remains 14.
   - `i` becomes 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 14, `i` is 4**
