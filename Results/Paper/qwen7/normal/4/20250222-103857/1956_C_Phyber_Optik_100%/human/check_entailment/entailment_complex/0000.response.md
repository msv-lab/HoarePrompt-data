Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The program calculates the sum using the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This formula does not correspond to the objective of maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through the allowed operations. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix by performing at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation involves setting either a row or a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\).

2. **Incorrect Operations**: The program prints two operations for each row from 1 to \(n\), but these operations do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, it prints:
   - A Type 1 operation setting the entire \(n\)-th column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - A Type 2 operation setting the entire \(n\)-th row to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\).

   However, the problem requires setting rows or columns to permutations to maximize the sum, not just setting the \(n\)-th row and column.

3. **Objective Mismatch**: The objective is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix, which means filling the matrix with the highest possible values. The provided solution does not achieve this. Instead, it seems to be calculating some kind of mathematical sum unrelated to the matrix operations.

Given these points, the provided program does not meet the problem requirements and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
