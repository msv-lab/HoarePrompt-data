Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is directly printed as 1.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 2, this expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The print statement will output the numbers in the following order: 1, `n - 1`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Given `n` is at least 4, let's consider `n = 4` for clarity:
     - `n - 1` would be `4 - 1 = 3`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` would generate `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Therefore, the output would be: `1 3 1 2 3 4`.

6. **General Case**:
   - For any `n >= 4`, the output will be `1`, followed by `n - 1`, and then all integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 n-1 1 2 ... n-1 n**
