Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n` within the `range(2, n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `sum` is 24 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
