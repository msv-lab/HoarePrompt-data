Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 5
   - `sum` is 32
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is the same as before (from the previous iteration)

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4 (since the loop starts from 2 and increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - `n` remains the same as it was before the previous iteration.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `j` and `sum` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 5, `sum` is 32, `i` is 4, `n` is the same as before**
