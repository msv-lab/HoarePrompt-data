Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`, prints the sum along with `n + n`, and then prints two lines for each `n` from 1 to `n`, each containing a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
