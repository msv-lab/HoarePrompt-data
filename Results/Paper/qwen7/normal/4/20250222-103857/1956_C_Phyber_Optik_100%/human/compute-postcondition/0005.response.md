Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is 5, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the current value of `sum`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 = (4 - 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6 - 1 = 5`. So, `sum` is updated to 5. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
