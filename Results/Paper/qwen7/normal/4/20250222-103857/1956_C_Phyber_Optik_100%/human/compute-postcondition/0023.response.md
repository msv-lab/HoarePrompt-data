Output State: `j` is 4, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `j` starting at 1 up to `n`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it means `j` has reached 3. Since the loop continues until `j` equals `n`, the next and final iteration will set `j` to 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter and is not modified within the loop.
