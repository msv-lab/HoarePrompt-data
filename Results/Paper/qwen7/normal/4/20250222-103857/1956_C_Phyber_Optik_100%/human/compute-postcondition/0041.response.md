Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is defined as `j_prev + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `j = j_prev + 1`: This means `j` is one more than `j_prev`.
   - `n > j_prev + 1`: This means `n` is greater than `j_prev + 1`.

4. **Calculating the Values:**
   - `2` is a constant and will always be printed as `2`.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j = j_prev + 1`, this expression simplifies to `n - (j_prev + 1) + 1 = n - j_prev`.
     - So, `n - j + 1` is equivalent to `n - j_prev`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This will print all numbers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

5. **Putting It All Together:**
   - The first part of the print statement will print `2`.
   - The second part will print `n - j_prev`.
   - The third part will print all numbers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

6. **Final Output:**
   - Combining all parts, the output will be `2` followed by `n - j_prev` followed by all numbers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 n - j_prev 1 2 ... n**
