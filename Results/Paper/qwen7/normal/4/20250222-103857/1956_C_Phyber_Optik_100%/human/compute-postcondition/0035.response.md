Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 5.
- `sum` is 120.
- `i` is 5.
- `n` is the same as before (which means `n` is also 5).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `sum`:**
   - From the initial state, `sum` is explicitly given as 120.

2. **Value of `n + n`:**
   - `n` is given as 5.
   - Therefore, `n + n` is `5 + 5`, which equals 10.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the values of `sum` and `n + n`.
- So, it will print `120` followed by `10`.

### Output:
Output: **120 10**
