Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is defined such that it must be greater than 4, but no specific value is provided. For the purpose of determining the output, we need to consider the general form of the expression involving `n`.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The first part of the `print` statement is `2`, which is directly printed as is.
   - The second part is `n - j + 1`. Given `j = 2`, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - The third part is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which expands to print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 (the smallest integer greater than 4).
   - If `n = 5`, then `n - 1 = 4`.
   - Therefore, the output will include `2`, `4`, and the range from `1` to `5`.

Final Output:
Output: **2 4 1 2 3 4 5**
