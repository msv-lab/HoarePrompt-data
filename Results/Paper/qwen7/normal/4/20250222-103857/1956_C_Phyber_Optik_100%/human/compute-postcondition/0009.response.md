Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 18, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Given that `i` is initially 4, the calculation becomes `(4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4 = (16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28 / 2 = 14`. Therefore, `sum` is updated to `14 + 14 = 18`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
