Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `2`: This is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, this expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments. The range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive) will generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the values `2`, `n`, and then all the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, the output will be:
Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n-1 n** (where `n` is the value of the input integer `n` and it is greater than or equal to 4)
