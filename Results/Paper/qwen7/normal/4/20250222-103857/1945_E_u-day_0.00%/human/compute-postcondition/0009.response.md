Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the range of `arr`.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same (since it is not modified within the loop body).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions for `arr`, `k`, and `pos` remain the same because they are not modified by the loop itself.

Given this reasoning, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `arr`, `k` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To express this precisely:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer**.
