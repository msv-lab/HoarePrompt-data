Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers (though this variable is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `k` is an integer (though this variable is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged).
   - `pos` is equal to the new value of `i`.

3. **Determine the new values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was `i_val` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_val + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must remain the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration because the loop condition is based on `range(n)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i_val + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` will be equal to the new value of `i`, so `pos` will be `i_val + 1`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is equal to `i_val + 1`**.
