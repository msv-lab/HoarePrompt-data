Output State: **`low`, `high`, and `mid` are integers, `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid` and `mid` is added to the set.**

The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` was already in the set, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`low`, `high`, and `mid`) retain their previous values.
