### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
- After performing the swaps, we need to use a binary search to find `x` such that `p_l` (the element at the left pointer) is equal to `x`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads a line of input and splits it into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - Returns a map object containing the integers.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list using `list(map_object)`.
   - Returns the list.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()`.
   - Reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.
   - Finds the index `pos` of `k` in `arr` (or sets `pos` to -1 if `k` is not found).
   - Performs a binary search-like operation to find a suitable midpoint `mid` where `arr[mid]` is close to `k`.
   - Prints `0` if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, otherwise prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3()` is flawed. It does not ensure that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the algorithm completes.
   - The binary search is used to find a midpoint `mid` where `arr[mid]` is close to `k`, but it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The provided code does not explicitly perform the required swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - The binary search-like operation does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     1
     3 2
     1 3 2
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     1
     1 3
     ```
   - However, the provided code outputs:
     ```
     0
     ```
   - This indicates that the code does not perform the necessary swaps to make `p_l` equal to `x`.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the required binary search and does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the algorithm completes.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
