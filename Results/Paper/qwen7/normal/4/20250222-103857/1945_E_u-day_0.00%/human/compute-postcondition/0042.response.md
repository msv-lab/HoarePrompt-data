Output State: **`low` is now `mid`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid` and `mid` is added to the set.**

Explanation: The variable `low` is reassigned to the current value of `mid`. The value of `high` remains unchanged. The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. The set `st` contains the value of `mid` and `mid` is added to the set again, which means `st` now contains the same value twice.
