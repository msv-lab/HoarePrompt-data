Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search algorithm in the program does not ensure that the element `p_l` is equal to `x` after the algorithm completes. Instead, the program attempts to find the position of `x` in the array using a modified binary search approach, but it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the algorithm ends.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array. If `x` is not in the array, the program will not perform any swaps and will incorrectly conclude that `x` is not present. This violates the requirement that the program should rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 2
  1 3 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  1 3
  ```

However, the provided program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not perform any swaps and incorrectly concludes that `x` is not present in the array. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
