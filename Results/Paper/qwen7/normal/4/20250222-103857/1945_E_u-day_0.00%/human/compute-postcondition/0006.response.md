Output State: **`pos` is equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `arr`, `k` is an integer, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `pos`, so `pos` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
