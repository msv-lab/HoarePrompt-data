Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged, `st` is a set containing the value `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states. The set `st` now contains the single element `mid`.
