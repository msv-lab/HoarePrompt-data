Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `pos` is equal to the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which means `pos` now holds the value of `i` after it was incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
