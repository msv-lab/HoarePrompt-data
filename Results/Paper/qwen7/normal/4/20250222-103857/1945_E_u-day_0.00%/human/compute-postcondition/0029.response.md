Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `k`, `pos`, and `st` remain as they are after the if-else block executes. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `n - 1`. The value of `mid` is recalculated accordingly, and `st` still contains the value `mid`.
