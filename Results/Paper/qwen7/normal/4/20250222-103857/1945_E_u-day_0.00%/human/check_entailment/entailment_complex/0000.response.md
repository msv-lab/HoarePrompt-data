Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: The code correctly defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`). However, `func_2` is incorrectly defined as it calls `func_1` but does not pass any arguments, which is not consistent with the expected behavior. Instead, it should directly handle the input for each test case.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The implementation of the binary search in `func_3` is flawed. The purpose of the binary search here is to rearrange the permutation so that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search. The current implementation does not achieve this goal. Specifically, the binary search logic is used to find the position of `k` in a sorted version of `arr`, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

3. **Rearrangement Logic**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most two swaps to ensure that the binary search on the rearranged permutation finds `x` at the start (`p_l`). The current implementation does not provide the necessary logic to achieve this.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the logic inside `func_3` does not produce the correct rearrangements.

Given these observations, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
