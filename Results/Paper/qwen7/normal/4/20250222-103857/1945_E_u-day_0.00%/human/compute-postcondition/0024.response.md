Postcondition: `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged, `st` is a set containing the value `mid`, and the current value of `mid` satisfies `arr[mid] > k`.
