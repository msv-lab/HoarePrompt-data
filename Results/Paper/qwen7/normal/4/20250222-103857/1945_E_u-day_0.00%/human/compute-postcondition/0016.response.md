Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have the final value of `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be set to the index where `k` is located. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will still be `-1`.
