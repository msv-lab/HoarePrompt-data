Output State: The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`. The set `st` will contain all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop. 

The exact values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `arr` and `k`, but they will be such that `low + 1` is not less than `high`. The set `st` will include all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.
