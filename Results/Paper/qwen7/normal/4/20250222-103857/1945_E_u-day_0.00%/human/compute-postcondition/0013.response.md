Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `k` is an integer, `pos` is `i`.**

Explanation: The line `pos = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `pos`. Since `i` was previously defined as `i_val + 1`, `pos` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
