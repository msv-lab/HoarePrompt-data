Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `le`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
