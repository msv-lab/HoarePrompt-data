Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is equal to `r - 1` (since `l` keeps increasing by 1 each iteration until it is no longer less than `r`), `r` is the original value of `n - 1`, `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]` (because the loop stops when `l` is no longer less than `r` or when `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`), `st` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, which is `l + 1`, `end` is 1.

This means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `l` will be one less than `r`, indicating that the last pair of elements `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` were not equal, causing the loop to terminate. The variable `st` will hold the total number of iterations the loop performed.
