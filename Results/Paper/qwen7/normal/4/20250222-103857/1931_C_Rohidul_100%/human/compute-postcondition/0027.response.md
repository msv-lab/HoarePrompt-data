Output State: `r` is one less than `l`, meaning `r = l - 1`; `end` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop performed, which is `l`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `r` will be one less than `l` because the loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`. Once these conditions are no longer met, the loop terminates. The variable `end` will hold the total number of iterations, which is `l + 1` since `end` is incremented each time the loop runs.
