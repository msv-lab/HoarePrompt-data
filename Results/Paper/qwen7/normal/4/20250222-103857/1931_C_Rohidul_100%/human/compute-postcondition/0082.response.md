Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**: We need to ensure that both parts of the loop condition are satisfied for the loop to execute one more time.

From the given information:
- `l` is increased by 1 (`l` is increased by 1, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`).
- `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `l < r` (this part is dependent on the values of `l` and `r`, but we cannot change `r` as per the instructions).
- `a[l] == a[l + 1]` (this part is dependent on the values in the list `a`, and we can adjust `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]`).

Since `l` is increased by 1, for the loop to continue, `a[l]` must still be equal to `a[l + 1]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]` after `l` is incremented.

So, the state adjustments required are:
- `l` is increased by 1.
- Ensure `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the final state should reflect these adjustments.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` must be increased by 1 and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is 3**
