Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program does not account for the optimal way to perform the operations to minimize the cost. Specifically, the program only checks the first and last elements and does not consider other possible segments of the array that might lead to a lower cost.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program would incorrectly output `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`. We can achieve this by setting the segment from index 1 to 3 to the value 1, which costs `(3 - 1 + 1) = 3` burles, and then setting the remaining element to 1, which costs `1` burle, totaling `4` burles. However, a better approach is to set the segment from index 1 to 4 to the value 1, which costs `(4 - 1 + 1) = 4` burles, but we can do it in two operations: first set the segment from index 1 to 3 to 1 (costing 3 burles), and then set the last element to 1 (costing 1 burle), totaling `4` burles, but we can do it in one operation by setting the entire array to 1, costing `5` burles, which is not optimal.

A correct solution would involve identifying the longest subarray with the same elements and calculating the cost based on that.
