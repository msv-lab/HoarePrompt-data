Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is increased by 1, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is 3**.

Explanation: The variable `st` was initially set to 2. After executing `st += 1`, the value of `st` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
