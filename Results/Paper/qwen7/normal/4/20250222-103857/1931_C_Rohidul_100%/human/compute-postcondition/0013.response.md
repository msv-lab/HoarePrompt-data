Output State: **`l` is increased by 1**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `l` exists (though its specific value is not given), the only change is that `l` is now one more than whatever its original value was. Therefore, `l` is increased by 1.
