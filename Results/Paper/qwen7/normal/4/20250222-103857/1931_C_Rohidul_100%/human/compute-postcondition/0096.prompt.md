Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `l` reaches `r-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and increase `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. Since the loop executes until `l` is no longer less than `r`, it means that `l` will eventually be equal to `r-1` when the condition `l < r` fails. At this point, all consecutive duplicates in the list have been removed, and `st` will be equal to the original value of `n` because each iteration increments `st` by 1.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `l` reaches `r-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is now `r-1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-2`, `st` is `n`, `r` is decreased by 1 and is now `l+1`, and `end` is increased by 1 to `end+1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-2`, `st` is `n`, `r` is now `l+1-1` which is `l`, `end` is increased by 1 to `end+1`, and `a[l+1]` must be equal to `a[l]`; `end` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
