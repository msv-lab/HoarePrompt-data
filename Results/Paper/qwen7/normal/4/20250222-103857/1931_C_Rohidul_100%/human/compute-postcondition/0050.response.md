Output State: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the original value of `n - 1`, `end` is 2, `ans` is max(0, le - (st + end)), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last value `st` took before the loop condition became false, `end` is 2.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be equal to `r`, meaning the left pointer has caught up with the right pointer. The value of `r` remains as it was initially (`n - 1`). The other variables (`end`, `ans`, `a`, `le`, `st`, and `end`) retain their states from the last iteration where the loop condition `l < r` was still true. Specifically, `st` will hold the value it had just before the loop's termination condition was met.
