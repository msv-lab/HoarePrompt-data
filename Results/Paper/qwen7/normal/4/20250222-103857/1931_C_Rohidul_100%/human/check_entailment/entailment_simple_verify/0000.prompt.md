You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program does not account for the optimal way to perform the operations to minimize the cost. Specifically, the program only checks the first and last elements and does not consider other possible segments of the array that might lead to a lower cost.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program would incorrectly output `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`. We can achieve this by setting the segment from index 1 to 3 to the value 1, which costs `(3 - 1 + 1) = 3` burles, and then setting the remaining element to 1, which costs `1` burle, totaling `4` burles. However, a better approach is to set the segment from index 1 to 4 to the value 1, which costs `(4 - 1 + 1) = 4` burles, but we can do it in two operations: first set the segment from index 1 to 3 to 1 (costing 3 burles), and then set the last element to 1 (costing 1 burle), totaling `4` burles, but we can do it in one operation by setting the entire array to 1, costing `5` burles, which is not optimal.

A correct solution would involve identifying the longest subarray with the same elements and calculating the cost based on that.
