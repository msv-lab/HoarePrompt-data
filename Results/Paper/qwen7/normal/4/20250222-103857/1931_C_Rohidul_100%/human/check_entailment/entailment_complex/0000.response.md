Reasoning:
1. The provided solution iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the given operation.
2. For each test case, it identifies the longest segment of consecutive identical elements at the start (`st`) and end (`end`) of the array.
3. The idea is to minimize the cost by changing the entire segment between these two segments to match either the start or end segment's value, whichever is longer.
4. The logic correctly handles the edge case where the first and last elements are the same by adjusting the calculation to avoid double-counting the segment.
5. The overall approach is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
