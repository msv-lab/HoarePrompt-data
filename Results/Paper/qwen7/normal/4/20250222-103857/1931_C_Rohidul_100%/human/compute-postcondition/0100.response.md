Postcondition: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is equal to `l+1`, `end` is `le-1`, `ans` is `le - max(n, le-1)`. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
