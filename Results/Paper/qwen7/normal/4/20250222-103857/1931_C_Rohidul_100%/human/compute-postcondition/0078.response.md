Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is increased by 1, `st` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1, making its value `2`. The other variables (`le`, `n`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
