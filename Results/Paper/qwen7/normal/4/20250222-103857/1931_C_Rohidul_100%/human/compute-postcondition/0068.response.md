Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, the current value of `r` is `n - k - 1`, `end` is `2k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, and `ans` is updated to max(0, le - ((n - k - 1) + (2k + 1))) if the first and last elements of list `a` are equal. If the first and last elements are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged.
