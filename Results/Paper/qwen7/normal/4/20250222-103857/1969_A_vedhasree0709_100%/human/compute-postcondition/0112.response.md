Output State: `i` is `n`, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1] - (n-2)`, `j` is either 1 or 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it is no longer less than or equal to `n-1`. The variables `p` and `q` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, which are `l[n-1]` and `l[l[n-1] - 1] - (n-2)` respectively, assuming the loop did not break early. The value of `j` remains either 1 or 0 depending on whether the condition `q == i + 1` was met during any iteration of the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
