Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `p` is `l[0]`.
- `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`.
- `j` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The current value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(2)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is 0.
2. Since `q` is equal to `i + 1`, `q` is `0 + 1`, so `q` is 1.
3. The value of `q` is also described as `l[l[0] - 1]`. Given that `q` is 1, this means `l[0] - 1` must be the index that gives us the value 1. Therefore, `l[0]` must be 2 because `l[0] - 1 = 1`.
4. With `l[0]` being 2, `p` is `l[0]`, so `p` is 2.
5. The `print(2)` statement simply prints the number 2.

Output: **2**
