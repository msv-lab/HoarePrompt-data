### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func()` iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It then uses a while loop to check pairs of friends `(i, l[i-1])` to see if they form a cycle where both friends can be invited with just 2 invitations.
   - If such a pair is found (`q == i + 1`), it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The code correctly identifies when a pair of friends can be invited with just 2 invitations if they form a cycle where both friends can be included.
   - However, the code does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where multiple cycles exist or where the structure is more complex than a simple cycle.
   - The logic only checks for the simplest case of a direct cycle of length 2. It does not account for cases where the structure might be more complex, such as multiple disjoint cycles or chains.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
     - The code would find the pair (4, 5) and print `2`, which is correct.
   - **Example 2**: `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
     - The code would incorrectly print `2` because it only checks for direct cycles.
     - The correct answer should be `3` because we need to invite friends 1, 2, and 3 to ensure at least 2 friends come.
   - **Example 3**: `p = [2, 1]`
     - The code would correctly print `2` because both friends can be invited with just 2 invitations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. It fails to handle more complex structures and only checks for the simplest case of a direct cycle of length 2.

**Correctness: False**
