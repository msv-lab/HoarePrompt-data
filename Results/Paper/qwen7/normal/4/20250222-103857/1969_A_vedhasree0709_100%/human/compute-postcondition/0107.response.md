Output State: **`i` is 2, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1] - 1`, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

The code `j = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. Since the initial state of `j` was either 1 or 0, and now it is explicitly set to 1, we update the state accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
