Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `j` to 1. Since `j` was already 1 initially, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values as per the initial state.
