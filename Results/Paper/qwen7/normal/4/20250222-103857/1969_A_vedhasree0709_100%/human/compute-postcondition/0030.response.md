Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]`, and if `q` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
