Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`, and if `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
