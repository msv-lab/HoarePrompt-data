Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from `range(x)`, and `x` is an input integer which can be at most 100, so the maximum value of `i` would be 99), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged within its initial bounds, `i` will be set to 99 (the maximum possible value since the loop runs `x` times and `x` can be at most 100), and `x` and `y` will retain their last input values from the loop's final iteration.
