Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - The condition `x > y` is true if and only if `x` is greater than `y`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(x)` will execute as long as `i < x`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `x` remains the same as the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, and the condition `x > y` is true if and only if `x` is greater than `y`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y`.**
