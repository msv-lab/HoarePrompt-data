### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading pairs of integers (`x` and `y`).

2. **Comparison and Output**: For each pair of integers (`x` and `y`), the program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values and prints them in the required format.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the number of test cases. This ensures that all test cases are processed.

4. **Output Format**: The output is formatted correctly, with the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `x` equals `y` (e.g., `3 3`), printing the same value twice.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic and implementation appear to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
