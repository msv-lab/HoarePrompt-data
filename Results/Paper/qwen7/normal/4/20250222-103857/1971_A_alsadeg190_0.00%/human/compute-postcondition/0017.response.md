Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is converted to an integer from the first input.
- `y` is converted to an integer from the second input.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are the input integers)**
