Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x`.

Since `y` and `x` are explicitly described as input integers, they will be directly printed without any further calculation or transformation.

Output: **y, x**
