Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is converted to an integer from the first input, `y` is converted to an integer from the second input. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
