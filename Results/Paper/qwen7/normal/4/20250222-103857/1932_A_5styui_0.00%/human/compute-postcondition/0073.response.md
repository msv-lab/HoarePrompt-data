Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `b`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range of `len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' (if `s` is 1) or `j` is 0 (if `s` is 0).

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - If `s` is 1, then `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@'.
   - If `s` is 0, then `j` is 0.

Given these points, let's consider both scenarios:

- **If `s` is 1**:
  - `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@'.
  - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next character in the string `b`.

- **If `s` is 0**:
  - `j` is 0.
  - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be set to 1 to check the first character in the string `b`.

Since the loop continues based on the value of `j`, we need to adjust `j` accordingly.

### Conclusion:
- If `s` is 1, `j` should be incremented by 1.
- If `s` is 0, `j` should be set to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' and `j` is incremented by 1, `d` is an input integer**.

However, since we need to generalize it for both cases, the most accurate representation would be:

**State: **`s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer**.

To simplify and ensure clarity:

**State: **`s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer**.
