Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is 1
- `b` is a non-empty string
- `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0
- `d` is an input integer
- If `b[j]` equals '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `s`:**
   - The value of `s` does not change within the loop as it is not modified inside the loop. Therefore, `s` remains 1.
   
2. **Variable `b`:**
   - The length of `b` does not change within the loop. Therefore, `b` remains a non-empty string.
   
3. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j` being an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0. Since `s` is 1, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@'.
   - After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 (`j += 1`).
   - The loop will continue until `j` reaches the length of `b` or `b[j]` equals '*'. If `b[j]` equals '*', the loop will break.
   
4. **Variable `d`:**
   - The value of `d` does not change within the loop as it is not modified inside the loop. Therefore, `d` remains the input integer.

### Adjusting the State:
- `s` remains 1.
- `b` remains a non-empty string.
- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is an index where `b[j]` equals '@').
- `d` remains the input integer.

### New State:
- `s` is 1
- `b` is a non-empty string
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value, which is an index where `b[j]` equals '@'
- `d` is the input integer

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value (an index where `b[j]` equals '@'), `d` is the input integer**
