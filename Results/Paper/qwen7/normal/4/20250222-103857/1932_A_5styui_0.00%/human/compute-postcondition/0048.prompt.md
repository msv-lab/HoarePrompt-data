Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string from the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index 0 of `b` is '@', then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, if the character at index 1 of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the character at index 0 of `b` remains not '*', and no change is made to `j` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1 and `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', `s` is an integer which is 1 more than the original value of `s`. If the character at index `j` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j` is neither '@' nor '*', the same conditions hold without any change.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2 and `b` is a non-empty string. If `b[2]` equals '@', then `s` is 3 (1 more than its initial value). If `b[2]` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` is neither '@' nor '*', the function also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
