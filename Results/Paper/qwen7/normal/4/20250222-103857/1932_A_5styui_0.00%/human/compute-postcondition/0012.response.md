Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', and the slice `b[:]` is truthy and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j` and `b`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no loop or conditional statement was specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context. The conditions about `j`, `b`, and the character at index `j` of `b` remain unchanged.
