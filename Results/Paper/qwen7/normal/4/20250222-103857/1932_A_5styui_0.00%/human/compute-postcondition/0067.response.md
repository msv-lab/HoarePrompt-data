Postcondition: `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 0, and if the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or if the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, no change is made to the variables.
