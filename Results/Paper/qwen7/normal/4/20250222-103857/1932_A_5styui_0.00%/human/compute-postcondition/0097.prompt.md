Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `b` is an input string, `j` is 1, and `d` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@', `d` is an input integer, if the character at index `j` of `b` is '@'. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 0, and if the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or if the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither character is '*', no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is an index within the string `b` where `b[j]` equals '@' or `j` is 1 if `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer, and if `b[j]` equals '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value (an index where `b[j]` equals '@'), `d` is the input integer, and if `b[j + 1]` equals '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j + 1]` does not equal '*', the function continues without any additional changes to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
