Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, a is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input for `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and the input for `a` is an integer between 1 and 50, these conditions are maintained. The initial condition for `n` and the string of characters is not affected by this code snippet, but the value of `a` is updated to the input integer.
