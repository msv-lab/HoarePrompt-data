Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, and `suff[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`. Each iteration updates `suff[i]` based on the value of `suff[i+1]` and the current element `c[i]` in the list `c`. Since the loop starts at `n-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`, after all iterations, `i` will be `-1`. At this point, `suff[-1]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c`, as each `suff[i]` is built up from `suff[i+1]` plus `c[i]` in reverse order.
