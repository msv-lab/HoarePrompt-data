Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, and `suff[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.

To understand this, let's break down the process:

1. The loop starts with `i` set to `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes `-1`.
2. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. This means that `suff[i]` accumulates the sum of all `c[j]` from `j = i` to `n-1`.

By the time `i` reaches `-1`, `suff[-1]` will hold the sum of all elements in `c` because it will have accumulated the sum starting from `c[n-1]` and moving backwards to `c[0]`.

Thus, the final value of `suff[-1]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
