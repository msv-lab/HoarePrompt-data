Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`. It also reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the values `a_i` and `b_i` respectively.

2. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - It calculates the cost array `c` where `c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])`.
   - It computes the suffix sum array `suff` which helps in efficiently calculating the total cost of moving Kirill to positions before `i`.

3. **Optimal Position Calculation**:
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `k-1`, it calculates the cost of moving Kirill to position `i` by adding `a[i]` (the direct cost to move to position `i`) and the total cost of moving everyone between `i+1` and `n` (stored in `suff[i+1]`).

4. **Result Output**:
   - The minimum cost among these calculated costs is stored in `ans` and printed.

The logic implemented in the program accurately reflects the problem statement and constraints, ensuring that the solution is both efficient and correct.
