Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters and Initialization**: The function `func_1` correctly takes `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as parameters. It initializes a list `c` which stores the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The list `suff` is calculated to store the cumulative sum of the values in `c` from right to left. This ensures that `suff[i]` represents the sum of the minimum values from index `i` to the end of the list.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost. It iterates through the first `k` elements of `a` and calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. The minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function prints the minimum cost `ans`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the requirements. The function correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
