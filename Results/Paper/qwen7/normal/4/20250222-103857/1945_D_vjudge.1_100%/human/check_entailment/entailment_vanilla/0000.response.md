Let's break down the solution step by step to ensure it correctly addresses the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - A new array `c` is created where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
     - A suffix sum array `suff` is initialized.
     - The suffix sum array `suff` is populated by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning, accumulating the values from `c`.
     - The variable `ans` is set to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
     - The loop iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost of moving Kirill to each of these positions, updating `ans` with the minimum value found.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each position `i` in the first `k` positions, the cost is calculated as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
   - `a[i]` represents the cost to move Kirill to position `i` directly.
   - `suff[i + 1]` represents the accumulated cost of moving through all positions from `i + 1` to the end of the line.

4. **Output**:
   - The minimum cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- The logic for calculating the minimum cost seems correct. The use of suffix sums ensures that the cumulative cost of moving through subsequent positions is efficiently computed.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
