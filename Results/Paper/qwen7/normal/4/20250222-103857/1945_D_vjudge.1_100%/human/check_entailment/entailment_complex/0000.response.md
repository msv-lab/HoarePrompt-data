Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values and passes them to the function `func_1`.
2. In `func_1`, the program constructs a list `c` which contains the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i`.
3. The program then calculates the suffix sum array `suff` which stores the cumulative sum of the elements in `c` from the end of the list to the beginning.
4. The program initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the first `k` elements of the list `a`, updating `ans` with the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
5. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program aims to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue by considering both the cost of bribing the person directly in front of him (`a[i]`) and the cost of bribing all people between him and the target position (`b[i]`).

The steps taken in the program match the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
