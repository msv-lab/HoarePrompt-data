Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree.**

Explanation: The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This means the queue now contains the starting node along with a distance of 0 from the start node. The values of `start` and `target` remain unchanged.
