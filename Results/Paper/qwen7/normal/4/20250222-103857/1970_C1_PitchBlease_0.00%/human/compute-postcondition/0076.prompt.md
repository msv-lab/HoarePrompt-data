Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `current` node will be the node that is closest to the `target` node among all nodes that have been visited, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, and `queue` is a list containing tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for all unvisited neighbors of the current node, where `neighbor` is a node adjacent to the current node and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `neighbor` node.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `current` will be the node closest to the `target` that has been fully explored (i.e., all its neighbors have been added to the queue or marked as visited), `visited` will include all nodes that have been visited during the search, and `queue` will contain tuples for all unvisited neighbors of the current node, ensuring that the shortest path to each node is considered.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: The algorithm has fully explored the tree starting from the `start` node. All nodes reachable from `start` have been visited, and the variable `dist` holds the shortest distance from `start` to each node. The `visited` set contains every node that has been processed, and the `queue` is empty since no new nodes need to be processed. The `current` node will be the last node processed, and `dist` will represent the distance from `start` to this node.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: The `current` variable is the first element of the `queue`, `dist` is the second element of the `queue` incremented by the number of times the loop has executed, `queue` is the list of remaining elements in the `queue` after removing the first element, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, with each node's distance from the start recorded in the `queue`. The `tree` structure remains unchanged, and the loop continues to process neighbors of the current node until the `queue` is empty or the `target` node is found and returned.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `current` will be the first node in the final `queue`, `dist` will be the distance from the start node to `current` plus the number of iterations the loop ran, `queue` will contain all unvisited nodes and their distances from the start node, `visited` will include all nodes that were processed, and the `tree` structure will remain as it was initially.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
