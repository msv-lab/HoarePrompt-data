Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, and either `neighbor` has been added to `visited` and `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, or `neighbor` is not in `visited` and remains unchanged.
