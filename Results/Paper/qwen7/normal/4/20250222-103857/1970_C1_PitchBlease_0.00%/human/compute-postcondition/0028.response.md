Output State: **`current` is the node that was at the front of the queue (queue.popleft()), `dist` is the distance from the start node to `current`, `queue` is the queue with the first element removed, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal.**

In this output state, the `current` node is updated to be the node that was at the front of the queue before it was removed. The `dist` variable is assigned the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. The `queue` is now the original queue with its first element removed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
