The loop head condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the `queue` is not empty. Given that the `queue` is empty at the end of the previous iteration, the loop cannot execute one more time because the condition `queue` is not empty is not met.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time since the loop condition is already not satisfied.

State: **No changes needed**
