You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. Both start and target are within the range 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where tree[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The `current` node will be the target node, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node, `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` and `target` nodes. The `tree` structure remains unchanged, and the loop terminates when the `target` node is found and its distance is returned.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the algorithm has successfully found the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `current` node will be the `target` node, `dist` will represent the shortest distance between them, `queue` will be empty because there are no more nodes to process, `visited` will include all nodes along the shortest path, and the `tree` structure remains the same as when the loop started.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found during the traversal. The current node is undefined, dist is undefined, queue is empty, visited contains all nodes that were checked, and the tree structure remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 if the target node is not found. If the target node is found, it returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the function returns the second element of the original queue, it means the distance has been updated and is returned. If the target node is not found after traversing the entire tree, the function returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the distance (`dist`) from the start node (`start`) to the current node (`current`) that was at the front of the queue before it was removed.

Case_3: The program returns the second element of the original queue, which is 'dist'

Case_4: The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found during the traversal. The current node is undefined, dist is undefined, queue is empty, visited contains all nodes that were checked, and the tree structure remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
