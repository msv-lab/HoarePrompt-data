Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`; `dist` is the second element of `queue`; `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is an element of `tree[current]`, and either `neighbor` is added to `visited` with `dist + 1` as its distance from the start, or `neighbor` is not in `visited` and `queue` now includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, and either `neighbor` has been added to `visited` and `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, or `neighbor` is not in `visited` and remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue` plus 1, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, and if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
