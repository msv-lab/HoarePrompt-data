Postcondition: **`current` is either `neighbor` or remains unchanged, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`, `queue` is a list containing tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended with `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`, and remains unchanged if `neighbor` is already in `visited`.**
