Postcondition: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and after executing the if statement, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**
