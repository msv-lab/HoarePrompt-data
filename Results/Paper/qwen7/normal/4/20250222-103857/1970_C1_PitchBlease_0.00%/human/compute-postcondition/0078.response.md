Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 if the target node is not found. If the target node is found, it returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the function returns the second element of the original queue, it means the distance has been updated and is returned. If the target node is not found after traversing the entire tree, the function returns -1.**
