Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program returns the distance (`dist`) from the start node (`start`) to the current node (`current`) if `current` is the target node. If `current` is not the target node, the program continues with the next node in the queue.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and after executing the if statement, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and after executing the if statement, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor` that was just processed, and `queue` now contains tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of `current`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
