Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` (the number of moves) is odd and `c` (the desired number of cubes) is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, the parity (odd or even nature) of `b` and `c` must match for it to be possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. 

For example, consider the test case `(5, 3)`:
- `b = 5` (odd)
- `c = 3` (odd)

Since both `b` and `c` are odd, it should be possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. However, the current implementation incorrectly prints "No" for this case because it checks `a % 2 == b % 2`, which is not the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

To fix this, the program should check if `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`.
