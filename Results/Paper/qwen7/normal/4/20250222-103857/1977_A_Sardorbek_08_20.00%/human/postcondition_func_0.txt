The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)), and prints 'YES' if \( n \) equals \( m \), 'NO' if \( n \) is less than \( m \), 'Yes' if both \( n \) and \( m \) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
