Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). The function does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q` regardless of the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`.**
