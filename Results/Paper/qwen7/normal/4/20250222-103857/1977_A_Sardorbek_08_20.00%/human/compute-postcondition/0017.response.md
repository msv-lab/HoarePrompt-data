Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `q`) are not relevant to this particular print statement, as it does not reference any of them.

Output: **No**
