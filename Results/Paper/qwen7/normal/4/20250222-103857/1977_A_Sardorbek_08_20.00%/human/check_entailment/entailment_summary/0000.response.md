Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube. The program should check if `n` equals `m`, if `n` is less than `m`, if both `n` and `m` have the same parity, and otherwise, print 'No'.

However, there are a few issues in the logic of the program:
1. The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it should be `elif b < c:` instead of `elif b < c:`.
2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not relevant to the problem. It should be checking if `n` and `m` have the same parity.
3. The condition `else:` should correctly handle all other cases, which means if none of the above conditions are met, the answer should be 'No'.

Given these points, let's correct the logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:  # Check if n and m have the same parity
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Based on the corrected logic, the original program is incorrect due to the misplacement and incorrect conditions.

Correctness: **False**
