You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers that were input for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration where `n > 1`, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The final output will be the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2` for each valid `n > 1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the output for that iteration is simply `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than half the single yogurt price `a`. In such cases, it is always cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at price `a` rather than using the promotion. However, the program does not account for this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 5 10
```
The expected output should be 20 (since buying two yogurts at 10 burles each is cheaper than buying four yogurts at 5 burles each). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as 15 (using the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).

To fix this, the program should include a condition to check if `b` is less than `a / 2` and adjust the calculation accordingly.
