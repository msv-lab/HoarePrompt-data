### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic in the program. Let's break down the analysis and verify each part:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints `a` (the price of one yogurt), which is correct because buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.

3. **Promotion Calculation:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The total cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - `ans2`: The total cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price (`b * n // 2`), and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price (`a * n % 2`).

4. **Minimum Cost Determination:**
   - The program correctly determines the minimum cost between `ans1` and `ans2` using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Verification with Example Inputs:

Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `min(10, 14) = 9`

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 18) = 15`

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 17`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 17) = 15`

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 5 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`

The program produces the correct outputs for all the example inputs.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program is correct.

**Final: True**
