Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `n > 1`, the function calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1 = a * n`: The cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: The cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.
4. It then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for buying `n` yogurts.
5. If `n <= 1`, it correctly prints the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price.
6. The logic for calculating the cost when `n > 1` is correct because it maximizes the use of the promotion while minimizing the total cost.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
