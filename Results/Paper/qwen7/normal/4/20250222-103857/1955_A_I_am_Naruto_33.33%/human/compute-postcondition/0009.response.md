Postcondition: `t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than 1, then `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, no additional variables are defined, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
