Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts under two scenarios:
   - Buying each yogurt individually at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price (`b * n // 2`) and any remaining individual yogurts at the regular price (`a * n % 2`).
4. It then prints the minimum cost between these two scenarios.
5. The logic handles the special case when `n` is 1 or less, which is correctly priced at `a`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
