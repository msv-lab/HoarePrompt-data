Output State: **`t` must be within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans1` is `a * n`**.

The code assigns the product of `a` and `n` to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
