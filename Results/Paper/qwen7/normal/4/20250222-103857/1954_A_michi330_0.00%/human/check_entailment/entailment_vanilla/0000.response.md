Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, it prints 'NO'.
     2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the difference between the total number of parts `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by the number of colors `m` is less than `k`. If true, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Condition `n <= k`:**
   - If `n <= k`, it means Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. Hence, printing 'NO' is correct.

2. **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:**
   - This condition needs to be analyzed more carefully.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / m`, which represents the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that even after Bob repainting up to `k` parts, not all parts can be the same color.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even after Bob repaints up to `k` parts, there will still be at least one part of a different color, preventing all parts from being the same color. Hence, printing 'YES' is correct.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is true, so it prints 'NO'.
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < 1` is true, so it prints 'NO'.
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 > 1`, so it prints 'YES'.
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 <= 2`, so it prints 'NO'.
- **Test Case 5:** `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 > 3`, so it prints 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
