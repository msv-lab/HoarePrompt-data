Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state described, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input split, but their specific values are not relevant to the print statement. The variable `itest` is assigned the value of `t`. The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.
