Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
- The condition `(n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k)` is true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given that the condition `(n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k)` is true, the `print('NO')` statement will execute regardless of the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output: **'NO'**
