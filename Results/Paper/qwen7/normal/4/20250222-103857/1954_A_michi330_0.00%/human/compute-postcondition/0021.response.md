Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; n, m, and k are integers assigned the values from the input split for each iteration; itest equals t after all iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned based on the input provided. The variable `itest` will equal `t` after all iterations because `itest` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs exactly `t` times.
