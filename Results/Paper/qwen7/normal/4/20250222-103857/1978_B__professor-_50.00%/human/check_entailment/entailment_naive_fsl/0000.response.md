Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where `b` is between `a` and `n`. According to the problem description, if `b` is greater than `a` but less than `n`, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5 8
```
Here, `n = 4`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`. The optimal strategy would be to sell the first `b - a = 8 - 5 = 3` buns at the modified prices (8, 7, 6) and the remaining bun at the usual price (5). The total profit should be `8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 26`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the profit as `int((2 * 8 - 4 + 1) * 4 / 2) = 26 / 2 = 13`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
