Output State: **t is 0, and the values of n, a, and b are undefined.**

Explanation: The loop continues to run until `t` reaches 0. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and `t` is now 0, it means there are no more test cases left to process. Therefore, `t` is 0, and since the loop has finished, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined because they were part of the input for each iteration and are not stored or modified outside the loop.
