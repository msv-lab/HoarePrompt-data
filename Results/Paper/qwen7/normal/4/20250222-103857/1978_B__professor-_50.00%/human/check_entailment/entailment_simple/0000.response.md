### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**: The program prints \( n \times a \), which is the correct profit since selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**: The program calculates the profit using the formula \( \frac{(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \). This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is \( b \) and the last term is \( b - (n-1) \).
   - **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**: The program calculates the profit using the formula \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \). This formula accounts for the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns sold at the modified prices and the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is correct.

5. **Final State**: The final state comment `t is 0, and the values of n, a, and b are undefined.` is not relevant because the program does not leave the loop until all test cases are processed.

Given the analysis, the program logic and conditions are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
