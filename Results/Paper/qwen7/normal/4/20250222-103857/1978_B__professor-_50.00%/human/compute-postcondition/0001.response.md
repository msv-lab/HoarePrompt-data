State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The only variable in the loop head is `t`.
- For the loop `for _ in range(t)` to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The initial state of `t` as an input integer representing the number of test cases does not guarantee that the loop will execute unless `t` is greater than 0.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
