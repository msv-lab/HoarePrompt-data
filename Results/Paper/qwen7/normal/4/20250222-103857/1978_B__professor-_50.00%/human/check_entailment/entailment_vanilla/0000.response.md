### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The program checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If true, it means there is no benefit in reducing the price, so it prints `n * a` which is the total profit if all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The next condition checks if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`. This implies that the reduction in price (`b - a`) is enough to cover all `n` buns with the modified pricing scheme. The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which represents the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1.
   - The final condition handles the general case where `b - a` is less than `n`. Here, the program uses the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` to calculate the profit. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence plus the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b` is less than or equal to `a` and when `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` correctly.
   - The general case formula is also correctly applied.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly and uses the appropriate formulas to compute the maximum profit.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: **True**
