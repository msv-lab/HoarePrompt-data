Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is set to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to integers from the input split by spaces.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   ```python
   int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Expression**:
   - `(b - a)`: This is the difference between `b` and `a`.
   - `(b - a) / 2`: This is half of the difference between `b` and `a`.
   - `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This is the product of half the difference between `b` and `a` and one more than the difference.
   - `a * n`: This is the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `int(...)`: The entire expression is cast to an integer.

4. **Substituting the Values**:
   - Let's assume the input integers `n`, `a`, and `b` are provided as `n_val`, `a_val`, and `b_val` respectively.
   - The expression becomes:
     ```python
     int(((b_val - a_val) / 2) * (b_val - a_val + 1) + a_val * n_val)
     ```

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Calculate `(b_val - a_val) / 2`.
   - Multiply the result by `(b_val - a_val + 1)`.
   - Add `a_val * n_val` to the result.
   - Convert the final result to an integer.

6. **Output**:
   - The output will be the integer value of the expression evaluated with the provided `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be:

Output: **int(((b - a) / 2) * (b - a + 1) + a * n)**
