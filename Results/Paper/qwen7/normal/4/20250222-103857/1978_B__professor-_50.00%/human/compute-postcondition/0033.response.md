Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where t is a positive integer. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the test cases according to the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (t cases) where each case involves three integers (n, a, b). However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, the function's role is to process these test cases without returning any value.
