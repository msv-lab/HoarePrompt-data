Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds the value 1.
