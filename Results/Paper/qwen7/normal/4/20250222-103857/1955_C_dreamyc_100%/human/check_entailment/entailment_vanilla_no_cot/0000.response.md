Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The logic used to calculate the number of ships sunk is incorrect. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of ships that would sink based on the sum of the durability of the ships at the start of each attack cycle, rather than simulating the actual attack process.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    queue = deque(range(n))  # Use a deque to simulate the first and last positions
    attacks = 0
    while k > 0 and queue:
        if k % 2 == 1:  # If there are remaining attacks, perform one on the first ship
            if nums[queue[0]] > 0:
                nums[queue[0]] -= 1
                if nums[queue[0]] == 0:
                    queue.popleft()  # Remove the ship from the queue if it sinks
                    attacks += 1
            k -= 1
        else:  # Perform an attack on the last ship
            if nums[queue[-1]] > 0:
                nums[queue[-1]] -= 1
                if nums[queue[-1]] == 0:
                    queue.pop()  # Remove the ship from the queue if it sinks
                    attacks += 1
            k -= 1
    return attacks
```

This corrected function uses a `deque` to manage the first and last positions of the ships and correctly simulates the attack process until either all ships have sunk or the attacks are exhausted.
