You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.
    #State: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of the elements in nums is greater than k.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the last `n // 2 + 1` elements if `n` is odd), `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the first `n // 2 - 1` elements if `n` is odd).
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. The variable `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first half of the list `nums` (or the first half minus one element if `n` is odd), and `s_b` accumulates the sum of the second half of the list `nums` (or the second half plus one element if `n` is odd). The variable `ans` is incremented each time either `s_a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to their respective thresholds `a` and `b`. Since the loop iterates over all elements of `nums`, `ans` will be equal to `n` if every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half satisfy their conditions.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is equal to `n` because every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half of the list `nums` satisfied their respective conditions during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the value of `n` or `ans`, which is equal to `n` if every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half of the list `nums` satisfy their respective conditions during the loop iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.

Case_2: The program returns `ans`, which is equal to `n` because every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half of the list `nums` satisfied their respective conditions during the loop iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
