Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 3, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2]`, `i` is 2, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]` if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial value of `ans` was 2, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
