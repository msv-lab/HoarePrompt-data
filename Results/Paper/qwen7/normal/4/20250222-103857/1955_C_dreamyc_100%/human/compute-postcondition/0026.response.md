Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 3, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2]`, `i` is 2, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]` if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`.

Explanation: If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, then `ans` is set to 3. There is no change in other variables, and the conditions on `ans`, `s_b`, `i`, and `s_a` are as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
