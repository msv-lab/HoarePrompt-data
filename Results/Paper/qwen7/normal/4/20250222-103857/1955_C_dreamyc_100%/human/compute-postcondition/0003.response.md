Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is `k // 2`.**

The code calculates `a` as the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` as the floor division of `k` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
