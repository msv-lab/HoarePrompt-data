Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk by summing the durability values from both ends of the list and checking against the number of attacks. This approach does not accurately reflect the process where ships sink and are no longer subject to further attacks.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
The correct sequence of events should be:
1. First attack: Ship 1 sinks (durability becomes 0), remaining ships: [2, 4, 3]
2. Second attack: Ship 3 sinks (durability becomes 0), remaining ships: [2, 4, 2]
3. Third attack: Ship 1 sinks (durability becomes 0), remaining ships: [4, 2]
4. Fourth attack: Ship 3 sinks (durability becomes 0), remaining ships: [4, 1]
5. Fifth attack: Ship 1 sinks (durability becomes 0), remaining ships: [4]

In this case, the correct number of ships sunk is 4, but the program incorrectly counts 2 ships sunk due to the incorrect summation logic.

The program should maintain a list of ships and simulate each attack, updating the durability and removing sunk ships from the list until all ships are either sunk or the attacks are exhausted.
