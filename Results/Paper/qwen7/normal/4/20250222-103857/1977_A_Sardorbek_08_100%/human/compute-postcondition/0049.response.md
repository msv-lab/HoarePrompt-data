Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases through `t`, where each test case includes integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, if `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 100, it processes these values; otherwise, it returns an error message indicating that `n` and `m` are out of the allowed range.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases indicated by `t`, and for each test case, it checks if `n` and `m` are within the specified range. If they are, it proceeds with some unspecified processing (not detailed here). If either `n` or `m` is outside the range, it returns an error message.
