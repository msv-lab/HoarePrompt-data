Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is the first integer entered.
- `c` is the second integer entered.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is not equal to `c`.
- The current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
