Reasoning:
- The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from input.
- The logic in the function checks several conditions:
  - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'.
  - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
  - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
1. The condition `if b == c:` correctly identifies when the number of moves (`b`) equals the desired number of cubes (`c`), which should result in 'Yes'.
2. The condition `elif b < c:` incorrectly identifies when it's impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes (`c`) with the given number of moves (`b`), which should also result in 'No'.
3. The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` checks if the number of moves and the desired number of cubes have the same parity, which is necessary but not sufficient. This condition alone does not cover all scenarios where it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
4. The final `else:` block should handle the remaining cases, but the current implementation prints 'No' in this block, which is incorrect.

To fix the logic, we need to ensure that:
- If `b` equals `c`, the answer is 'Yes'.
- If `b` is less than `c`, the answer is 'No'.
- If `b` is greater than `c` and they have the same parity, the answer is 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, the answer is 'No'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('Yes')
        elif b < c:
            print('No')
        elif b > c and b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Given the corrected logic, the function now correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes after `b` moves.

Correctness: **True**
