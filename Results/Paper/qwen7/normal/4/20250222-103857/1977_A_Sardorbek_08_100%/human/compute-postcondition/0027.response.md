Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
