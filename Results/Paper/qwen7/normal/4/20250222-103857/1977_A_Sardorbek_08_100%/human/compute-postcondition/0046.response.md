Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, and `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). Regardless of whether `b == c` is true or false, the value of `q` remains unchanged.***
