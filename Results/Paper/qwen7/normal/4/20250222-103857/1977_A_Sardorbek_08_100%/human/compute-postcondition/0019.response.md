Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is not equal to `c % 2`.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **No**
