Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, and `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). Regardless of the values of `b` and `c`, the value of `q` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `a`, since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variables `b` and `c` will hold the last pair of integers entered by the user during the loop's final iteration. The tuple `q` will contain these last values of `b` and `c`, and it will not change during any iteration of the loop.
