Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(a):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` is an integer from the input split.
   - `c` is an integer from the input split.
   - `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and it remains unchanged regardless of whether `b == c` or not.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `a`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `b` and `c` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`**.
