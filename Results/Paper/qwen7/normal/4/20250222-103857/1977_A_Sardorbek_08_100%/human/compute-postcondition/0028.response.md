Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

The code assigns a tuple `(b, c)` to the variable `q`. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
