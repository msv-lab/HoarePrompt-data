### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The task is to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Moves can either add or remove exactly one cube at a time.
- We need to check if the parity (even or odd nature) of `n` and `m` aligns and if `n` is sufficient to achieve `m`.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`.
- It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves.
- The conditions checked are:
  1. If `b` equals `c`, print 'YES'.
  2. If `b` is less than `c`, print 'NO'.
  3. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), print 'Yes'.
  4. Otherwise, print 'No'.

#### Analysis
1. **Case 1:** `b == c`
   - If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's trivially possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves by adding all cubes.
   - Correctly handled by printing 'YES'.

2. **Case 2:** `b < c`
   - It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - Correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

3. **Case 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
   - This condition checks if the number of additions and removals results in the same parity for the final count of cubes.
   - However, this alone is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes. For example, if `b = 3` and `c = 2`, `b % 2 == c % 2` holds true (both are odd), but it's impossible to have 2 cubes after 3 moves.

4. **Case 4:** `b > c` and `b % 2 == c % 2`
   - This condition should be checked to see if the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes.
   - The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

#### Correct Implementation
To correctly implement the logic, we need to ensure that:
- The number of moves (`b`) must be at least equal to the number of cubes (`c`).
- The parity of `b` and `c` must match.
- The exact number of moves should be sufficient to achieve `c` cubes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Verification
- **Test Case 1:** `3 3`
  - `b = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `b == c`, so the output is 'YES'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 2:** `2 4`
  - `b = 2`, `c = 4`
  - `b < c`, so the output is 'NO'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 3:** `5 3`
  - `b = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `b % 2 == c % 2` is false, so the output is 'NO'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 4:** `6 4`
  - `b = 6`, `c = 4`
  - `b % 2 == c % 2` is true and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, so the output is 'YES'.
  - Correct.

### Final Answer

Given the corrected implementation, the program now handles all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
