Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by either `diff1` or `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1. `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.
