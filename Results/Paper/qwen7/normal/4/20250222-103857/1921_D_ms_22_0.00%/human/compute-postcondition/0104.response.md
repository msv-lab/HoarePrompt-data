Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, and both `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, `t` is `t - 1`.**

This means that the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables (`max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
