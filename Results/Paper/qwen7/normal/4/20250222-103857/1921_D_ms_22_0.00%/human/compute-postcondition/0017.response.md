Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) is pushed into the max heap.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple containing `-diff1`, `i`, and `0` into a max heap. Since `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and given that `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, the value of `-diff1` will be less than `-diff2` (because `diff1 > diff2` implies `-diff1 < -diff2`). However, since we are pushing into a max heap, the tuple is added based on the first element of the tuple, which is `-diff1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
