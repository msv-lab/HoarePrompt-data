Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.
