Postcondition: `max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `ans` is updated according to the conditions: if the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (denoted as `diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (denoted as `diff2`), then `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2` and `tp2` is decreased by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the value of `-item[0]`, and either `tp1` is increased by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1 depending on the condition `item[2] == tp1`.
