Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] + 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, the value of `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Since `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `item[2]` is also incremented by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `max_heap`, and `item`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and conditions described in the initial state.
