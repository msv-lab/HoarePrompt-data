Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` will take each value from the list `a` during the loop iterations.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input()`, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element before the loop starts.
   - The other variables (`max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the list `a` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
