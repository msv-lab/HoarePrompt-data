Output State: **`ans` is increased by `diff2`, `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. The current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2` with `tp2` decreased by 1; `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff2` increases the value of `ans` by `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
