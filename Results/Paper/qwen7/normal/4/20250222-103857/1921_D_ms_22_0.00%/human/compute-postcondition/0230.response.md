Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the element at index `m-1` of `b`, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between the current value of `i` and the first element of `b`. The values of `i`, `diff2`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged from their previous states.
