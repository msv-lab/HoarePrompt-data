Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; a max heap contains a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0)**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a max heap using `heapq.heappush()`. Since `heapq.heappush()` adds elements to the heap, the heap now contains this new tuple. The values of `a`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The heap is a max heap, so the tuple is added such that `-diff1` is the key for comparison.
