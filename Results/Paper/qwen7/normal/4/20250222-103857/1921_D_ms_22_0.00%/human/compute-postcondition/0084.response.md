Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heappop()` function removes and returns the smallest element from the max-heap (which is actually the largest element due to the nature of a max-heap). After the function call, the `max_heap` does not contain the removed element, and the variable `item` holds the value of the removed element.
