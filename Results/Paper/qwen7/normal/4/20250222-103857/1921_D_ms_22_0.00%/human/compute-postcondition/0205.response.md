Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer less than its original value by 1 remains unchanged in terms of its description, but its actual value decreases by 1. However, since the exact value of `t` was not specified, we keep the description as it is. The variables `n` and `m` are newly introduced and hold the values of the user's inputs.
