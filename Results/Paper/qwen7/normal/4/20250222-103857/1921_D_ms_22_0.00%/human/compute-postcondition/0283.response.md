Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged with their respective descriptions.
