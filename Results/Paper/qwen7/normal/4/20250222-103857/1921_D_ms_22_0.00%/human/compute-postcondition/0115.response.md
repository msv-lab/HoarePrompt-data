Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

This means that `diff2` has been calculated as the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
