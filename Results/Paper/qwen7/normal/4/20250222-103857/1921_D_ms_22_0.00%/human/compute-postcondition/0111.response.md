Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`**.

The code simply updates the value of `tp2` to `m - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
