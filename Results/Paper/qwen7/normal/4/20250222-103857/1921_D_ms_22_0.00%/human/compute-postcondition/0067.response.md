Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`**.

This means that the highest value item from the `max_heap` has been removed and stored in the variable `item`. The `max_heap` is still non-empty, but it now lacks the highest value item that was just removed.
