Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the current `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. The values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `max_heap` now includes this new tuple along with any previously existing tuples.
