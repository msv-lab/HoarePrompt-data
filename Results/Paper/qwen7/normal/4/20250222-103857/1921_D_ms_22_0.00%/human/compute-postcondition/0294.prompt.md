Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning that every element in the list `a` has been processed. For each element `i` in `a`, the differences `diff1` (absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`) and `diff2` (absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`) were calculated. Based on these differences, tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` were pushed into the `max_heap`. After processing all elements in `a`, `max_heap` will contain up to `len(a)` such tuples, each representing the maximum difference found for each element in `a` with respect to the boundaries of `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

The final state of the variables is as follows:
- `t`: A positive integer less than its original value by the number of iterations (length of `a`).
- `n`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `m`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `a`: Unchanged, the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `b`: Unchanged, the list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `max_heap`: Contains up to `len(a)` tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.
- `tp1`: Remains 0.
- `tp2`: Remains `m - 1`.
- `ans`: Remains 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (otherwise); `tp1` is increased by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`; `ans` is further increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1` after the adjustments. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive) and does not equal `tp1`, then `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either `-item[0]`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1` (where `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by either `diff1` or `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1` (which is 1), then `ans` is not changed. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, and `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
