Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` is empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` holds the total minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b` (either the first or the last element). The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted to cover the entire range of indices in `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the following conditions will be met:

- `max_heap` will be empty because all items have been processed.
- `ans` will contain the sum of the minimum absolute differences found between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b` (either the first or the last element of `b`).
- `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted to cover the entire range of indices in `b` based on the logic inside the loop, ensuring that all elements in `b` are considered for the minimum difference calculation.

The final state of the variables will reflect the completion of the loop, with `t` being reduced by the length of `a`, and `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `tp1`, and `tp2` remaining as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
