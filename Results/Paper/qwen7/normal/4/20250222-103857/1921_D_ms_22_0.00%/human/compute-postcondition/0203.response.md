The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used to control the number of iterations. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `t > 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates that all items in `max_heap` have been processed, and `ans` holds the sum of the minimum absolute differences. This means that `t` must have been decremented to 0 during the iterations.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be set to a positive value greater than 0. Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust it accordingly.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
