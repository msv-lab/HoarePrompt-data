Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heappop()` function removes and returns the smallest element from the max-heap (which is treated as a min-heap internally). Since the initial state required `max_heap` to be non-empty, after popping the smallest element, `max_heap` no longer contains that item. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the smallest element that was removed from `max_heap`.
