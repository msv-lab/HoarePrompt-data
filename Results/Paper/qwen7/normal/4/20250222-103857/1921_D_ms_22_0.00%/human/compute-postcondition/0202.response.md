Based on the initial state provided, the `max_heap` will be empty after all iterations of the loop, and the variable `ans` will hold the sum of the minimum absolute differences found between elements of list `a` and either the first (`b[0]`) or the last (`b[m-1]`) element of list `b`.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the total minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of list a and either b[0] or b[m-1])**
