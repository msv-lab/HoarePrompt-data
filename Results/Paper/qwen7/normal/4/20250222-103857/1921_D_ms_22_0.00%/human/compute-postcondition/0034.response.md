Output State: **`i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is recalculated as abs(`i` - `b[0]`), `diff2` is abs(`i` - `b[m - 1]`), and a tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) has been pushed into `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple containing `-diff1`, `i`, and `0` into `max_heap`. The values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
