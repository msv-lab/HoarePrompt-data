Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It sorts the list b and then calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between each a_i and either the smallest or largest element in the sorted list b. The function returns the total minimum sum of these differences for each test case.**
