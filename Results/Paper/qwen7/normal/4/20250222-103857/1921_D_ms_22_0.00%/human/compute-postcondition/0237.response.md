Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial state of the variables to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

### Initial State:
- `t`: A positive integer less than its original value by the number of iterations (length of `a`).
- `n`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `m`: Unchanged, the input integer.
- `a`: Unchanged, the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `b`: Unchanged, the list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `max_heap`: Contains up to `len(a)` tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.
- `tp1`: Remains 0.
- `tp2`: Remains `m - 1`.
- `ans`: Remains 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

### Analysis:
- The only object in the loop head is `max_heap`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must not be empty.

### Conclusion:
Since `max_heap` contains up to `len(a)` tuples and the problem states that the loop has executed all iterations, `max_heap` must have at least one tuple before the loop starts. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `max_heap` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer less than its original value by the number of iterations (length of `a`), `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `max_heap` is not empty, `tp1` remains 0, `tp2` remains `m - 1`, and `ans` remains 0.**

However, since the only thing we need to ensure is that `max_heap` is not empty, and the problem guarantees that `max_heap` contains up to `len(a)` tuples, we can simply state:

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**.
