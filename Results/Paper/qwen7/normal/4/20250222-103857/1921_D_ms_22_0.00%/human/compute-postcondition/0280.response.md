Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The values of `diff1`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged from their initial states.
