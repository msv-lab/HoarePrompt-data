Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `ans` is `ans + diff1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been updated by adding `diff1` to its current value, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
