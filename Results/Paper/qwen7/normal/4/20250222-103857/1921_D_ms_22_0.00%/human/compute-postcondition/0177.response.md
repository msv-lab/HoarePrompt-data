Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is increased by 1**.

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. The initial state of `ans` being increased by `-item[0]` and `max_heap` not containing the item that was popped remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` retains its value from the initial state, and `tp1` is increased by 1.
