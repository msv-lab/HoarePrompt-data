Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `i` and either the first (`b[0]`) or last (`b[m-1]`) element of list `b`. The tuples are pushed into `max_heap` based on which difference (`diff1` or `diff2`) is larger during each iteration.**

This means that for every element `i` in list `a`, the loop calculates the absolute differences between `i` and the first and last elements of sorted list `b`. It then pushes the larger of these two differences (negated to simulate a max heap using Python's `heapq` which is a min heap by default) along with the corresponding index (either `0` or `m-1`) into `max_heap`. After all elements of `a` have been processed, `max_heap` will contain all such tuples, reflecting the largest differences found during each iteration.
