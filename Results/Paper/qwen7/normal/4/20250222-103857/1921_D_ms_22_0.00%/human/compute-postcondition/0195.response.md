Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_heap` still does not contain the item that was popped, `item` remains the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, and `ans` is still increased by `-item[0]`. The only change is that `tp2` is now one less than its previous value.
