Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` is the index in list `b` starting from `b[0]` and incremented when the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` is larger, and `tp2` is the index in list `b` starting from `b[-1]` and decremented when the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` is larger. The loop continues to pop items from `max_heap` until it is empty, updating `ans` and adjusting `tp1` and `tp2` according to the conditions provided.
