Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The approach taken in `func_1` simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times. This does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets will be subsequences of the generated string `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. One efficient way to do this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, but for simplicity, we can also construct the string by ensuring that every possible combination of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets appears as a subsequence.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import itertools

def generate_de_bruijn(k, n):
    def de_bruijn(k, n):
        cycle = list(range(k))
        path = []
        for _ in range(k ** n - 1):
            yield ''.join(map(str, cycle[-n:]))
            trans = cycle.pop()
            for _ in range(k - 1):
                cycle.append((trans * 10 + cycle[0]) % k)
            path.append(cycle.pop())
        yield ''.join(map(str, path))

    return next(de_bruijn(k, n))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    result = generate_de_bruijn(k, n)
    print(result)
```

This solution uses a de Bruijn sequence generator to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the generated string.
