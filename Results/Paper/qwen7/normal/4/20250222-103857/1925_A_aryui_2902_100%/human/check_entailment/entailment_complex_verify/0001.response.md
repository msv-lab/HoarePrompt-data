### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating a string \( s \) such that all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of \( s \).
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string when multiple solutions exist.

2. **Provided Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from input.
   - It then generates a string `s` consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z'), repeated \( n \) times.
   - For example, if \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `"abab"`.

3. **Evaluation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotation states that the function generates a string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the alphabet, repeated \( n \) times.
   - This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters will be present in \( s \). For instance, for \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the string "abab" is generated, but it does not contain "bb" as a subsequence.
   - The solution does not implement a de Bruijn sequence, which is necessary to ensure all possible subsequences of length \( n \) are included.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, one needs to construct a de Bruijn sequence of order \( n \) over an alphabet of size \( k \). A de Bruijn sequence of order \( n \) over an alphabet of size \( k \) is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length \( n \) appears exactly once as a substring.
   - The provided solution does not generate such a sequence; instead, it simply repeats the first \( k \) characters \( n \) times, which is insufficient to cover all possible subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution fails to meet the problem's requirements because it does not generate a string that includes all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the solution is incorrect due to the lack of a de Bruijn sequence construction.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not generate a string that satisfies the problem's requirements.
