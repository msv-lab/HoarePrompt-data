Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is an input integer with the current value being 1, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum between `x` and the current value of `bx` (-1). Since `x` is an input integer and its value is not specified, `bx` will take the higher value between `x` and -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
