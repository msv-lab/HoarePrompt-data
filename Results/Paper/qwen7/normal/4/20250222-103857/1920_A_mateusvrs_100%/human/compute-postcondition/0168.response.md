Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a non-empty set containing all the unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 1, `tmp` is 2, and the current value of `i` is the next unique `x` value in the set `cx`.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Initially, `tmp` was 1, so after executing this line, `tmp` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
