Postcondition: `t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
