Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is an input integer, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`. If `a` does not equal 1, `cx` includes `x` and `bx` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is either a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is a specific integer (either 1 or not 1), and `x` is a specific integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`; otherwise, `cx` becomes a set containing `x` and `ax` remains as `min(x, 1000000000)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `x` is an integer equal to the second input number. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a`. Otherwise, `cx` now contains the element `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
