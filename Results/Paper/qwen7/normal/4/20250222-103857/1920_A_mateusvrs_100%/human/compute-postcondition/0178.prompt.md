Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be 0, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `bx` is greater than `ax`. Otherwise, `i` is 7, `bx` is 3, `ax` is 8, `tmp` is 5, and `r` is a list containing the value 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0 and 0, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, and if `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` now contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the total count of `x` values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 0, and `tmp` reflects the count of `x` values in `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax` if `bx` is greater than `ax`; otherwise, `r` is [0, 0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
