Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the lower and upper bounds of `k`. `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007), and `bx` is initialized to -1.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there is no feasible value for `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total range length `(ax - bx + 1)`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Constraints:**
  - The program correctly identifies the lower and upper bounds (`bx` and `ax`) and handles the "not equal to" constraints by storing them in a set `cx`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The check `if bx > ax:` ensures that the solution space is valid. If `bx > ax`, there is no valid `k`, and the program correctly outputs 0.

- **Counting Valid Values:**
  - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly counts the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the invalid values stored in `cx` from the total range.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the constraints might overlap or intersect correctly.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
