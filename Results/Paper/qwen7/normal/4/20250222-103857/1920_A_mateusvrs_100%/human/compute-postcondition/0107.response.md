Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be an element of `cx`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value.
   - `i` is a value such that it satisfies the condition `i >= bx` and `i <= ax` (or it doesn't, but `tmp` remains unchanged).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `cx`, the next value of `i` must be another element of `cx`.
   - There is no specific requirement mentioned for `cx` to change, only that `i` must be an element of `cx`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is simply the value of `i` to be the next element in `cx`.

**State:**
- `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value.
- `i` is the next element in `cx`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `i` is the next element in `cx`**
