Postcondition: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is a specific integer (either 1 or not 1), and `x` is a specific integer. If `a` equals 2, then `cx` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cx` becomes a set containing `x`.
