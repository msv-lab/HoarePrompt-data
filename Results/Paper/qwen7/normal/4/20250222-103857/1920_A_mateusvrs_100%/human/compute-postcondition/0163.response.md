Postcondition: `t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a non-empty set containing all the unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 0, `tmp` is 0, and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.
