Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the set `cx`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the set `cx` must contain at least one element. If `cx` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `cx` is not empty for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`, and `tmp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cx` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`cx` must contain at least one element**
