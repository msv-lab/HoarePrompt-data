Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `r` remains an empty list, `n` must still be greater than 0, `cx` is still a set containing `x`, `ax` is still the minimum of `x` and `ax`, and `bx` is still -1. The values of `a` and `x` are now known to be the integers input by the user.
