Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer value, and `x` is the second input integer value.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after adding `x`, `cx` now contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
