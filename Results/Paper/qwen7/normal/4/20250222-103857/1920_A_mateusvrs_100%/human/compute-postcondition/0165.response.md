Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a non-empty set containing all the unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 1, `tmp` is 1, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` and less than or equal to the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs.**

Explanation: The line `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `tmp` was initially 0, after this operation, `tmp` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
