Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `x` is an integer equal to the second input number, `cx` now contains the element `x`**.

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` was already an integer equal to the second input number, after executing the code, `cx` will contain both `a` (the first input number) and `x` (the second input number).
