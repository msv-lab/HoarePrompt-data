Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the input values for `a` and `x` are not specified, they are left as "an input integer" in the output state.
