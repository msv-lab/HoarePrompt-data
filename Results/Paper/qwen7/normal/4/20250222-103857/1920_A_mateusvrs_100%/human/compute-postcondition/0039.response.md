Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be 0, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates, `tmp` is 0.**

The code initializes `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and `tmp` is simply set to 0.
