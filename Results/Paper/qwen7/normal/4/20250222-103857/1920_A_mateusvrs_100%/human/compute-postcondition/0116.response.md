Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0 and 0, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, and if `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` now contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the total count of `x` values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
