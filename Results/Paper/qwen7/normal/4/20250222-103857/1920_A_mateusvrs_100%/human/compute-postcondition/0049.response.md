Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cx:`. This means the loop iterates over the elements in the variable `cx`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 6
   - `bx` is 3
   - `ax` is 8
   - `tmp` is 4

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `cx` for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `cx`, the value of `i` will change with each iteration. However, the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `tmp` are not directly affected by the loop itself.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be assigned the next element from `cx`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `bx`, `ax`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of the next element in `cx` without knowing its contents. However, we know that for the loop to continue, `i` must be assigned the next element from `cx`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is 3, `ax` is 8, `tmp` is 4**
