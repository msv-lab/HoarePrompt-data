Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `x` is the second input integer value, `ax` is min(`x`, 1000000000)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum between `x` and the current value of `ax`. Since `ax` was initially 1000000000, `ax` will now be the smaller of `x` and 1000000000. The other variables remain unchanged.
