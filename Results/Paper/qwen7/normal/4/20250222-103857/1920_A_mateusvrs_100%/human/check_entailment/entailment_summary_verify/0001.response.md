### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly initializes `t` (number of test cases) and an empty list `r` to store results.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of constraints).
   - It uses sets and variables `ax` and `bx` to track the lower and upper bounds of valid `k` values, respectively.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to a set `cx` to track values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to `r` because no valid `k` exists.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within `[bx, ax]` from the total range `[ax, bx]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all specified scenarios and guarantees. However, there is a potential issue with the initialization of `ax` and `bx`.

- **Potential Issue:**
  - The variable `ax` is initialized to `int(1000000000.0 + 7)`, which is `1000000007`. This value is unnecessarily large and could potentially cause issues if the constraints involve smaller values.
  - The variable `bx` is initialized to `-1`, which is fine since it will be updated to the maximum value as constraints are processed.

To ensure correctness, `ax` should be initialized to a value that is smaller than any possible constraint value, such as `1`. This ensures that the initial comparison with `x` during the first iteration of the loop is meaningful.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = 1  # Initialize to 1 instead of 1000000007
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected initialization of `ax` to `1`, the program now correctly handles all constraints and guarantees. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.

**Final: True**
