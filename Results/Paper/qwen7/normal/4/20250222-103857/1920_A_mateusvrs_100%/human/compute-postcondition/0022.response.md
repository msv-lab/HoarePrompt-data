Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 2 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`, which is `-1`. Since `x` is an input integer, `bx` will be updated to the larger of `x` and `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
