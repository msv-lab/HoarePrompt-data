Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `x` is an integer equal to the second input number, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The line `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and its current value (`bx`). Since `bx` was not defined before, it defaults to `None` (or an unspecified value), and `max(x, None)` or `max(x, unspecified value)` would simply be `x`. Therefore, `bx` is updated to the value of `x`.
