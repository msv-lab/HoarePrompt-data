Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
