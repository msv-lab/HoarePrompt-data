Output State: **`L` must have at least one element, `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the value of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `L`, `tot`, or `k`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as the initial state.
