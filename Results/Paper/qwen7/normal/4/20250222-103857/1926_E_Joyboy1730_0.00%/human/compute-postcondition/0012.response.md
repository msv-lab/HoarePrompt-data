Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
