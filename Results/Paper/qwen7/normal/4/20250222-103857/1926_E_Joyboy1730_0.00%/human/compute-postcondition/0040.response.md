Postcondition: `L` must have at least two elements, `a` is the next element from `L`, `tot` is increased by `a`, `k` is decreased by `tot`, and `pow` is multiplied by 2. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above.
