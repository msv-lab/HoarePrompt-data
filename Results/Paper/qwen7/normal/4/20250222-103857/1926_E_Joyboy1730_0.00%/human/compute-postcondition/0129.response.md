Output State: `tot` is now `tot + a + a + a`, `k` is now `3 * (k - 3 * tot - 6 * a)`, `pow` is now `4 * 4 * 4`, and `pow` is equal to `64 * pow`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `tot` will be the sum of `a` added three times, `k` will be adjusted based on the total and the value of `a` added three times, `pow` will be multiplied by 2 three times, resulting in `pow` being equal to `64`.
