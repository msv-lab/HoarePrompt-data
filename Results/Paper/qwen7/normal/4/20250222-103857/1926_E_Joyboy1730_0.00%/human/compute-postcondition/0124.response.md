Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is now `2 * (k - tot - a)`, `pow` is now `pow * 2`, and we break out of the loop.**

This means that the value of `tot` has been updated to `tot + a`, the value of `k` has been updated to `2 * (k - tot - a)`, and the value of `pow` has been updated to `pow * 2`. Additionally, the loop has been broken out of, meaning no further iterations will occur.
