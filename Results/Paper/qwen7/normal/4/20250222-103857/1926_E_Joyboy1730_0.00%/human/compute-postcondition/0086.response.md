Output State: **`k` is now `k - (2*tot + a)`, `pow` is 8, `m` is 0, `tot` is `2*tot + a`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, and `n` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pow *= 2` doubles the value of `pow`. Since `pow` was initially 4, after executing the code, `pow` becomes 8. All other variables (`k`, `m`, `tot`, `a`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
