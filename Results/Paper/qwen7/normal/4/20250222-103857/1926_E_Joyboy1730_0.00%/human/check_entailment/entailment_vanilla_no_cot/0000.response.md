Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is not used in the subsequent logic. This part of the code is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Card Placement**: The program attempts to store values in `L` but does not actually use these values to determine the k-th card. Instead, it should directly calculate the position of the k-th card based on the described rules.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `k` and `tot`**: The variables `tot` and `k` are updated incorrectly. The logic for determining the k-th card should consider the sequence of cards laid down according to the rules provided.

### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        
        def get_kth_card(n, k):
            i = 1
            count = 0
            while True:
                # Number of cards that are i times an odd number
                num_cards = (n + 1) // (2 * i)
                if count + num_cards >= k:
                    # Find the exact position within the current group
                    offset = k - count
                    return i * (2 * (offset - 1) + 1)
                count += num_cards
                i += 1
        
        print(get_kth_card(n, k))

func()
```

This corrected version correctly implements the logic to find the k-th card based on the described rules.
