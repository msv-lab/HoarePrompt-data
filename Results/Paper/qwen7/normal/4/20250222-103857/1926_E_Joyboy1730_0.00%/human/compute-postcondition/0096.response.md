Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` will be \(\text{current k} - 1\), `n` will be \(\text{current n} - m\) and must be greater than `m`, `L` is an empty list, `m` is \((\text{current n} + 1) // 2\), `k` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the value of `m` based on the current value of `n`. The value of `n` is updated to \((\text{current n} + 1) // 2\). All other variables (`pow`, `tot`, `k`, `n` (after the update), `L`, `m`, `k`, and `n` (before the update)) remain in their respective conditions or states. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains valid.
