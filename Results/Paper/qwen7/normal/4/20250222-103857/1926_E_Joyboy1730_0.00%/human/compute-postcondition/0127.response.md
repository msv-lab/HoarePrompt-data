Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a + a`, `k` is now `3 * (k - 3 * tot - 3 * a)`, and `pow` is now `pow * 2`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `tot` is `tot + a + a`, `k` is `2 * (k - tot - a)`, and `pow` is `pow * 2`.
- The code `k -= tot` subtracts `tot` from `k`.
- Substituting the initial value of `tot` into the equation for `k`, we get `k` is now `2 * (k - (tot + a + a)) - tot`.
- Simplifying the expression, we get `k` is now `2 * (k - tot - a - a) - tot`, which further simplifies to `k` is now `2 * (k - tot - 2 * a) - tot`.
- Expanding the expression, we get `k` is now `2 * k - 2 * tot - 4 * a - tot`, which simplifies to `k` is now `2 * k - 3 * tot - 4 * a`.
- Since `tot` was initially `tot + a + a`, the updated expression for `k` becomes `k` is now `2 * k - 3 * (tot + a + a) - 4 * a`, which simplifies to `k` is now `2 * k - 3 * tot - 3 * a - 4 * a`, which further simplifies to `k` is now `2 * k - 3 * tot - 7 * a`.
- However, the correct simplified form considering the initial conditions is `k` is now `3 * (k - 3 * tot - 3 * a)`.
- The value of `pow` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.
