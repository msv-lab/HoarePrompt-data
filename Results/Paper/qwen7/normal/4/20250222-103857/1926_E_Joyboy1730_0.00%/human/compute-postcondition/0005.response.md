Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 5 â‹… 10^4, inclusive, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

This means that the value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
