Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` will be \(\text{current k} - 1\), `n` will be \(\text{current n} + 1\), `L` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `L`. This does not affect the values of `pow`, `tot`, `k`, or `n`. Therefore, the updated values for these variables remain as per the initial state.
