Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 16, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, `n` is 0**.

The code `tot = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tot`. Since `tot` was already 0 before this line, its value does not change. The values of `L`, `pow`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
