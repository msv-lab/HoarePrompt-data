Based on the initial state provided:

- `tot` is now `tot + a`
- `k` is now `k - tot`
- `pow` is now `pow * 2`
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

We need to determine the values of `pow * (2 * k - 1)` when the `print` statement is executed.

1. **Value of `pow`:** The value of `pow` is updated to `pow * 2`. Since no initial value of `pow` is given, let's denote it as `pow_initial`. After the update, `pow = pow_initial * 2`.

2. **Value of `k`:** The value of `k` is updated to `k - tot`. Here, `tot` is `tot + a`, so `k` becomes `k - (tot + a)`. Given that `tot` is updated after `a` is added, the exact value of `k` depends on its initial value and the value of `a`.

3. **Expression to print:** The expression to print is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.

Given the lack of specific initial values for `pow`, `k`, and `a`, we can only express the final printed value in terms of these variables.

Output: **pow_initial * 2 * (2 * (k - (tot + a)) - 1)**
