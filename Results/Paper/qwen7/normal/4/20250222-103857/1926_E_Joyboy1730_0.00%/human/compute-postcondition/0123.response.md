Based on the initial state and the final state provided, let's break down the values of the variables at the time of the `print` statement execution:

1. **`tot`**: It remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **`k`**: It remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
3. **`pow`**: It remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
4. **`a`**: Although not explicitly defined, it must have been used in the calculation of `tot` and `k` in the previous iteration.

Given the final state updates:
- `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.
- `k` is updated to `2 * (k - tot - a)`.
- `pow` is updated to `pow * 2`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` statement:
- `pow` is the value from the previous iteration multiplied by 2.
- `k` is the value from the previous iteration adjusted by the formula `2 * (k - tot - a)`.

Therefore, the expression `2 * k - 1` will be evaluated using the current value of `k` (which is `2 * (k - tot - a)`).

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 * pow * (2 * (k - tot - a) - 1)**
