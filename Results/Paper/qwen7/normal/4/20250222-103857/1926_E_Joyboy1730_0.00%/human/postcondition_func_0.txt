The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the relationship between \(n\) and \(k\) and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of values derived from the given inputs, ensuring that \(k\) is fully consumed or adjusted according to the loop's logic. The final state includes a list \(L\) containing at least \(t\) elements, where \(t\) is the number of test cases, and the variable \(pow\) is set to \(2^t\).
