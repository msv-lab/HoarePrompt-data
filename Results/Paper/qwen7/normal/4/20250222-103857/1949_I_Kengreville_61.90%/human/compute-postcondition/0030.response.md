Postcondition: **All disks will have their `visited[j]` value set to True. For every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is met and `visited[j]` was False before, then `coef0[j]` will be set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` will be set to `-coef1[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` will remain unchanged. The `dfs(j)` function will be called if the distance condition is met and `visited[j]` is False.**
