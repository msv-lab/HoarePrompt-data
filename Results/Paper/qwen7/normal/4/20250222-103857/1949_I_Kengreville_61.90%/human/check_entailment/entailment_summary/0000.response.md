Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if we can adjust the radii of disks such that:
   - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
   - No two disks overlap.
   - The total sum of the radii strictly decreases.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the number of disks `n` and their coordinates and radii.
   - It initializes some lists (`visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`) and an empty list `nodes`.
   - It iterates over each disk and performs a DFS if the disk has not been visited.
   - During DFS, it checks for tangency between disks and updates coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` accordingly.
   - If `coef1` is non-zero for any disk, it means we can decrease the radii of some disks while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total sum of radii.

3. **Analyzing `dfs`**:
   - This function performs a DFS starting from a given disk `i`.
   - It marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - For each unvisited disk `j` within the radius of disk `i` (indicating tangency), it updates the coefficients and recursively calls DFS on `j`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if there is at least one disk where `coef1` is non-zero.
   - If such a disk is found, it implies that the radii can be adjusted as required.
   - The DFS ensures that all relevant disks are checked and their relationships are considered.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
