Postcondition: `j` is 0; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`; if `visited[j]` is False and the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is satisfied, then `visited[j]` is set to True and `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. If the distance condition is not satisfied or `visited[j]` is already True, the values of `visited[j]`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.
