Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `dx` is `y[i] - y[0]`
   - `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`
   - `visited[j]` is True
   - Either `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, or `visited[j]` remains False.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain the same unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - `dx` and `dy` depend on the values of `y[i]`, `y[0]`, and `y[j]`. These values do not change within the loop head.
   - `visited[j]` was set to True for `j = 1`. For the next iteration (`j = 2`), `visited[j]` will be checked and updated accordingly.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `dx` and `dy` remain the same.
   - `visited[j]` will be checked and updated based on the loop body, but for the next iteration, it is not explicitly stated to change, so it remains True for now.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `dx` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is True, and either `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, or `visited[j]` remains False.**
