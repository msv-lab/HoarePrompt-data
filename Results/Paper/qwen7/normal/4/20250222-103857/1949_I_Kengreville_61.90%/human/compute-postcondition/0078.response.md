Output State: **The `nodes` list remains an empty list, `c0` remains unchanged (still 0), and `c1` remains 0.**

Explanation: The condition `ok = ok or c1 != 0` does not change the values of `c0` or `c1` because `c1` is still 0. The `nodes` list remains empty as no elements are added to it within the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
