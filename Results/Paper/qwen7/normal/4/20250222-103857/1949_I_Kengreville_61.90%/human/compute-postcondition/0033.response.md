Output State: **`nodes` is a non-empty list, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in the list `nodes`.**

Explanation: The variable `c1` is incremented by `coef1[j]`, where `j` is the next element in the list `nodes`. The value of `c0` is not affected by this line of code, and the list `nodes` remains unchanged.
