Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes` plus 1 (since `coef1[i]` was set to 1), and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[i]` is 0.**

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `n` still must be greater than 0, `nodes` is still a non-empty list, `c0` remains the same as it was initially defined, `c1` now includes the addition of 1 because `coef1[i]` was set to 1, and `ok` will be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. Also, `coef0[i]` remains 0.
