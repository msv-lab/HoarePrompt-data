Output State: **`j` is 1, `dx` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is False, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`**.

In this output state, the value of `j` remains 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged as they are still defined as `y[i] - y[0]` and `y[i] - y[j]` respectively. The value of `visited[j]` remains False. The new value of `coef0[j]` is calculated as `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`.
