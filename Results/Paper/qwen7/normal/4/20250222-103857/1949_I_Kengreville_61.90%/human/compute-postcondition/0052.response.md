Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, which iterates over the elements in the list `nodes`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `nodes`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nodes` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` iterates over the elements of `nodes`, and the loop continues as long as `nodes` contains elements, the only thing that changes is the value of `j` and potentially the value of `c1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` would have taken one of the values from `nodes`, and `c1` would have been updated accordingly.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will take the next value from `nodes`, and `c1` will be updated again.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `nodes` still contains at least one element (since the loop would stop if it were empty).
   - `c1` will be increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.

Given that `nodes` must contain at least one element and `c1` is updated based on the current value of `j`, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least two elements, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`**.
