Output State: **`j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is True, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j] is `-coef1[i]`, and the function dfs(j) is called.**

The code `dfs(j)` calls the function `dfs` with the argument `j`. Since the function call itself does not assign any new values to the existing variables or change their states, the values of `j`, `dx`, `dy`, `visited[j]`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is that the function `dfs` is invoked with `j` as its parameter.
