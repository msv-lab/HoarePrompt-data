The function accepts an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y` of length `n` containing integers, representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of disks, and a list `r` of length `n` containing integers representing the radii of the disks. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the disks to determine if there exists at least one disk where the coefficient `coef1` is non-zero. If such a disk is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the `visited` and `coef0`, `coef1` lists during its execution.
