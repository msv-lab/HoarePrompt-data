Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Missing `dfs` function call**: The `dfs` function is defined but never called in the `func_1` function.
2. **Incorrect logic for determining if the sum of radii can be decreased**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly check if it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.
3. **Potential issues with coefficient calculation**: The coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) are calculated in a way that might not accurately reflect the necessary changes in radii to satisfy the problem constraints.

To properly solve this problem, you need to ensure that:
- You correctly identify which disks are tangent to each other.
- You calculate the necessary changes in radii to maintain tangency and non-overlapping conditions.
- You verify that the sum of the new radii is strictly less than the original sum.

Here is a revised approach to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def can_decrease_radii(disks):
    n = len(disks)
    # Create a graph where edges represent tangency between disks
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            xi, yi, ri = disks[i]
            xj, yj, rj = disks[j]
            dx = xi - xj
            dy = yi - yj
            dist = (dx ** 2 + dy ** 2) ** 0.5
            if dist == ri + rj:
                graph[i].append(j)
                graph[j].append(i)

    def dfs(node, parent, current_sum, remaining_r):
        nonlocal ok
        if not ok:
            return
        remaining_r -= disks[node][2]
        current_sum -= disks[node][2]
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor != parent:
                dfs(neighbor, node, current_sum, remaining_r)

    ok = True
    for i in range(n):
        if not ok:
            break
        if len(graph[i]) > 0:
            dfs(i, -1, sum(r for _, _, r in disks), sum(r for _, _, r in disks))

    return ok and remaining_r < 0

n = int(input())
disks = []
for _ in range(n):
    x, y, r = map(int, input().split())
    disks.append((x, y, r))

print('YES' if can_decrease_radii(disks) else 'NO')
```

This solution constructs a graph where edges represent tangency between disks. It then uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore possible ways to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of the radii decreases.
