Postcondition: `j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, and `visited[j]` is True. If `not visited[j]` and \((r[i] + r[j])^2 == dx^2 + dy^2\), then `dfs(j)` is called, and `coef0[j]` becomes \(r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]\) and `coef1[j]` becomes \(-coef1[i]\). If the condition is not met, `visited[j]` remains True, and `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` retain their original values.
