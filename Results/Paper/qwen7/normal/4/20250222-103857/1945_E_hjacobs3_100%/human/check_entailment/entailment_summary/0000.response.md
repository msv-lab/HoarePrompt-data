Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation such that the element `x` is at the `l`-th position after performing binary search.
2. The provided program attempts to perform this task using a binary search-like approach but has several issues:
   - The binary search is not correctly implemented. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized incorrectly (`l = 0` and `r = n` instead of `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`).
   - The binary search loop condition is incorrect (`r - l > 1` instead of `r - l > 0`).
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed; it does not correctly update `l` and `r` to narrow down the search range.
   - The function `func_1` only checks if `find` is already at the correct position and does not attempt to rearrange the array if necessary.
   - The function does not handle the case where `find` is not in the array.
3. The execution summary describes a different behavior than what the code actually does. The summary mentions printing `1` when `find` is not present, which is not reflected in the actual implementation.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
