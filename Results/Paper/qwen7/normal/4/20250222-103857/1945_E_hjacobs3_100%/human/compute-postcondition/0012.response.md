Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` and `r` must satisfy `r - l > 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `r` is equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `r = mid` updates the value of `r` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. All other variables (`array`, `n`, `l`, and the calculation for `mid`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
