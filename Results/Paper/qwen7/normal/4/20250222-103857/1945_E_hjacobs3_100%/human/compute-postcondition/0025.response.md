Output State: **The program returns a list containing 'l + 1' and 'array.index(find) + 1' as strings.**

Given the initial state and the code snippet:
- `l` is equal to `r` minus one.
- Both `l` and `r` point to indices within the list `array`.
- The value of `array[l]` will be either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find` depending on the final comparison inside the loop.
- The variable `mid` will be the integer result of `(l + r) // 2` during the last iteration of the loop, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l` and `r`.
- The condition `(l != array.index(find))` is true.

The code snippet returns a list with two elements:
1. `str(l + 1)` - This is the value of `l` incremented by 1, converted to a string.
2. `str(array.index(find) + 1)` - This is the index of `find` in the list `array`, incremented by 1, and converted to a string.

Since the exact values of `l` and `find`'s index are not specified, we express the return value in terms of these variables.
