Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `r - l > 1` must be true.
   - Given `l = 0` and `r = n`, the condition becomes `n - 0 > 1` or `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `l` and `r`. Since `l` is fixed at 0, the only variable that needs adjustment is `r`.
   - To satisfy the condition `n > 1`, `n` (which is the same as `r` in this context) must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` (or `r`) is greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n and n must be greater than 1**
