You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `l` will be equal to `r` minus one, and both `l` and `r` will point to indices within the list `array`. The value of `array[l]` will be either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find` depending on the final comparison inside the loop. The variable `mid` will be the integer result of `(l + r) // 2` during the last iteration of the loop, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l` and `r`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `l` will be one less than `r`, and they will both indicate the boundaries where the target value `find` would be located if it exists in the list `array`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing 'l + 1' and 'array.index(find) + 1' as strings.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` will be equal to `r` minus one, and both `l` and `r` will point to indices within the list `array`. The value of `array[l]` will be either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find` depending on the final comparison inside the loop. The variable `mid` will be the integer result of `(l + r) // 2` during the last iteration of the loop, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l` and `r`. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing the string representation of 'l + 1' and 'array.index(find) + 1'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing 'l + 1' and 'array.index(find) + 1' as strings.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
