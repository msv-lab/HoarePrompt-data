Postcondition: **`l` will be equal to `r` minus one, and both `l` and `r` will point to indices within the list `array`. The value of `array[l]` will be either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find` depending on the final comparison inside the loop. The variable `mid` will be the integer result of `(l + r) // 2` during the last iteration of the loop, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l` and `r`. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.**
