### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange a permutation array such that after performing a binary search, the element `x` is found at the position `l`.
- The binary search should be performed on a sorted version of the array, but we can perform up to 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` performs a binary search on the array.
- If `find` is present in the array, it returns the 1-based indices of `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`.
- If `find` is not present, it prints `1` and returns the same list of indices.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation array `array`.

2. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The program calls `func_1` with the permutation array and the target value `x`.
   - If `func_1` returns a result, it prints the result.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `t` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` performs a binary search on the array.
   - If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and returns the indices `[l + 1, array.index(find) + 1]`.
   - This implies that the function assumes `find` is present in the array and tries to move it to the correct position using a single swap.

#### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `find` is not present in the array.
- The function incorrectly assumes that a single swap is sufficient to place `find` at the correct position.
- The function does not account for the possibility that two swaps might be necessary to ensure `find` is at the correct position.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  5 4 3 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  4 5
  1 4
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Explanation:
  - The element `3` is not at position `l` (which starts at 0).
  - The function does not perform any swaps to move `3` to position `l`.
  - Therefore, the output is incorrect.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where `find` is not present in the array.
- The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps to ensure `find` is at the correct position.
- The program fails to meet the requirement of ensuring that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `find` is not present in the array and does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.
