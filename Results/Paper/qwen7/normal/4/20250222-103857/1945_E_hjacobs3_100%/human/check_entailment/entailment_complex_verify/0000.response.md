### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
2. We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.
3. The binary search algorithm should be applied to the modified permutation.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function performs a binary search on the input array.
   - After the binary search, it checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and returns the indices `[l + 1, array.index(find) + 1]`.
   - If `array[l]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0`.

2. **Issues with the Current Implementation:**
   - The function does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position `l` after the binary search.
   - The function assumes that the element `x` is present in the array, but it does not handle the case where `x` is not present.
   - The function only checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x` and does not attempt to move `x` to the correct position if necessary.

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - Given input:
     ```
     1
     5 3
     5 4 3 2 1
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     2
     4 5
     1 4
     ```
   - Actual output:
     ```
     0
     ```
   - Explanation: The element `3` is not at position `l` (which starts at 0), and the program does not perform any swaps to move `3` to position `l`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of ensuring that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, we need to:
     - Perform the binary search.
     - Check if `array[l]` is equal to `x`.
     - If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, we need to find the correct position for `x` and perform the necessary swaps.

#### Corrected Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to:
1. Perform the binary search.
2. Check if `array[l]` is equal to `x`.
3. If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, find the correct position for `x` and perform the necessary swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Find the correct position for find
    pos = array.index(find)
    
    # If l is not the correct position, perform swaps
    if l != pos:
        # Swap l and pos
        array[l], array[pos] = array[pos], array[l]
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(pos + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
        return []
```

With this corrected implementation, the function ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position `l` after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the corrected implementation, the original assessment was accurate.

Final: **False**
