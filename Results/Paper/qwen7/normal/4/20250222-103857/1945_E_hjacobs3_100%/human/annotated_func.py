#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ find â‰¤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `l` will be equal to `r` minus one, and both `l` and `r` will point to indices within the list `array`. The value of `array[l]` will be either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find` depending on the final comparison inside the loop. The variable `mid` will be the integer result of `(l + r) // 2` during the last iteration of the loop, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l` and `r`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `l` will be one less than `r`, and they will both indicate the boundaries where the target value `find` would be located if it exists in the list `array`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing 'l + 1' and 'array.index(find) + 1' as strings.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` will be equal to `r` minus one, and both `l` and `r` will point to indices within the list `array`. The value of `array[l]` will be either less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find` depending on the final comparison inside the loop. The variable `mid` will be the integer result of `(l + r) // 2` during the last iteration of the loop, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l` and `r`. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `array` (representing a permutation of length `n`) and an integer `find` (such that 1 â‰¤ `find` â‰¤ `n`). It performs a binary search to find the position of `find` in `array`. If `find` is present in `array`, it returns a list containing the 1-based indices of `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` as strings. If `find` is not present, it prints `1` and returns the same list of indices.
