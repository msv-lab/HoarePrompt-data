Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `r` must satisfy `r - l > 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is reassigned to the value of `mid`. The other variables (`array`, `n`, `r`, and `mid`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
