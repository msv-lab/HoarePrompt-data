Reasoning:
1. The provided code attempts to solve the problem by performing at most 2 swaps to make the element `x` appear at the index `l` after the binary search. However, the current implementation of the `func_1` function does not correctly perform the required swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.
2. The binary search logic is implemented correctly, but the approach to finding the necessary swaps is flawed. Specifically, the function only checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array and performs one swap if this condition is true. This does not guarantee that the element `x` will be moved to the correct position `l` after the binary search.
3. The problem statement guarantees that 2 operations are always sufficient, but the current implementation does not account for all possible scenarios where 2 swaps might be needed. For instance, if `x` is not present in the array or is not in the correct position even after the first swap, the function should still be able to handle this case.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
