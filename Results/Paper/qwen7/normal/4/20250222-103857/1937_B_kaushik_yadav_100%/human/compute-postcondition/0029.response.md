Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Given the current state: `i` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string, and `work` is a boolean.
   - Since `i` is an integer and `len(a)` is a constant (the length of the string `a`), the only way to ensure the loop continues is to increment `i` such that `i < len(a)` remains true.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 and still satisfies the condition `i < len(a)`.
   - Therefore, we need to set `i` to `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < len(a)`.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` should be incremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string, and `work` is a boolean.**
