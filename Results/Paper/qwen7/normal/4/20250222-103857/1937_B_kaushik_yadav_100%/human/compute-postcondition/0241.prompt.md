Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits; `i` is 0; `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. `i` is either 4 or 2 depending on the condition inside the if-else block. `work` is either True or False based on the condition inside the if-else block. `len(a)` must be greater than 0. `ans` is either `a[2]` if `work` is True and the condition `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` is true, or the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. `i` is either 4 or 2 depending on the condition inside the if-else block. `work` is either True or False based on the condition inside the if-else block. `len(a)` must be greater than 0. `ans` is now the concatenation of `ans` and `a[i]` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the concatenation of `ans` and `b[i]` if `i + 1 == len(a)` or `ans` is the character at index `i` of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits. `i` is either 4 or 2 depending on the condition inside the if-else block. `work` is either True or False based on the condition inside the if-else block. `len(a)` must be greater than 2. `ans` is now the concatenation of `ans` and `a[i]` if the condition `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` is met, or `ans` is now the concatenation of `ans` and `b[i]` if the condition `i + 1 == len(a)` is met, or `ans` is now the concatenation of `ans` and `b[i]` if the condition `i + 1 < len(a)` is not met and `work` is False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
