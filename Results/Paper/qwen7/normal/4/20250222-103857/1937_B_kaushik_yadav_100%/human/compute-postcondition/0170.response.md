Postcondition: **`counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` initially, and `a[j + 2]` equals `b[j + 1]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 2]` equals `b[j + 1]`; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 2]` does not equal `b[j + 1]` and the condition `a[j + 2] == '0' and b[j + 1] == '1'` is false. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, `t`) retain their original states, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
