Output State: **`counter` is either 3 or 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `counter` or `j`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `t`) retain their original states.
