Output State: **`work` is False, `i` is 2, `ans` is `a[1]`, the current value of `b[i]` is less than the current value of `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and the relationship between `b[i]` and `a[i + 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
