Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is the concatenation of its original value and `b[i]`, `work` is True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` concatenates the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, `i` must be the last index of `a` (since `a` has no leading or trailing spaces). After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `ans` is updated to include the character at index `i-1` (which was the last character of `a`). All other variables remain unchanged.
