Postcondition: **`counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits; `i` is 4; `work` is True; `len(a)` must be greater than 0; `ans` is the value of `a[i]` which is `a[2]`; if the condition `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` is true, then `work` is False, `i` is 2, and `ans` is `a[1]`.**
