Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i-1]` appended to it, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, and `work` remains unchanged. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated based on whether `i + 1` equals `len(a)` or not.
