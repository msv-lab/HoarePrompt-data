Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes the first character of `b`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the nature of the iteration or the context). All other variables remain unchanged.
