Postcondition: `counter` is either 4 or 2 if the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met during the last iteration; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is met during any iteration before the loop exits; `i` is 1; `work` is True; `len(a)` must be greater than 0; `ans` is the value of `a[i]` which is `a[0]`; `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.
