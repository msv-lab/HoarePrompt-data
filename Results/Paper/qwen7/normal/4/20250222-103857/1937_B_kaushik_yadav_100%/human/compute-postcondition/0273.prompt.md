Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop, `j` is 1, and `a[j + 1]` is either equal to `b[j]` (in which case `counter` becomes 2) or not equal to `b[j]` (in which case `counter` remains 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop, `j` is 3, and if `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` becomes 2; otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` becomes 2; otherwise, the loop or if statement ends.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop, `j` is 4, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
