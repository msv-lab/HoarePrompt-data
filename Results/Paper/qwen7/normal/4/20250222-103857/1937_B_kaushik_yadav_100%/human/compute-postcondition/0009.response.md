Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces.
   - `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input.
   - `ans` is an empty string.
   - `work` is True.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - We need to ensure that `len(a)` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, so `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0**.
