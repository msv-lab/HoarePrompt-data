Output State: **`work` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i-1]` appended to it, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input.**

Explanation: The line `work = False` sets the boolean variable `work` to `False`. The values of `i`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
