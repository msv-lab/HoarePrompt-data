Output State: **`counter` is 1, `a[j + 2]` is equal to `b[j + 1]` if the initial condition was met, otherwise it is 1; all other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, `t`) retain their original states.**

Explanation: The code sets `counter` to 1 regardless of its initial value. Since the initial state specified that `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 2]` is equal to `b[j + 1]`, and 1 otherwise, setting `counter` to 1 overrides the initial condition. Therefore, `counter` is now 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.
