Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `b[i-1]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially `i + 1`, after the increment, `i` becomes `i + 2`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work` remain unchanged.
