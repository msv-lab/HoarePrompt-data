Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` (which is `data[0]` since `idx` is 0) to `t` after converting it to an integer. The value of `idx` remains unchanged.
