Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is equal to `data[0]`, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    result = func_1(a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)` and the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 2`, `results` is a list containing three elements which are the first two elements plus the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - 1` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
