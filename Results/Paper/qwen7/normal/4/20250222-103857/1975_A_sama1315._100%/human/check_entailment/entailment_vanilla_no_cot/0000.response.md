Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if the array can be made sorted by checking if any rotation of the array matches the sorted version of the array. However, this approach does not account for the specific operation defined in the problem, which involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is less than or equal to the second part when concatenated back together. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[:i+1] <= a[i+1:]:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution iterates through all possible splits of the array and checks if the first part is less than or equal to the second part. If such a split exists, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
