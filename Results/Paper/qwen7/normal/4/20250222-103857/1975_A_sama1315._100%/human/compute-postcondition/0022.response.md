Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)` and the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - 1` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was `idx + n + 1`. After the increment, `idx` becomes `idx + n + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
