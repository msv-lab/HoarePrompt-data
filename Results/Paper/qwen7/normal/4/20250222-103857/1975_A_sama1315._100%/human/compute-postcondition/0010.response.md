Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n` to integers.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is now `idx + n`, and the other variables (`t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, and `a`) retain their original conditions and values.
