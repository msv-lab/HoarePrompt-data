Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n` to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `a` by converting the slice of `data` starting from index `idx` (which is 3) and having length `n` to integers using the `map` function combined with `int`. The values of `t`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged except for the creation of the new list `a`.
