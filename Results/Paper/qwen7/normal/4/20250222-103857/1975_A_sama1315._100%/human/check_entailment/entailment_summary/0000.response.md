Reasoning:
- The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
- The provided solution uses `func_2` to read and process multiple test cases.
- For each test case, `func_2` calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted using the described operation.
- `func_1` checks if the original array can be rearranged to match its sorted version by finding a sub-array in the concatenated version of the array that matches the sorted array.
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed because:
  - It checks if any sub-array of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, but this does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
  - For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Concatenating the array gives `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, and a sub-array `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]` exists, but the array cannot be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
- The correct approach would involve checking if the array is already non-decreasing or if it can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. This involves verifying if the array is non-decreasing up to a certain point and then non-increasing from that point onwards.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
