### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them any number of times.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
   - It works by concatenating the array with itself (`a + a`), sorting the original array (`sorted_a`), and then checking if any segment of the concatenated array matches the sorted array.
   - The logic is flawed because:
     - Concatenating the array with itself does not guarantee that any split and swap will make the array non-decreasing.
     - The function should instead check if the array is already non-decreasing or if any rotation of the array can make it non-decreasing.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The input reading and processing logic is correct but relies on `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The core issue lies in `func_1`. The current implementation does not correctly determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
   - A correct approach would involve checking if the array is already non-decreasing or if any cyclic shift of the array can make it non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: **False**
