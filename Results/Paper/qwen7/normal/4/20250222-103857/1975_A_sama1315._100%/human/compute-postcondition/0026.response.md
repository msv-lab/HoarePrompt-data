Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 2`, `results` is a list containing three elements which are the first two elements plus the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - 1` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(a)`) to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained two elements, after appending `result`, it now contains three elements. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
