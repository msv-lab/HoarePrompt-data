Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(t)`. This means the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, but the loop itself depends on the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
   - `idx` is `idx + n + 1`
   - `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)` and the previous element
   - `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, and `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` should be `t - 1`.
   - All other variables (`data`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `result`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)` and the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**
