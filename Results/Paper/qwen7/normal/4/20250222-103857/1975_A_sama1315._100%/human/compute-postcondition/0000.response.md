Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. Array `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read` for reading input.**

This code replaces the standard input method with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a single string. However, it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the array `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
