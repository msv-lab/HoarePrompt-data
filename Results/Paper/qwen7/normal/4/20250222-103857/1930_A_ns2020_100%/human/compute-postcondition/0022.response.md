Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of cases, then an integer `n`, and a sequence of `2n` integers. It sorts the sequence of integers and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element. Finally, it prints this sum for each test case and reduces `t` until it reaches zero.**
