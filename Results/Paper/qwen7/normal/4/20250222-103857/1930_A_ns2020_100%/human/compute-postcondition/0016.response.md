Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `A` is updated to be its sorted version.
