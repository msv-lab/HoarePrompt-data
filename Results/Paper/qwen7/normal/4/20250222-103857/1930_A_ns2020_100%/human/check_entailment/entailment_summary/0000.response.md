Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the sequence of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting the Sequence**: It sorts the sequence of integers. Sorting helps in pairing the smallest available numbers together, which is optimal for maximizing the score because \(\min(x, y)\) will be maximized when \(x\) and \(y\) are as close as possible.
3. **Summing Every Second Element**: After sorting, it sums every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, leading to the highest possible score.
4. **Output**: The sum is printed for each test case, and the process repeats for the remaining test cases.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly follows the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
