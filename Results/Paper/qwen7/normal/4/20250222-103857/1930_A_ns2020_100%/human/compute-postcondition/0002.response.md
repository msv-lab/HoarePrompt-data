Output State: **`t` is a value between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The initial state sets `t` to an integer input value within the range of 1 to 5000. The code then takes another integer input and assigns it to `n`. The precondition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000` remains valid after the execution of the code.
