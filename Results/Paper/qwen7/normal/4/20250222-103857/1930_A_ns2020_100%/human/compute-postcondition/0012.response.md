Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially a non-zero value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), after decrementing by 1, `t` will now be a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged.
