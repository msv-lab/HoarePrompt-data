Output State: **`t` is a value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially a value between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), after decrementing by 1, `t` now ranges from 0 to 4999 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged.
