Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard. By sorting the list and summing every second element (i.e., `A[::2]`), the program ensures that the minimum of the pairs is always added to the score. This approach guarantees the maximum possible score because it minimizes the loss at each step.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Sorting the list and summing every second element ensures that the score is maximized regardless of the order of the input numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
