The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers \(t\), \(n\), and \(m\) along with two binary strings \(a\) and \(b\). It then finds the smallest index \(k\) in string \(e\) (which is initially assigned the value of string \(d\)) such that the substring of \(e\) starting from index \(k\) contains all characters of \(d\) in the same order as they appear in \(d\). If no such \(k\) exists, it returns the length of \(d\). The function prints the value of \(k\) for each test case.
