Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j + 1 + k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `b`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `b` must be greater than 0 remains valid. We also note that the `break` statement indicates that we have exited the most internal loop or conditional block.
