Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is equal to `b-1`, `b` is greater than 0, and `k` is either `c` (if `j` equals `b-1`) or `k` is set to `b` (if `k` does not equal `c` and `j` does not equal `b-1`).**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `j` will be `b-1` because the loop increments `j` in each iteration. The variable `k` will be set to `c` if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is met during any iteration, which would cause an early break. If neither condition is met throughout the loop's execution, `k` will be set to `b` right before breaking out of the loop.
