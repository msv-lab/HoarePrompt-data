Output State: **`k` is equal to `j`, and `j` retains its original value**.

In this case, the code `k = j` assigns the current value of `j` to `k`. This does not change the value of `j`, but it does create a new value for `k` that is identical to the value of `j` before the assignment. Therefore, both `k` and `j` are included in the output state, with `k` explicitly showing the relationship to `j`.
