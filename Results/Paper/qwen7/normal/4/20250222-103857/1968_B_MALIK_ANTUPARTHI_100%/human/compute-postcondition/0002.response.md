Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an integer from input, `c` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `b` and `c`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer from the initial state.
