Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is set to `low`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.
