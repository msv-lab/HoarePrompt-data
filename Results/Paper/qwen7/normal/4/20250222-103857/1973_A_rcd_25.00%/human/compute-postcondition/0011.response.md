Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input, their values are determined by the user input. However, the specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, but we know that their sum plus `p3` must be odd. This means that if `p1 + p2` is even, `p3` must be odd, and vice versa.

Regardless of the specific values of `p1` and `p2`, the print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers obtained from the input split by spaces)**
