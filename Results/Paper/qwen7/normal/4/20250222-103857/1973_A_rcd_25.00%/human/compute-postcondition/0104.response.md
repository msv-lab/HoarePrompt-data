Output State: The loop will terminate after all iterations, printing the value of `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`. Since `cur` starts as either `low` or `high` and increases by 1 with each iteration, and given that `high` is initially set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the loop will eventually increment `cur` to a value greater than `high`.

This means that the final output state will be the result of the `else` block inside the loop, which prints `p3` when `cur` exceeds `high`.

In natural language, the output state after all loop iterations is that the program will print the value of `p3`.
