Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented to 0 by the end of the loop. For each iteration, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. The variable `cur` is updated within the inner while loop based on the conditions provided, and depending on whether the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, either `p1 - cur + p3` or `p3` is printed. If the condition is never met throughout all iterations, `p3` is printed at the end of the loop.

In summary, after all iterations, `t` is 0, and the loop has processed all inputs, printing either `p1 - cur + p3` when the specified condition is met or `p3` when it is not.
