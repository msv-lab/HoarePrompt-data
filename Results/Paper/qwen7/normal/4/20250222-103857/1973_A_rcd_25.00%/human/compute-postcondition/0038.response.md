Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is less than `p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is greater than `p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, and `cur` equals `high`.
