Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration, and we continue the loop, or the program will print the value of `p3` after all loop iterations.**
