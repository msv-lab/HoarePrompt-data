Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with the additional condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `low` to the variable `cur`. Since `low` is defined as `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `cur` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
