Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `cur` does not equal `high`. The loop will print `p3` when `cur` equals `high`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, it needs to be adjusted.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1 because the loop runs `t` times.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration.

5. **Conclusion**: The only change needed is to ensure `t` remains greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration**.
