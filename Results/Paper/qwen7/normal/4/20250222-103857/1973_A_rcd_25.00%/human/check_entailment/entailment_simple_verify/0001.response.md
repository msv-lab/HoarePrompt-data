### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct.

3. **Checking Feasibility of Scores:**
   - The program then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the scores can be achieved through one win and one draw, but the current logic would incorrectly print `2` instead of `1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition fails, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to the minimum and maximum possible values for the number of draws.
   - A loop is used to incrementally check the number of draws until the condition is met.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to ensure that the scores are achievable with the current number of draws.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. This logic is also incorrect because it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and edge cases.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case: `1 1 1`**
  - The sum is even, but `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should handle this case differently, but it currently prints `-1` directly without further checks.

- **Test Case: `1 1 2`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of one win and one draw, but it incorrectly prints `2`.

### Correct Binary Search Logic:

To correctly calculate the maximum number of draws, we need to ensure that the scores can be achieved with the given constraints. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Calculate the total points contributed by wins and draws.
2. Use a binary search to find the maximum number of draws that can be achieved.

Here's the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
            continue
        
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        max_draws = total_points // 2 - (p3 - p1 - p2)
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Logic:

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total points contributed by wins and draws: `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated as: `max_draws = total_points // 2 - (p3 - p1 - p2)`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `max_draws` is negative, it means the scores are not achievable, so print `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate. The given program has logical errors in handling the conditions and calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
