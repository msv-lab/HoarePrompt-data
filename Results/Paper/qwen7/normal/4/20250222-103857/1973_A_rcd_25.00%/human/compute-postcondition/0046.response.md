Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration and are not directly relevant to the print statement.

The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since `p1` and `p2` are integers obtained from the input, their exact values depend on the user input, but we know they are part of a set of three integers whose sum is odd. This means one of them must be even, and the other two must either both be odd or one be even and the other odd to make their sum odd.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers obtained from the input split by spaces)**
