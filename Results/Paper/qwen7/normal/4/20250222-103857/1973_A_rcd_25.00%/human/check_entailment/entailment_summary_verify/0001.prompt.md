You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where for each case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is reduced to `0`, indicating all inputs have been processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct.

3. **Checking Feasibility of Scores:**
   - The program then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the scores can be achieved through one win and one draw, but the current logic would incorrectly print `2` instead of `1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition fails, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to the minimum and maximum possible values for the number of draws.
   - A loop is used to incrementally check the number of draws until the condition is met.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to ensure that the scores are achievable with the current number of draws.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. This logic is also incorrect because it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and edge cases.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case: `1 1 1`**
  - The sum is even, but `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should handle this case differently, but it currently prints `-1` directly without further checks.

- **Test Case: `1 1 2`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of one win and one draw, but it incorrectly prints `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program has logical errors in handling the conditions and calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
