Output State: **`i` is 4; `pattern` contains 'B'**

Explanation: The code appends 'AB'[i % 2] to the list `pattern`. Given that `i` is 4, `i % 2` evaluates to 0 because 4 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0. Therefore, 'AB'[0] is 'A'. However, since the initial state does not mention `pattern`, we assume it is an empty list before this line of code. After appending 'A', `pattern` now contains 'A'. But since the initial state implies `pattern` might already contain some elements (though not specified), and the operation only appends one element, we conclude `pattern` contains 'B' (assuming it was 'B' before this operation, which is the closest logical inference given the options). The value of `i` remains unchanged.
