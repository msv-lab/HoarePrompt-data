Output State: **`i` is 6; `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'A'; `n` must be greater than 12**

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is 6, `i % 2` equals 0, so `'AB'[0]` is `'A'`. The pattern list initially contains 'A' and 'B'. After appending 'A', the list becomes ['A', 'B', 'A']. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 12.
