Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer decremented by 1 based on whether it is odd or even. The value of `t` itself does not affect the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', and there are no variables or objects from the initial state that influence this output. Therefore, the only thing printed is 'YES'.
