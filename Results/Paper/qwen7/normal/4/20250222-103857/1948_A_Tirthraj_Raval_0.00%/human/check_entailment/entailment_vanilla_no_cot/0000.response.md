Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to generate strings with exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even. The logic used to generate the pattern ('AB' or 'BA') does not ensure that the generated string will have exactly `n` special characters.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the pattern generation logic correctly places special characters as required. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Generate a pattern with exactly n special characters
            pattern = ['A'] * n
            for i in range(1, n, 2):
                pattern[i] = 'B'
            print(''.join(pattern))

func()
```

This revised solution ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters by alternating between 'A' and 'B' starting from the second position (index 1) and skipping every other position to place 'B'. This guarantees that the generated string will have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
