Output State: `i` is equal to `n // 2`; `pattern` is a list containing alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with a length of `n // 2`.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n // 2`. The `pattern` list will contain alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with a total length of `n // 2`.
