Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `pattern` is a list of 9 alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, `i` is 4**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `pattern`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 1, `pattern` remains a list of 9 alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, and `i` remains 4. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user.
