Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - For `x = 2`, the program prints `1` and `0` and returns immediately. This is correct because the only way to have exactly 2 increasing subsequences is to have an array with a single element `0`.

3. **Binary Representation**:
   - For other values of `x`, the program uses binary representation to construct the array. It calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and subtracts it from `x`, repeating this process until `x` becomes 0.
   - The `subseq_lens` list stores these powers minus one, which corresponds to the lengths of the segments of the array that need to be filled with unique values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first filling it with the range of values from `0` to `mx - 1` (where `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`).
   - Then, for each subsequent segment defined by `subseq_lens`, the program appends the appropriate length to `ansv`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array followed by the array itself. This matches the problem requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `x = 2` correctly.
   - For other values, the construction logic seems to be sound and should produce arrays that meet the criteria.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
