Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution should handle this by constructing an array where the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the binary representation of `X`. Specifically, if we represent `X` in binary, the number of increasing subsequences can be derived from the positions of the set bits in the binary representation.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `X`.
   - It then attempts to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2, which corresponds to finding the binary representation of `X`.
   - The length of the array is determined by the highest power of 2 used in the decomposition.
   - The array is constructed such that it has the required number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `X = 2`, the solution correctly prints `[0]` because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`.
   - For other values of `X`, the solution constructs an array using the binary representation of `X`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The solution handles the construction of the array correctly based on the binary representation of `X`.
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
