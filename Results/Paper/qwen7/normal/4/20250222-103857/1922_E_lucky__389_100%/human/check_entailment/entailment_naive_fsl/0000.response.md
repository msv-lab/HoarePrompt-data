Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where `X` is a prime number greater than 2. For such cases, the program incorrectly prints `-1`, indicating that no such array exists, which contradicts the problem statement that such an array should exist for any `X` in the given range.

For example, consider `X = 3`. According to the problem description, an array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0]`. However, the program would incorrectly output `-1` for this value of `X`.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where `X` is a prime number greater than 2 by constructing an appropriate array.
