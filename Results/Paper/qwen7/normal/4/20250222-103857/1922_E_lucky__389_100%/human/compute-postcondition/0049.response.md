The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition remains true after the current iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must still hold true. This means that `2 ** 4 <= x` must be true, which simplifies to `16 <= x`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be at least 16. No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `i` and `x`.

State: **`i` is 4 and `x` must be at least 16**
