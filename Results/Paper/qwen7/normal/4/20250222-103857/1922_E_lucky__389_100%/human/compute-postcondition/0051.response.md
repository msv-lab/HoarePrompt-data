Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 14.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`. Initially, `x` is 14. After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is 5 and `x` must be at least 16. We need to find out how many more times the loop will run until `2 ** i` exceeds `x`.

Starting from `i = 5`, we check:

- When `i = 5`, `2 ** 5 = 32`, which is greater than 14, so the loop stops.

Therefore, the loop runs a total of 5 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 4` initially, plus one more time when `i` becomes 5). Thus, `i` will be 10 after all iterations, and `x` remains unchanged at 14.
