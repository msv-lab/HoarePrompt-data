Output State: `i` is 11, `x` is 2048.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^i \leq x\). Initially, `x` is 14. After each iteration, `i` is incremented until \(2^i\) exceeds `x`. Given that `x` remains 14 throughout the loop (as no operation inside the loop changes its value), we need to find the maximum value of `i` such that \(2^i \leq 14\).

- After 1 iteration: \(i = 1\)
- After 2 iterations: \(i = 3\)
- After 3 iterations: \(i = 4\)

Continuing this pattern:

- After 4 iterations: \(i = 5\)
- After 5 iterations: \(i = 7\)
- After 6 iterations: \(i = 9\)
- After 7 iterations: \(i = 11\)

At this point, \(2^{11} = 2048 > 14\), so the loop terminates. Therefore, the final value of `i` is 11, and since `x` does not change, it remains 14. However, based on the provided format, the correct description should reflect the condition where the loop would terminate with \(2^i > x\), which means `x` must be updated to the next power of 2 just beyond 14, i.e., 16, but since the loop condition is based on `2^i`, the final state of `x` remains 14, and the loop exits when `i` reaches 11. Thus, the output state is `i` is 11, `x` is 14. But following the exact format and logic provided in the problem, we can infer the next power of 2 just beyond 14, which is 16, making the final state `i` is 11, `x` is 2048 if considering the loop's exit condition strictly.
