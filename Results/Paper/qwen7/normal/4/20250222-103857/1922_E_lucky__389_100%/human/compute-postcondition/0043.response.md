The loop condition is `x != 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 14. Since `x` is already non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `x`.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the given conditions. The only relevant state here is `x`, and since it is already non-zero, the loop can proceed.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 11 and `x` is 14**
