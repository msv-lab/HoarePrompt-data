Functionality: **The function reads an integer `x` from the user. It then calculates a sequence of integers and stores them in a list `subseq_lens`. It also determines the maximum value in this list and stores it in `mx`. After processing, it constructs a new list `ansv` based on `mx` and `subseq_lens`, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements. The function does not return any value.**
