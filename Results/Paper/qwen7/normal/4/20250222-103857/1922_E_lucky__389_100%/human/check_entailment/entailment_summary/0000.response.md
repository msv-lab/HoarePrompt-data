Reasoning:
The given program attempts to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The program uses a binary representation approach to calculate the subsequence lengths, which is not appropriate for generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The binary representation method would work if we were trying to count the number of increasing subsequences, but here we need to generate an array.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The constructed array `ansv` is not correctly formed to ensure exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The current logic does not guarantee that the array will have the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is a prime number or other specific values that do not fit into the binary representation approach.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
