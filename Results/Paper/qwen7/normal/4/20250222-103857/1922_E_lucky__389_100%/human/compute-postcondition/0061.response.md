Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], and `i` is 0.

Explanation: After the first three iterations, we know that `subseq_lens` has been updated with the values 5, 10, and 9, and `mx` has been updated to 10. Since `x` is reduced to 0 after each iteration and the loop condition `x != 0` is no longer satisfied, the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the values [5, 10, 9], `mx` will be 10, and `i` will be 0 as the inner while loop will exit when `2 ** i > x`.
