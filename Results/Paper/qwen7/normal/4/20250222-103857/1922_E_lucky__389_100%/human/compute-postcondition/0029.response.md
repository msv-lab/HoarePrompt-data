The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true at the start of the next iteration.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `mx` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `x` is 14 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 1

The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. Currently, `i` is 1, so `2 ** i` is `2 ** 1 = 2`. Since `2 <= 14` is true, the loop can execute one more time as long as `i` is incremented and the condition remains true.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, making `2 ** i` equal to `2 ** 2 = 4`, which is still less than or equal to `x` (14).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`i` must be 2**
