Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `len(subseq_lens)`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values `[5, 10, 9]`.
   - Therefore, `len(subseq_lens)` is 3.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < len(subseq_lens)`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be less than `len(subseq_lens)`, which is 3.
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so the loop can still execute as long as `i` is incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `len(subseq_lens)` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `subseq_lens`.

5. **List the Updated States:**
   - `mx` remains unchanged at 10.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `x` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `subseq_lens` remains unchanged at `[5, 10, 9]`.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `ansv` remains unchanged at `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]**
