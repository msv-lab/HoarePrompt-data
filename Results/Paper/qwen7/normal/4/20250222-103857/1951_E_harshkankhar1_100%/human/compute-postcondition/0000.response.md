Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The length of the string `s` is calculated and stored in the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being the length of the string `s` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) is preserved. The output state reflects these changes.
