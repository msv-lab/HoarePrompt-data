Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed execution.
- `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists).
- The loop has executed `n-1` times.
- The condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == True` holds true.
- The value of `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement will print the integer `2` regardless of the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

Output: **2**
