### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It works correctly for identifying palindromic strings.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it tries to find a character that differs from the first character at position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`).
     - If such a character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the remaining part is a palindrome.
       - If the remaining part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
       - If the split is at the middle of the string (i.e., `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`), it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is not a palindrome by printing "YES" and the string itself.
   - It correctly identifies the middle of the string and handles cases where the string is symmetric around the middle.
   - However, there are issues with the handling of certain edge cases:
     - The function fails to correctly identify and handle cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic parts.
     - The function incorrectly prints "NO" when the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic parts.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Consider the string `s = "abcde"`. The function should correctly identify that this string can be split into "abc" and "de" as both are non-palindromic.
   - However, the current implementation only checks for splitting at positions where the first character differs from the rest, which is insufficient for finding all possible partitions.
   - The function also incorrectly handles cases like `s = "abcdcba"`, where the string can be split into "abc" and "dcb" or "ab" and "cd" and "ba". The current implementation would fail to recognize these valid partitions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While the function correctly handles some basic cases, it fails to handle more complex scenarios where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic parts.
   - The function incorrectly prints "NO" in cases where a valid partition exists.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is not fully correct because it fails to handle all possible valid partitions of the string into non-palindromic substrings.
