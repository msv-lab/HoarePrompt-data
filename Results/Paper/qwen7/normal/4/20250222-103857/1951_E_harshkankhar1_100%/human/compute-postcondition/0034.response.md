Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists)
- The loop has executed `n-1` times
- The condition `x != -1` holds true
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
