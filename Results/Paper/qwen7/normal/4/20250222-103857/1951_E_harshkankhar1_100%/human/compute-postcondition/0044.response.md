Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed its execution.
- `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists). It is also specified that `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
- The condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == True` holds true, implying that the substring starting from index `x + 1` satisfies the condition specified by `func_1`.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
