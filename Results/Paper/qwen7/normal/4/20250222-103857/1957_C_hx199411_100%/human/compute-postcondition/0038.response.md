Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and `m` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
