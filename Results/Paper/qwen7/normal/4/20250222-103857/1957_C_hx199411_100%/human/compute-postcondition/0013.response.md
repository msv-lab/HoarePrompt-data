Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, and `r` are updated as follows: `t` remains `t - 2`, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `num` remains either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` remains 1, and `c` and `r` become the input integers.
