Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`**.

In this case, the code simply sets `num` to 0. Since `num` was previously defined as either `k` or `2 * k`, it now explicitly becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
