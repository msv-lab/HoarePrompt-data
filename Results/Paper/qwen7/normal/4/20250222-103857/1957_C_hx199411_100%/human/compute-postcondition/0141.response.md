Output State: **`i` is `k - 2`, `m` must be at least 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. After this operation, the value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k - 2`. The values of `m` and `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code.
