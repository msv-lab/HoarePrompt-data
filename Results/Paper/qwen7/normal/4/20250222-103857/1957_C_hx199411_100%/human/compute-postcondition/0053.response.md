Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`**.

The value of `t` is decreased by 1, while the values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
