Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is initially set to `k - 1`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs from `3` to `m + 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (`k - 1`) must be less than `3` for the loop to start executing.

Given the loop condition `for i in range(3, m + 1)`, the loop will start executing if `i >= 3`. Since `i` is initially set to `k - 1`, we need to ensure that `k - 1` is at least `3`.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is at least `3` for the loop to start executing. This means `k - 1` should be at least `3`, so `k` should be at least `4`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 4, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and `m` is not equal to 0**
