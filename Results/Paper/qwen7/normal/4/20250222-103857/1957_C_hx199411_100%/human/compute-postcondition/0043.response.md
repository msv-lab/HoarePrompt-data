Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `3` to `m + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[i] + i * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`

4. **Determine the new values for the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again. Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `dp[i + 1]` is already calculated and does not need adjustment.
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 2`.
   - `m` must remain such that it is greater than or equal to `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[i] + i * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `i` is `i + 2, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2**
