The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), two integers n and k (where n is the size of the board and k is the number of moves), and k pairs of integers (r, c) representing moves on the board. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid moves (where r equals c adds 1 to the count, otherwise adds 2) and computes a dynamic programming solution to determine the number of ways to achieve a specific configuration on the board. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of ways to achieve the configuration modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If no valid moves are left, it prints 1.
