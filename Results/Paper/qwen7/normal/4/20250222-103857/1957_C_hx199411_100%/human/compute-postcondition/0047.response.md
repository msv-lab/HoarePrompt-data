Based on the initial state described, the `dp` list is computed such that:

- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- For `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`

The final state of `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the specified initial values and computed values based on the given formula. The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`.

Given the initial conditions and the computation rule, the exact value of `dp[m]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `m`. However, we know that `dp[m]` is the result of the computation following the given formula.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element of the list dp, computed using the given formula starting from dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3)**
