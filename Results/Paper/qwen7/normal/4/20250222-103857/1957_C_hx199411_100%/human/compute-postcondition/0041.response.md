Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 3 to `m + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `m` is the upper limit of the loop.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be within the range `[3, m + 1)`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `dp[i]` is no longer needed because it is already calculated.
   - `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given that the current value of `i` is such that the loop just completed its previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[i] + i * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `i` is `i + 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1**.
