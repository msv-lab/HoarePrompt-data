Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes user input and splits it into two parts using space as a delimiter. Each part is then converted to an integer and assigned to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
