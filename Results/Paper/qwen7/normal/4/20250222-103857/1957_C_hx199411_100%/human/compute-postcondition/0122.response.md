Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the second input, `r` is an integer from the second input, and `num` is either 6 or 6 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not.**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Since `num` was either 3 or 4 before the operation, after adding 2, `num` becomes 5 or 6. However, the condition for `num` being 6 is the same as it being 5 (since both 3+2 and 4+2 result in 5 and 6 respectively), so `num` is either 6 or 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
