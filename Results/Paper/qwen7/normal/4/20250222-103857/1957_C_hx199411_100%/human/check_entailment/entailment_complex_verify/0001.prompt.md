You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    #State: Output State: `t` is `0`, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the last input, and `m` is `n - num`. The variable `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is calculated according to the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), starting with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and finally, the output is `dp[m]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be `0` since it starts at the initial value of `int(input())` and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The final values of `n` and `k` will be those provided in the last input. The variable `num` will hold the cumulative count based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `m` will be the result of `n - num`. The list `dp` will contain the computed values following the given recurrence relation, and the final printed output will be `dp[m]`, which is the last computed value in the list `dp`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), two integers n and k (where n is the size of the board and k is the number of moves), and k pairs of integers (r, c) representing moves on the board. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid moves (where r equals c adds 1 to the count, otherwise adds 2) and computes a dynamic programming solution to determine the number of ways to achieve a specific configuration on the board. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of ways to achieve the configuration modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If no valid moves are left, it prints 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard with alternating moves between the player and the computer.
   - The player starts first, and the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is along the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the coordinates of the \( k \) moves.
   - It calculates `num` which counts how many moves were along the diagonal (where the computer cannot mirror).
   - It then calculates `m` as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of non-diagonal positions left to place rooks.
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation:**
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store the number of ways to place rooks in up to `m` positions.
   - Base cases are set for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` ensures that the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions is calculated correctly, considering the constraints of no attacking rooks.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m` is 0 or 1, the code handles these edge cases correctly by printing 1.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code logic aligns with the problem statement and the example provided.
   - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of valid configurations.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.
