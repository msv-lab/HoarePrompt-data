Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the moves.

2. **Calculating the Number of Remaining Valid Positions:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that cannot be used due to the moves already made.
   - If `c == r`, it means the move is mirrored, so only one position is invalid (`num += 1`).
   - Otherwise, two positions are invalid (`num += 2`).

3. **Calculating the Number of Remaining Valid Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining valid positions.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the program directly prints `1` because there are no valid positions or only one valid position left, respectively.

5. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid positions.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints `dp[m]`, which gives the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification:

- The logic for counting invalid positions and calculating the remaining valid positions seems correct.
- The dynamic programming approach correctly handles the combinatorial aspect of placing rooks in the remaining valid positions.
- The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
