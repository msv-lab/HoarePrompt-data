Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2, starting from its initial value of 0. Therefore, `num` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
