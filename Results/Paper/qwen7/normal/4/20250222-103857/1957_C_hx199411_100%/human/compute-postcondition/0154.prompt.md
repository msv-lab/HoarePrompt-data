You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is `0`, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the last input, and `m` is `n - num`. The variable `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is calculated according to the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), starting with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and finally, the output is `dp[m]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be `0` since it starts at the initial value of `int(input())` and is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The final values of `n` and `k` will be those provided in the last input. The variable `num` will hold the cumulative count based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `m` will be the result of `n - num`. The list `dp` will contain the computed values following the given recurrence relation, and the final printed output will be `dp[m]`, which is the last computed value in the list `dp`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and for each test case, pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions provided, including error messages for invalid inputs and results based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
