Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with zeros except `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is an input integer from one of the inputs, `r` is an input integer from the same input as `c`, `num` is the final value calculated based on all the comparisons made during the loop, which is `2*k + (k - 1)` if all `c` equals `r` or `2*k + 2*(k - 1)` if any `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`.**

This means that the list `dp` now has `dp[1]` set to 1 and `dp[2]` set to 3, while all other elements remain zero. The other variables retain their initial conditions as described.
