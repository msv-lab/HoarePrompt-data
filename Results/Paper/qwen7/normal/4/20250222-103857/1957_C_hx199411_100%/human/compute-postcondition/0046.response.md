Output State: The value of `dp[i]` will be computed for all indices from 3 to `m` inclusive, following the rule `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The variable `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m + 1`. After all iterations, the list `dp` will contain `m + 1` elements, where `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and each subsequent element `dp[i]` for `i >= 3` is calculated based on the given formula, ensuring no overflow by taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The final state of `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` with the first two elements fixed as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and the rest of the elements filled according to the loop's computation rule.
