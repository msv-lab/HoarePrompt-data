Output State: **Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is an empty list, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `nums`, or `numbers`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
