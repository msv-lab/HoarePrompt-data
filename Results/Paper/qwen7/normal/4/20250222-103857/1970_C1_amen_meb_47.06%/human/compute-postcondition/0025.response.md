Output State: The list `numbers` contains all the pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` entered as input until the condition `len(nums) != 2` is met, which causes the loop to break. `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state, with no changes during the loop executions.

In simpler terms, the final output state will have `numbers` as a list containing all the pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were entered as input, until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
