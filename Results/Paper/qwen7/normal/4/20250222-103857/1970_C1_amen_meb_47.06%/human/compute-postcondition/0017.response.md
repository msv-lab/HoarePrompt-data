Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.append([num1, num2])` appends the list `[num1, num2]` to the existing list `numbers`. Since `num1` and `num2` are already defined as the first and second elements of `nums`, respectively, appending this list does not change the values of `num1` and `num2`. All other variables remain unchanged as well.
