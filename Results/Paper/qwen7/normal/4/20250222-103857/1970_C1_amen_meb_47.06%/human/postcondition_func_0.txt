The function processes input pairs of integers [num1, num2] until the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. It retains the initial values of n, t, u, and v: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The function returns a list numbers containing all processed pairs of integers.
