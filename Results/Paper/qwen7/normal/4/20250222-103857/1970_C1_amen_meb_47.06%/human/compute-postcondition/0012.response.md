Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `num1` is an integer, `num2` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `nums`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the structure of `nums` (with `num1` and `num2` being the first and second elements respectively) remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated list `nums` which now contains two elements, `num1` and `num2`, both of which are integers.
