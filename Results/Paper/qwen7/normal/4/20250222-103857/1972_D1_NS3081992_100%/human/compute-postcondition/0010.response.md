Output State: **`ans` is the value of ans plus (n + 2) // (2 * 2) plus (n + 3) // (3 * 3), `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`. The initial state also includes that `ans` was previously updated by `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `n` must be at least 6, the updated `ans` will include both contributions. The values of `i` and `n`'s constraint remain unchanged, and `m`'s constraint is still valid.
