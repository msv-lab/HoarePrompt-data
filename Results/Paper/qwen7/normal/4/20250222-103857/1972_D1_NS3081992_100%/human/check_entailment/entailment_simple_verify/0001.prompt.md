You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis
The provided code contains several functions, but most of them are not used in solving the problem. We need to focus on the relevant parts:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_10()` reads an integer from stdin.
   - `func_7()` reads a line of space-separated integers.
   - `func_15()` seems to be the main function that calculates the number of valid pairs.

2. **Main Function (`func_15`):**
   ```python
   def func_15():
       (n, m) = func_7()
       i = 1
       ans = 0
       while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
           ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
           i += 1
       return ans - 1
   ```

### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`
- It reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input using `func_7()`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) (inclusive), stopping when \(i^2 > n + i\).
- For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic:
- The expression \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) counts how many multiples of \(i^2\) fit into \(n + i\).
- This approach does not directly solve the problem as stated. Instead, it appears to be a heuristic or approximation method rather than a direct solution.

### Example Verification
Let's manually check the output for a few test cases to see if the function works as expected:

#### Test Case 1: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\)
- Expected output: 1
- Actual output: 1

#### Test Case 2: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- Expected output: 3
- Actual output: 3

#### Test Case 3: \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\)
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\)
- Expected output: 4
- Actual output: 4

#### Test Case 4: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\), \((10, 3)\)
- Expected output: 14
- Actual output: 14

### Conclusion
Based on the manual verification, the function `func_15` seems to produce the correct results for the given examples. However, without a rigorous mathematical proof, we cannot guarantee its correctness for all possible inputs.

Given the problem constraints and the observed outputs, we can conclude that the function is likely correct for the given test cases.
