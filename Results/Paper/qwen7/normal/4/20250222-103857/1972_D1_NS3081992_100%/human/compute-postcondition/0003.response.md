Output State: **`sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The value returned by `func_15()` is a specific value greater than 0, as `func_15()` returns a value greater than 0 and this is the only change made to the state.**

In this output state, the value returned by `func_15()` (which is greater than 0) is written to the standard output followed by a newline. The initial conditions regarding `func_10()` returning a value greater than 0 remain unchanged.
