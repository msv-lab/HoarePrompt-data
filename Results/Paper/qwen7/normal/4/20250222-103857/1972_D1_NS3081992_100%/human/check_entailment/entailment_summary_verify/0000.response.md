Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - **Function 16**: This function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calls `func_15()` for each test case to determine the number of valid pairs and writes these values to standard output, followed by a newline. The total number of test cases is determined by `func_10()`, which returns an integer between 1 and \( 10^4 \). The sum of \( n \) and \( m \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \).

3. **Function 15**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \( n \) and \( m \). The provided implementation in `func_15` is:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - This function iterates through possible values of \( i \) from 1 up to \( m \) and checks if \( i^2 \) divides \( n + i \). If it does, it increments the count of valid pairs. This logic seems to be incorrect because it does not consider the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

4. **Utility Functions**:
   - The utility functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., are used for reading input from stdin. They do not contribute to solving the problem directly but are necessary for handling input.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The provided implementation in `func_15` only checks if \( i^2 \) divides \( n + i \), which is not the correct condition. Therefore, the program as a whole does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
