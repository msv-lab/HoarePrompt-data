Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` and the logic within it do not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_15` attempts to count pairs by iterating through values of \(i\) up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\), but this approach does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Missing Key Steps**: The solution needs to consider the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) more carefully. Specifically, for each \(b\), we need to find all possible \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves checking the gcd and ensuring the condition holds.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\). For each pair \((a, b)\), check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = func_10()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = func_2()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, which ensures correctness according to the problem statement.
