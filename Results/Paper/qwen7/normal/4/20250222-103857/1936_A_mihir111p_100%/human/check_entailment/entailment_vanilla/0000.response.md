Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding `ans1`:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and calls `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`.
   - If the result of `func_1` is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`.

3. **Finding `mx` and `v`:**
   - `mx` is initialized to 0.
   - `v` is initialized as a list containing only 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and calls `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`.
   - If the result of `func_1` is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and updates `mx` to `i` and adds `i` to `v`.
   - If the result is `=`, it simply adds `i` to `v`.

4. **Selecting the Maximum Value from `v`:**
   - `mx` is set to the first element of `v`.
   - `ans` is also set to the first element of `v`.
   - It iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and calls `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])`.
   - If the result of `func_1` is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Query Generation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the same index twice (`a, b, c, d`), which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires comparing different indices to determine the bitwise OR results.

2. **Logic Flaw in Finding `ans1`:**
   - The logic for finding `ans1` is flawed. It compares the same index with itself, which doesn't provide meaningful information about the permutation.

3. **Logic Flaw in Finding `mx` and `v`:**
   - The logic for finding `mx` and `v` is also flawed. It compares the same index with `ans1` twice, which again doesn't provide meaningful information.

4. **Incorrect Final Selection:**
   - The final selection of `ans` and `ans1` is based on comparing the same index with itself, which is not useful for determining the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized using the allowed queries.

**Correctness: **False**
