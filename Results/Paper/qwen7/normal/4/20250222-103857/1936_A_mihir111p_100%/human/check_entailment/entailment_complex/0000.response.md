Reasoning:
1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**: The program iterates through the test cases. For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0 and then iterates from 1 to `n-1`. In the loop, it calls `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` to compare `(p_ans1 | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. This step seems to be unnecessary since both sides are identical and will always return `=`. However, the logic here is not clear without understanding the purpose of `ans1`.

2. **Finding Maximum OR Value (`mx`)**: The variable `mx` is initialized to 0, and an empty list `v` is created. Then, it iterates from 1 to `n-1`, comparing `(p_mx | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_ans1)`. If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and sets `mx` to `i`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`. This step aims to find the index `i` that gives the maximum OR value when compared with `ans1`.

3. **Selecting Maximum Index (`ans`)**: After identifying potential candidates in `v`, it selects the first candidate as `mx` and then iterates through the rest of the candidates to find the one that gives the maximum XOR value with `ans`.

4. **Query and Output**: Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

5. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly performs the query and returns the result. However, the logic inside the main program relies on the results of these queries to determine the final answer.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program attempts to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.
   - The logic for finding the maximum OR value (`mx`) is flawed because it only considers comparisons with `ans1` and does not consider the actual values of `p_i`.
   - The selection of the final answer (`ans`) is based on the maximum XOR value, but the process of finding `mx` is incorrect.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.

Correctness: **False**
