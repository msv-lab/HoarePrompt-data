Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the maximum XOR value using a series of OR operations and comparisons, but it does not properly handle the query and comparison process as described in the problem statement.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Query Function Call**: The program calls `func_1` with the same index twice (`a, b, c, d`), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The function should take four distinct indices.

2. **Query Logic**: The program's logic for determining the maximum XOR value is flawed. It does not correctly use the results of the OR operations to compare and update the maximum XOR value.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the answer in the format `! i j`, but it does not correctly compute the values of `i` and `j` that maximize the XOR value.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct. A correct implementation would need to properly handle the queries and comparisons as specified in the problem description.
