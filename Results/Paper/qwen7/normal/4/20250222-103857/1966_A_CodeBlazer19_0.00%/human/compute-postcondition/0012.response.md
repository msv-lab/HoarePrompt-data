Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space, and a list `l` is created by taking the input string, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer.**

In this case, the code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are updated accordingly.
