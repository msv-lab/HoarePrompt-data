Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

The `print(k - 1)` statement will subtract 1 from the value of `k` and print the result.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1**
