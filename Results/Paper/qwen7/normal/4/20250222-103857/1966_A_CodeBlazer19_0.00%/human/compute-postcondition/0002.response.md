Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
