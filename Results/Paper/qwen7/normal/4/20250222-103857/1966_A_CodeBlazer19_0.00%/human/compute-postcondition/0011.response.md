Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.
