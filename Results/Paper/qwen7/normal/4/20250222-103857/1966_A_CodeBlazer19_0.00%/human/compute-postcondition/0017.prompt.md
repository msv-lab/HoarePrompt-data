You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `t-1`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` will be an integer ranging from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop completes, `n` and `k` will have the values from the last input split by space, and `l` will be the list of integers obtained from splitting the last input string and converting each element to an integer. All other variables outside the loop remain unchanged.
    #
    #In summary, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the last input string split by spaces and converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and then a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
