Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only prints `k - 1` for every test case, which is not correct. The program should count the occurrences of each unique number on the cards and then calculate the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k`. The current implementation does not account for this logic.
