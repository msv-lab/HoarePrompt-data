Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards left after performing the specified operations. However, the program does not account for this requirement; it always outputs `k - 1`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cards that can be left.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should group the cards by their numbers, count how many groups of `k` or more cards exist, and then calculate the minimum number of cards left based on these groups. The program should also handle cases where fewer than `k` cards of a particular number are present.

Correctness: **False**
