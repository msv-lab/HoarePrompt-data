Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `l` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, splitting the input string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
