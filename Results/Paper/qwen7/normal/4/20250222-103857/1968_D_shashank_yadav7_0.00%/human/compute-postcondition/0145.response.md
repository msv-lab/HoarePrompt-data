Output State: **`i` is 9, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to it. Since the values of `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp` are not specified, we keep them in their general form. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
