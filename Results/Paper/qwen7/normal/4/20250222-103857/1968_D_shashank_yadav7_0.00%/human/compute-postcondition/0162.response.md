Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i = 14`
   - `k = -3`
   - `b` is defined as `p[b] - 3`. Since `b` itself is used in this definition, it forms a circular reference. However, without knowing the value of `p`, we cannot determine the exact value of `b`.
   - `s` is defined as `p[s] - 3`. Similarly, `s` itself is used in this definition, forming another circular reference. Without knowing the value of `p`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`.
   - `bm` is defined as `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. This is a recursive definition where `bm` depends on itself and other variables.
   - `sm` is defined as `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This is also a recursive definition where `sm` depends on itself and other variables.
   - `sp` is defined as `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[s] + sp`.
   - `bp` is defined as `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b] + bp`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Bodya')`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the print statement will simply output the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the other variables because the print statement does not depend on any of those variables.

Output: **Bodya**
