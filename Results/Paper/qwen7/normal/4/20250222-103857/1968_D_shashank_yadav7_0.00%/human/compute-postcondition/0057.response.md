Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is adjusted based on the list `p`, `sp` has been incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` has been incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`, and the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0. If `bm > sm` is true, then `bm` remains the same as the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`. If `bm <= sm`, then `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, and `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`.**
