Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `i` is 0, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is -1, the expression `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `-a[s] + sp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
