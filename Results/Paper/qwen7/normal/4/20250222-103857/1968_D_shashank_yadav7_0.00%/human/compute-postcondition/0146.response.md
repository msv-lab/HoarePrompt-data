Output State: **`i` is 9, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Given that `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1 - 1`, the updated value of `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s] + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
