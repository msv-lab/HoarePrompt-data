Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The value of `k` is decreased by 1, but since `k` was not defined before, we cannot specify its exact value now, only that it has been decreased by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains valid.
