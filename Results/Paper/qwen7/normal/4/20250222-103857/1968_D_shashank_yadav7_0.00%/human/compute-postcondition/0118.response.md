Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is at least as large as `sm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to an integer type, storing them in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
