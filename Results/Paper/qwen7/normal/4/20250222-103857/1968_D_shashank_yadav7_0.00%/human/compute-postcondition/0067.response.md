Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `input integer - 2`, `sp` is the value of `a[2]`, `bp` is `a[input integer - 2]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be `a[s] * k`. Given that `s` is 2, `sm` becomes `a[2] * -2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
