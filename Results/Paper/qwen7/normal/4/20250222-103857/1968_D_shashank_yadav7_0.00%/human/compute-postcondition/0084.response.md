Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. The initial value of `b` is `p[b] - 1`, so after the assignment, `b` becomes `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
