Output State: `i` is 12, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 3`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b] + a[b]`.

This means after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be 12 (since it starts at 8 and increments by 1 each iteration), `k` will be -3 (as it starts at -3 and decreases by 1 each iteration). The variables `b` and `s` will be updated based on the input list `p`, with `b` being updated three times and `s` being updated twice. The `bm` and `sm` variables will accumulate their respective values as described, while `sp` and `bp` will also be updated according to the operations performed within the loop.
