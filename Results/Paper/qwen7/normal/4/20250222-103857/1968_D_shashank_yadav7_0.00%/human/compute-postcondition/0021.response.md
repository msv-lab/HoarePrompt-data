Output State: **`sm` is `sm` + max(`sm`, `a[s]` * `k` + `sp`), `i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` equals 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding to it the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. Since `k` is 0, `a[s] * k` becomes 0, simplifying the expression to `max(sm, sp + a[s])`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged.
