Output State: **`sm` is `sm` + max(`sm`, `a[s]` * `k` + `sp`), `i` is 0, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
