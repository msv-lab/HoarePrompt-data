Output State: **`i` is 9, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp**.

Explanation: The code `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates the value of `bm`. Initially, `bm` is set to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. After this line, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, which simplifies to `2 * bm` because the first term `bm` is already included in the `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` function. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
