Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is -2, `sp` is the element at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is the element at index `b` in list `a` multiplied by `k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to the variable `sm`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `sp`, `bp`, and `bm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
