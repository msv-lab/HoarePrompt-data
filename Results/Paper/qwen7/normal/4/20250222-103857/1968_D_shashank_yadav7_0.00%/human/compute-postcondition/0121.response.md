Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `s - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `bm` is at least as large as `sm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `sp = a[s]` assigns the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
