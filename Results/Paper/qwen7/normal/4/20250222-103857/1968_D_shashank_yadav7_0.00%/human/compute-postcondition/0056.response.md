Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `s` is adjusted based on the list `p`, `sp` has been incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` has been incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, `sm` has been incremented by the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`. The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, and the condition that `bm` is not greater than `sm` holds true if `bm < sm`; otherwise, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.**
