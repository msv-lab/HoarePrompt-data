Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp`, `n` must be greater than 10**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `-1` to `-2`. The other variables (`i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state and the code snippet.
