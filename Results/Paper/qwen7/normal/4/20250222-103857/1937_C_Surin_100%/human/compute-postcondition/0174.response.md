Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`
   - `n`

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Initial values before the loop**:
   - `r` is an input string (not needed for the loop to execute)
   - `prev` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `v2` is `n-1`
   - `v1` is 0
   - `g` is 0
   - `kp` is 1

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range of the loop, which means `i` should be between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive).
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `n-1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is already at the upper bound of the loop range.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to change `i` to a value that is less than `n` to ensure the loop starts executing.
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, we need to decrement `i` to 1 or any value less than `n`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to 1 and ensure `n` remains as it is (since `n` is used to define the range).

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**
