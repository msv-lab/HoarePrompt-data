Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `2`, `n` must be greater than `2`, `v2` is `2`, `v1` is `1`, `g` is `0`, `r` is an input string**.

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. Since no specific value is provided for the input, `r` is represented as an input string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
