Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `v2` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `r` is an input string from the user (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Based on the above condition, we need to update `i` to 3 (since `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration) and ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2

Since `v2` and `r` are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
