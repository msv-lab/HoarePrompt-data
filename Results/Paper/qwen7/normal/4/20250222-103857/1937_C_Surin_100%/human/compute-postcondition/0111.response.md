Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prev` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `n` must be greater than `2`
   - `v2` is `2`
   - `v1` is `2`
   - `g` is `0`
   - `r` is an input string, and if `r` is equal to `<`, then `v1` and `v2` are both set to `2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `3` if the loop continues.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `3`, `n` must be greater than `3` for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only variables that change within the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to update these values.

7. **Consider the additional conditions**: The values of `v1`, `v2`, `g`, and `r` do not change based on the loop itself but might be influenced by external conditions. However, since no specific changes are mentioned for these variables within the loop, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly changed by the loop body, which is omitted here.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be `3`
- `n` must be greater than `3`

The other variables (`prev`, `v1`, `v2`, `g`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `3`, `n` must be greater than `3`, `v2` is `2`, `v1` is `2`, `g` is `0`, `r` is an input string**
