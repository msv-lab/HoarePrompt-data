Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the positive integer input by the user, `v2` is `n-1`, and `r` is an input string from the user. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is also equal to `n-1`.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `n-1`. The variable `v2` holds the value of `i` after the last iteration, which is `n-1`. The variable `v1` will be equal to `v2` (and thus `n-1`) if the user inputted '<' during any iteration where `r` was checked, otherwise `v1` remains 0.
