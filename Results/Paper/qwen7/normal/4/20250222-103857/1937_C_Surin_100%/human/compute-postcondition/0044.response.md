Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as `n-1`.
- `n` must be at least 2, so `i` will be at least 1.
- `v2` is explicitly given as `n-1`.
- `r` is the new input string from the user, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The current value of `r` is explicitly given as '='.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Given the values:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] 0 0**
