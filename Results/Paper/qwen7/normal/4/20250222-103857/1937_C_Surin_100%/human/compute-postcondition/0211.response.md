Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.
- `r` is an input string with the current value being '='.
- `r` is not equal to '>'.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:
- `{i}` will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 1.
- `{i}` again will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 1.
- `{prev}` will be replaced by the value of `prev`, which is 0.
- `{prev}` again will be replaced by the value of `prev`, which is 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
