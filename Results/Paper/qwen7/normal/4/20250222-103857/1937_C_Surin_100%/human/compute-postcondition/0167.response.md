Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `g` is 0.**

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `prev` will be `n-1`, `i` will be `n-1`, and `n` will still be greater than `n-1` (which is essentially `n > n-1` always being true). The values of `v2` and `v1` remain `n-1`, and `g` remains 0, as these variables are not affected by the loop.
