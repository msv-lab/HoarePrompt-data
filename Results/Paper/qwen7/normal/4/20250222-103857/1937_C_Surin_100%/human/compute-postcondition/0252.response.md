Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `prev` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the user inputs during the loop iterations.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

Given the values of the variables:
- `prev` can be either `n-1` or `n-2`
- `v1` is `n-1`

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `prev` and `v1` as described above.

Output: **! [prev] [n-1]** (where `prev` is either `n-1` or `n-2` and `v1` is `n-1`)
