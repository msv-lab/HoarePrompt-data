Output State: **`r` is '=', and no changes were made to any variables.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console. However, since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the value of `r` remains unchanged.
