Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `r2` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r2`. The other variables (`i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev`) remain unchanged. The value of `n` is not specified, so `v2` and `v1` are still expressed as `n-1`. The state of `r` remains as an input string from the user, but now `r2` is also an input string from the user.
