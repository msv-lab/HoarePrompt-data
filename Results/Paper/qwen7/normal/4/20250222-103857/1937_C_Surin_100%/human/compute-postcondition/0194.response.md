Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `i`, `v2`, and `v1`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
