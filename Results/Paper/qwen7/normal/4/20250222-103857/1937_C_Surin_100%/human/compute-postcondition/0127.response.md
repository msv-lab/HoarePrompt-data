Output State: **`r` is '>' and `prev` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `prev` is assigned the value of `i`, which is an unspecified integer. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it was initially set to '>'.
