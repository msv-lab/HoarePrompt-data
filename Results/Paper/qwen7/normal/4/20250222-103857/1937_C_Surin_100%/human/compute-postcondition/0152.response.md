Postcondition: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is either `i` or `i+1`, `i` is either `i` or `i+1`, and `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` is `i+1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes after executing the if-else block. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `i`, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than `i+1`. If `r` is '=', `prev` is set to `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i+1`. In both cases, `r` becomes the new input string.
