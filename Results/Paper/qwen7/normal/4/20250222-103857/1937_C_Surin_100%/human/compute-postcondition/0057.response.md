Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is `n-1`
- `i` is `1`
- `n` must be at least 2
- `v2` is `n-1`

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, we know the values of `i` and `prev`:
- `i` is `1`
- `prev` is `n-1`

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with these known values. Since `v1` is not specified, it will remain as `v1` in the output string.

Output: **? v1 1 v1 n-1**
