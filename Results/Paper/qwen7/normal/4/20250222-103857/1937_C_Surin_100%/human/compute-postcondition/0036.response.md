Output State: **`prev` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string from the user, `r` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the new input string from the user to the variable `r`. The values of the other variables (`prev`, `i`, `n`, `v2`) remain unchanged.
