Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is 2, and if `r` is equal to '<', `v1` is 1. If `r` is not '<', the postcondition remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `v2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The conditions related to `r` and `v1` remain the same as the initial state since no code has altered those conditions.
