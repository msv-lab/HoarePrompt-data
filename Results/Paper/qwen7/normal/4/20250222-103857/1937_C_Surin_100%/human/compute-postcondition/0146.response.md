Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If `r` equals '>', then `prev` is an input integer.
   - If `r` equals '=', then `r2` is the input string from the user.
   - If `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is set to `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` must be greater than `i+1`, and `r` is now the new input string.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `i`, `prev`, and `r` to understand what will be printed.

- Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `r`, let's consider the conditions:
  - If `r` is '>', then `prev` would be an input integer.
  - If `r` is '=', then `r2` would be an input string, and if `r2` is '<', then `prev` would be set to `i+1`, and `i` would be incremented. However, without knowing the exact value of `i` or `n`, we cannot determine these values precisely.

Since the exact values of `i` and `prev` are not specified in the initial state, and the conditions provided do not give us enough information to determine their values, we can only describe them in terms of the conditions given.

Therefore, the output will depend on the input values for `i` and `prev` after the conditions are met. Given the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **'? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]'**
