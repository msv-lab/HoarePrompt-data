Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `r` equals '='.
   - `r` is an input string not equal to '>'.
   - `r2` is '<' if `r` equals '='.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `v2` and `v1` are derived from `n`, so they will be updated to `n-1` for the next iteration.
   - `prev` remains the same unless `r` changes, but since `r` is not specified to change, `prev` stays the same.
   - `r2` is '<' if `r` equals '=', and since `r` is not specified to change, `r2` remains '<'.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `v2` will be `n-1`.
   - `v1` will be `n-1`.
   - `prev` will be either 0 or 1.
   - `r2` will be '<'.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `r` equals '=', and `r2` is '<'.**
