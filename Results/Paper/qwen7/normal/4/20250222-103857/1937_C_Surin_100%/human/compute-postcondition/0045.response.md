Output State: **`prev` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string from the user, `r` is not equal to '>', and the current value of `r` is equal to '=', `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any variable values but ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
