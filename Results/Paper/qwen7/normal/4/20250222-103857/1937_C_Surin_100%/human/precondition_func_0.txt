None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires the function to interact with an external entity to perform queries and determine the maximum XOR value of any two indices in a hidden permutation. The function must handle up to 3n queries, where n is the size of the permutation, and n ranges from 2 to 10^4.
