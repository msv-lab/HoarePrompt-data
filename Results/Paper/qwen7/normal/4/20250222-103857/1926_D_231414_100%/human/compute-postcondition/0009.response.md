Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a non-empty list of integers, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `s` is `i` XOR `check`**.

Explanation: The code `s = i ^ check` assigns the value of `i` XOR `check` to `s`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. We know that `i` is not defined, and `check` is a constant value of 2147483647. Therefore, `s` is the result of `i` XOR 2147483647. The other variables remain unchanged.
