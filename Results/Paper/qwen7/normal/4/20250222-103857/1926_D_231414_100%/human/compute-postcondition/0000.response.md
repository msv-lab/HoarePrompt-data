Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
