Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` was initially 0 and now is incremented to 1, `y` becomes `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
