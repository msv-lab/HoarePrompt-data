Postcondition: `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` will remain as the initial value provided, `a` will remain as the sorted list of integers, `k` will either be 0 or will have been reduced according to the loop conditions, `r` will be set to `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k != 0`, otherwise `r` will be set to `a[n-1]`, `rem` will be 0, and `y` will be 0.
