Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` will remain as the initial value provided, `a` will remain as the sorted list of integers, `k` will either be 0 or will have been reduced according to the loop conditions, `r` will be set to `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k != 0`, otherwise `r` will be set to `a[n-1]`, `rem` will be 0, and `y` will be 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is either reduced to 0 or left with a non-negative value that cannot be further reduced by the loop, `r` holds the final value determined during the last iteration where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was either true or false, `rem` is 0 because it is set to `k % (i + 1)` when `k` is reduced, `y` is 0 because it is set to `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i` in the last iteration and then does not change, `ii` is equal to the number of iterations performed, `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, and the overall postcondition covers both cases where `k` is not 0 and where `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rem` is either `k % (n - 1)` or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or fully reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations, `r` is either `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)` or `a[n - 1]` depending on whether the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met for some `i`, and `y` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
