You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `ii` is equal to the total number of test cases provided. After all iterations, the variable `n` will be 0 since it is decremented or remains 0 after the loop's conditions are met. The variable `k` will be 0 because it is fully reduced by the loop's operations. The variable `r` will hold the final result calculated based on the last iteration's conditions, which could be `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, or simply `a[n - 1]` if `k` is 0. The variable `rem` will be 0 since it is set to `k % (i + 1)` when `k` is reduced to 0. The variable `y` will be 0 because it is only set during the loop and does not change afterward. The list `a` remains sorted and unchanged unless modified within the loop, and the overall postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the loop's execution.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `ii` equals the total number of test cases, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `r` is the final calculated result, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `a` remains sorted.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the list \( a \) and calculates a final value \( r \) based on the values in \( a \) and the integer \( k \). It then prints the result of the calculation, which depends on whether \( k \) is zero or not. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` after buying up to `k` additional cards.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the initial count of each card type.
   - It sorts the counts of the cards.
   - It iterates through the sorted counts to determine the highest card value `r` that can be achieved with the available `k` coins.
   - If the remaining coins `k` are not enough to increase the count of any card type beyond the current highest (`r`), it calculates the final value of `r` and the number of additional cards needed.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum score based on the calculated `r`.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - Sorting the counts is a good approach to find the minimum increments needed.
   - The logic to calculate `r` and the remaining coins `rem` seems to handle the case where `k` is not sufficient to increase all card counts equally.
   - The formula for calculating the maximum score `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` appears to correctly account for the number of valid subarrays.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `k` is zero or insufficient to change the highest card count.
   - It correctly calculates the number of valid subarrays based on the final card counts.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the score based on the given constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
