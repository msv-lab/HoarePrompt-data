Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is either reduced to 0 or left with a non-negative value that cannot be further reduced by the loop, `r` holds the final value determined during the last iteration where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was either true or false, `rem` is 0 because it is set to `k % (i + 1)` when `k` is reduced, `y` is 0 because it is set to `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i` in the last iteration and then does not change, `ii` is equal to the number of iterations performed, and `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, but since no such modifications are specified, they retain their initial values.
