Output State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by \(((i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1]))\) if \((i + 1) * (a[i + 2] - a[i + 1]) > k\) is false, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `r` is \(a[i] + k // (i + 1)\), `rem` is \(k \% (i + 1)\), `y` is \(n - 2 - i\)**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `rem` to be the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `rem` is now updated to \(k \% (i + 1)\), while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
