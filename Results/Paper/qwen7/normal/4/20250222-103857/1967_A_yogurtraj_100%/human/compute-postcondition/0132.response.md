Output State: **`rem` is either `k % 3` or 0, `i` is either 2 or 4, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), n` is `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1, and `r` is either `a[1]` or `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` subtracts the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`. Since `i` is either 2 or 4, the value of `k` is reduced accordingly. The other variables (`rem`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
