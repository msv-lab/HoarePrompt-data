Output State: **`rem` is k % 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `y` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The other variables (`rem`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
