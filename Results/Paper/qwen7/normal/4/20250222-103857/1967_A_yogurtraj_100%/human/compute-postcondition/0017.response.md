Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is updated based on whether the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true or false. If the condition is true, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
