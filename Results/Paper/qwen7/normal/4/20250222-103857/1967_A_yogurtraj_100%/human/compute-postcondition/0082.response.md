Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i`**

Explanation: The code `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated value of `r` is `a[i + 1]`, while `i`, `a`, `k`, `rem`, and `y` retain their original values.
