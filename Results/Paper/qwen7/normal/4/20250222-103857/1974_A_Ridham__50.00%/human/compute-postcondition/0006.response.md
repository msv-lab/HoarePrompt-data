Output State: **`total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_space` by adding `space_y` and `space_x`. Given that `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is set to `x + y * 4`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
