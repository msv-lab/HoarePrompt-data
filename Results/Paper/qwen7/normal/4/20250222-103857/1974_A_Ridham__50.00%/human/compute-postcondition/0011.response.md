Output State: **`total_space` is `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2 + 1`. Since `y` is an odd number, `y // 2` will be the integer division of `y` by 2, which means it discards the remainder. Adding 1 to this result gives us the final value of `screen_require_for_y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
