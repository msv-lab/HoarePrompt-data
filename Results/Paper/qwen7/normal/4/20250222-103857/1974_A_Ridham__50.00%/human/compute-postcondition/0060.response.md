Output State: **`remaining_cells`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen` remain as defined in the precondition; `result` contains an additional element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `result` the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. The values of `extra_screen` are determined based on the condition `if space_x % 15 == 0, then extra_screen = x // 15. Otherwise, extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`. However, since the exact values of `space_x`, `extra_space`, and other variables are not specified, we only know that `result` now includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
