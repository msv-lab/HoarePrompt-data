You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

For each iteration, `space_x` is set to `x * 1` and `space_y` is set to `y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y` is added to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is added to `result`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise. The final state of `t`, `n`, `total_space`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space` remains as defined in the precondition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This correctly calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This correctly calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).

3. **Total Space Calculation:**
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x`: This sums up the total space required for all icons.

4. **Calculating Minimum Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons when the count is even.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons when the count is odd.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.

6. **Checking if Remaining Cells Can Fit 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit within the remaining cells, so the total number of screens needed is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`: This calculates the number of additional cells needed.
     - `if space_x % 15 == 0: extra_screen = space_x // 15`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed if the remaining cells are exactly divisible by 15.
     - `else: extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed if the remaining cells are not exactly divisible by 15.

7. **Appending Result:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens needed to the result list.

8. **Printing Results:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example given in the problem statement:

- For the first test case (`1 1`):
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`
  - `total_space = 5`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is odd)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
  - `space_x = 1 <= 11` (true), so the result is `1`.

- For the third test case (`12 4`):
  - `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`
  - `total_space = 28`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y` is even)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`
  - `space_x = 12 <= 14` (true), so the result is `2`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct for calculating the minimum number of screens needed to place all icons. The program handles both even and odd counts of 2x2 icons correctly and ensures that the remaining cells are used optimally to fit the 1x1 icons.
