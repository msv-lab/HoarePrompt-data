The code updates the value of `space_y` to `y * 4`. This means that the value of `space_y` is now explicitly defined as `y * 4`, which is the same as before. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on `y`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`.**
