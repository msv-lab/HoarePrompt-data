Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head does not explicitly define any variables to change within the loop itself. However, the loop variable `_` is used, but it doesn't affect any other variables directly.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a fixed value and does not change within the loop, the loop will execute `n` times as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Adjust States Based on Loop Condition**: Since the loop will execute again if `n > 0`, we need to ensure that `n` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `total_space` is `y * 8 + x`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `result` is a list
- `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on `y` (either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`)
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`

For the next iteration of the loop, `n` should be decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `total_space` remains `y * 8 + x`
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is now `n - 1`
- `result` remains a list
- `space_x` remains `x * 1`
- `space_y` remains `y * 4`
- `screen_require_for_y` remains calculated based on `y`
- `remaining_cells` remains calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`

State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on `y`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`**
