Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state includes the following:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `result` is a list that contains the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration where `space_x` was greater than `remaining_cells`.
- `total_space` is the cumulative sum of `space_y + space_x` for each iteration.
- `x` and `y` are the last input integers provided for the final iteration of the loop.
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
- `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise.

In summary, the `result` list will contain the calculated values based on the conditions specified in each iteration, and `total_space` will reflect the sum of `space_y + space_x` from all iterations.
