The code updates the value of `space_y` to `y * 4`. This means that the new value of `space_y` is directly calculated from the current value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 4 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4**.
