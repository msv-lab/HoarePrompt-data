Postcondition: `total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`.
