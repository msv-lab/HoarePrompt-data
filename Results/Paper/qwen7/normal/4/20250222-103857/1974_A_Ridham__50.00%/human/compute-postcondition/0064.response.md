Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the execution of the code snippet:

1. **Result Construction**: 
   - For each iteration where `space_x > remaining_cells`, the value of `screen_require_for_y` plus `extra_screen` is appended to `result`.
   - `screen_require_for_y` is the sum of `space_y` (which is `y * 4`) and `remaining_cells` minus `space_x`.
   - `extra_screen` is determined based on whether `space_x` is divisible by 15:
     - If `space_x % 15 == 0`, then `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = space_x // 15 + 1`.

2. **Printing the Result**:
   - The `print` statement uses `'\n'.join(map(str, result))` to join all elements of the `result` list into a single string with each element on a new line.

Given the initial state, the `result` list contains the sums of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration where `space_x` was not enough to meet `remaining_cells`.

Output: **the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line**
