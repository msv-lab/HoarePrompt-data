Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

The code assigns the value of `y * 4` to the variable `space_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
