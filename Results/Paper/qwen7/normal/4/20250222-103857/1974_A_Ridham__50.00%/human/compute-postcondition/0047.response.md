Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on `y`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`.**

Explanation: The line `space_x = x * 1` updates the value of `space_x` to be equal to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
