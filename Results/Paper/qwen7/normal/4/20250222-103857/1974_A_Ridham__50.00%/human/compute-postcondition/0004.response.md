Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**

The code `space_x = x * 1` assigns the value of `x` to `space_x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
