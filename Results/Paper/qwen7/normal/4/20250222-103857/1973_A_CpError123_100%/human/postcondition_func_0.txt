The function processes up to 500 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates \(x\) as half of the sum (integer division) and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). Finally, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing and ends.
