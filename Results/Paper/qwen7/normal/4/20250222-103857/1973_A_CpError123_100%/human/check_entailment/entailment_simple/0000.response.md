Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` of the three players.
- The program checks if the sum of the scores (`a + b + c`) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the sum of points must be even for the scores to be achievable.
- If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`.
- The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which should represent the maximum possible number of draws.
- However, the logic to determine the maximum number of draws is flawed. The correct approach would involve checking if the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws without violating the constraints.

Given the example outputs and the problem statement, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. The provided solution only checks if the sum is even and prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which does not necessarily correspond to the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
