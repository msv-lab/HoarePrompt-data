Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and 500.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, it satisfies this condition.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs adjustment is `t`, and it should be set to a positive integer within the specified range.

Given the constraints, the state before the loop starts can be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 500].

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
