You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 500 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates \(x\) as half of the sum (integer division) and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). Finally, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing and ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Consistency**:
   - The program checks if `(a + b + c) % 2 == 0`. This condition ensures that the total number of points scored is even, which is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points split between two players (in case of a draw).
   - If this condition fails, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total score is inconsistent with the rules of the game.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**:
   - If the total score is even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents half of the total points scored.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which should be the maximum number of draws. This logic is based on the observation that the maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores and ensuring that the remaining points are distributed as draws.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the scores are all zero (`0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where the scores are `0 1 1` correctly by printing `1`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the scores are `1 1 2` correctly. According to the problem statement, the scores `1 1 2` are inconsistent because it is impossible to achieve these scores through a series of games under the given rules. The program should print `-1` for this case, but it prints `2` instead.

### Conclusion:

The program is almost correct, but it fails to handle the case where the scores are `1 1 2` correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
