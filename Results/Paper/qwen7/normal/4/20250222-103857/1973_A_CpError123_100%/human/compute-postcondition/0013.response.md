Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to \((a + b + c) // 2\), `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and \(t = t - 1\).**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. It does not affect the values of `x` and `y`, which were previously calculated. The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now \(t - 1\). The precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd remains unchanged.
