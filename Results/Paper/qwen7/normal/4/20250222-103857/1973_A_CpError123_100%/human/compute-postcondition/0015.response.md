The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to \((a + b + c) // 2\), `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and \(t = t - 1\).**
