Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is now `t - 1`, `y` is equal to `a + b`**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `y` to `a + b`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged, and `x` is derived from the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it remains the same. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) still holds. The value of `y` is explicitly set to `a + b`, so no further calculation is needed.
