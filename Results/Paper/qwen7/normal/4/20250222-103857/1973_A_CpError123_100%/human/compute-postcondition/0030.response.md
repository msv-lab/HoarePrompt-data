Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the conditions provided for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. Specifically, it checks if t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 500, and if p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and then returns a value based on these conditions.**
