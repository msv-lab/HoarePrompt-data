Reasoning:

1. **Check for Odd Sum**: The program correctly checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring system described (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, or 1 point to each player).

2. **Calculation of \(x\)**: The variable \(x\) is calculated as \((a + b + c) // 2\). This represents the total number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points to the total score (either 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, or 1 point to each player).

3. **Calculation of \(y\)**: The variable \(y\) is calculated as \(a + b\). This represents the maximum possible number of draws if only the first two players were involved in all games. Since each draw gives 1 point to each player, the maximum number of draws would be the sum of the points of the first two players.

4. **Determine Maximum Draws**: The program prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\). This is correct because:
   - \(x\) represents the total number of games, including both wins and draws.
   - \(y\) represents the maximum possible number of draws if we assume all games were draws between the first two players.
   - The actual number of draws cannot exceed the number of games played, hence the minimum of these two values is the correct number of draws.

5. **Handling All Test Cases**: The program processes up to 500 test cases as specified, and for each test case, it performs the necessary calculations and prints the result.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws for each test case, and it handles the constraints and conditions as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
