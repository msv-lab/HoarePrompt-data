Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. However, since the specific values of these inputs are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The conditions that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd and that `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is decreased by 1 remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these conditions and the updated value of `t` as `t - 1`.
