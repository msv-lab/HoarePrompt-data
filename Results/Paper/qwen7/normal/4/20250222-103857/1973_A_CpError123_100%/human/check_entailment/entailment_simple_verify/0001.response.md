### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The validation check `(a + b + c) % 2 == 0` is correct and ensures that the total number of points scored is even, which is necessary for the game's rules.

2. **Check for Consistency**:
   - If the total score is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total score is inconsistent with the rules of the game.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**:
   - If the total score is even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents half of the total points scored.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which should be the maximum number of draws. This logic is based on the observation that the maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores and ensuring that the remaining points are distributed as draws.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the scores are all zero (`0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - The program handles the case where the scores are `0 1 1` correctly by printing `1`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the scores are `1 1 2` correctly. According to the problem statement, the scores `1 1 2` are inconsistent because it is impossible to achieve these scores through a series of games under the given rules. The program should print `-1` for this case, but it prints `2` instead.

5. **Detailed Analysis of the Case `1 1 2`**:
   - Let's analyze why the scores `1 1 2` are inconsistent:
     - Suppose the scores are `1 1 2`. This means the total score is `4`, which is even.
     - To achieve a total score of `4`, the only possible distribution of points (considering the rules of the game) would be:
       - Two wins and one draw (2+2+1=5, not possible since the total must be 4).
       - One win, one draw, and one zero (2+1+1=4, possible).
     - However, the scores `1 1 2` cannot be achieved with just one win, one draw, and one zero because the player with `2` points must have won a game, and the other two players must have drawn, which contradicts the requirement that the player with `2` points must have won one game and drawn one game. Therefore, the scores `1 1 2` are indeed inconsistent.

Given the detailed analysis, the program fails to correctly identify the inconsistency in the case `1 1 2`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect due to its failure to handle the case where the scores are `1 1 2` correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
