Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is now `0`, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be decremented until it reaches `0`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be determined by the inputs provided during each iteration, but once the loop finishes, these values will no longer be changed. The variables `x` and `y` will retain their last computed values based on the last set of `a`, `b`, and `c` values before the loop terminated.
