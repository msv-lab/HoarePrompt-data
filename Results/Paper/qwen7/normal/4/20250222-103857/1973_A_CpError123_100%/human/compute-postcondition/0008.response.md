Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, and `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2. Since the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, dividing it by 2 will result in an integer value for `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the condition about their sum being odd remain unchanged.
