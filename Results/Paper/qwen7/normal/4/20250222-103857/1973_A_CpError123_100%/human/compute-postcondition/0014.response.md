Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - `c` is an integer from the input.
   - The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.
   - `x` is equal to \((a + b + c) // 2\).
   - `y` is equal to `a + b`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and \(t = t - 1\).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

Given the code snippet, it directly prints `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `t` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
