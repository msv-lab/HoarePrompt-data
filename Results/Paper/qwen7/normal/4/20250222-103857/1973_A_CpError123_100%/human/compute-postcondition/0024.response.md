Postcondition: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is now `t - 1`. Since the condition `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` is always true given the precondition, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
