### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Conditions for Pricing**:
   - When `a >= b`, the program prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, there is no benefit in changing the price, so all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Optimal Choice for `k`**:
   - When `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is correct because `k` represents the number of buns to be sold at the modified price to maximize profit.
   - The formula used to calculate `ans` is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This is correct as it calculates the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices.
   - The variable `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`, which correctly represents the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program correctly combines `ans` and `p2` to get the total profit and prints it. This is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `a >= b` and `a < b` appropriately. There are no missing or incorrect handling of edge cases.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and calculations are correct and align with the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
