Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user**.

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now specific integers input by the user.
