Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the user.
- `a` is the second integer input split from the user.

The print statement is `print(n * a)`. This means it will print the product of `n` and `a`.

Since `n` and `a` are integers input by the user, their exact values are not known, but we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer input and a is the second integer input)**
