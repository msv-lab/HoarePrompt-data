Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Base Case**: When `a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is correctly handled with `print(n * a)`.

2. **Promotion Strategy**: When `a < b`, the goal is to maximize profit by choosing an optimal `k`. The solution correctly identifies `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - `ans` is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns, which is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is the total revenue from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case when `k == 0` by setting `ans` to 0, which simplifies the calculation.
   - The solution also ensures that `k` does not exceed `n` or `b - a + 1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the solution correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
