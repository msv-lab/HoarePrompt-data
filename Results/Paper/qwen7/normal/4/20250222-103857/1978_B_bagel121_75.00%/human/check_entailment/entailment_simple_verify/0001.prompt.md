You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: All test cases specified by the initial integer `t` have been processed. For each test case, the output is determined based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically:
    #
    #- If `a >= b`, the output for each test case is `n * a`.
    #- If `a < b`, the output is calculated using the formula `ans + p2`, where:
    #  - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
    #  - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
    #  - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
    #
    #The final output state will contain the results of all the test cases processed according to the rules described above.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The modified price for the first `k` buns is `(b - i + 1)` coins, where `i` ranges from `1` to `k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If true, it prints `n * a` (since selling all buns at the usual price is optimal).
   - Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - It calculates the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the total profit as `ans + p2`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating `k` is correct.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is used correctly.
   - The program handles both cases (`a >= b` and `a < b`) appropriately.
   - The calculations for the profit are accurate and follow the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness:** **True**
