Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns different values based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (specified by `t`). For each test case, it takes three positive integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`) as inputs and produces some output based on their values, but the specific output is not detailed in the given information.
