Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer representing the number of test cases. For each iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `n` is the first integer input split from the user.
- `a` is the second integer input split from the user.
- `b` is the third integer input split from the user.
- If `a >= b`, the output will be `n * a`.
- If `a < b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
- The final output for each iteration will be `ans + p2`.

All these calculations will be performed for each of the `t` test cases, and the results will be printed for each iteration.
