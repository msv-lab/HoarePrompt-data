The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The previous values of `t`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are not affected. The values of `t`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` will be updated based on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `k`, `ans`, and `p2` without additional information. However, we can express them in terms of the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

- `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

This means that the values of `t`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` will be determined based on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` once they are inputted.
