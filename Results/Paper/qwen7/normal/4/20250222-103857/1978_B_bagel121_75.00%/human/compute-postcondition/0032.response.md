Output State: All test cases specified by the initial integer `t` have been processed. For each test case, the output is determined based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically:

- If `a >= b`, the output for each test case is `n * a`.
- If `a < b`, the output is calculated using the formula `ans + p2`, where:
  - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
  - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
  - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

The final output state will contain the results of all the test cases processed according to the rules described above.
