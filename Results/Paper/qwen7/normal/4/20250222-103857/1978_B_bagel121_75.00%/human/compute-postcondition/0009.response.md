Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as int((`b` + (`b` - `k` + 1)) / 2 * `k`, `p2` is (`n` - `k`) * `a`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n - k) * a` to `p2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `p2` is calculated based on the updated value of `k` and the initial values of `n` and `a`.
