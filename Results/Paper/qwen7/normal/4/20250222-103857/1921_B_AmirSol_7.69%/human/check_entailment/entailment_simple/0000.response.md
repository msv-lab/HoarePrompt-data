Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). However, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function does not correctly account for all possible operations and conditions.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**:
   - The function only considers two types of operations: moving a cat to an empty box or removing a cat from a non-empty box. It does not consider the operation of moving a cat from one box to another.
   - The logic inside the `while` loop does not properly handle the movement of cats between boxes. It only checks if the current box in `s1` is different from the corresponding box in `s2` and whether the next box in `s1` is different from the next box in `s2`.

2. **Incomplete Consideration of Conditions**:
   - The function does not fully account for the possibility of moving a cat from one box to another when both boxes are empty or both are occupied. This is crucial because it can reduce the number of operations needed.

3. **Unnecessary Increment**:
   - The function increments `counter` even when it should not, such as when the current box in `s1` is different from the corresponding box in `s2` but the next box in `s1` is the same as the next box in `s2`.

Given these issues, the provided function does not accurately compute the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.

Correctness: **False**
