Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `counter` is increased by 1.**

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. Since `counter` was either 0 or 1, it now becomes either 1 or 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i` still holds true.
