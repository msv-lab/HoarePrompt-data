Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^5 inclusive, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Additionally, either `i` is equal to `n-1`, or `s1[i+1]` is equal to `s2[i+1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i+1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
