You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'.

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. After all iterations, `counter` will hold the total number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and satisfies the conditions inside the if block. Specifically, `counter` will count the number of times `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]` and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i+1]` (if `i < n-1`), or it will simply increment `counter` by 1 if they are different but the condition for the if block is not met. 
    #
    #After all the iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to `n` because the loop increments `i` until `i` is no longer less than `n`. Therefore, the final state will be:
    #
    #- `counter` will be the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that satisfy the given conditions.
    #- `i` will be `n`.
    #- `n` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
    #- `s1` and `s2` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is characterized by `counter` holding the count of specific mismatches, `i` being equal to `n`, and `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remaining as they were initially.
    return counter
    #The program returns `counter` which holds the total number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and satisfies the conditions inside the if block, `i` is set to `n`, and `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)), and two strings \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) of length \( n \) consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the total number of positions where \( s1[i] \) is not equal to \( s2[i] \) and satisfies the conditions inside the if block. After the function execution, the variable \( i \) is set to \( n \), and the original values of \( n \), \( s1 \), and \( s2 \) remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s1` of the boxes, and the desired state `s2` of the boxes.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of boxes), `s1` (initial state), and `s2` (desired state).
   - It initializes a counter `counter` to zero.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the boxes from index `i = 0` to `n-1`.

3. **State Comparison:**
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current state `s1[i]` is different from the desired state `s2[i]`.
   - If they are different, it further checks two conditions:
     - If the next box `s1[i+1]` is also different from `s2[i+1]` and the current box `s1[i]` is not the same as the next box `s1[i+1]`.
     - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter by 1 and moves the index `i` by 2 (`i += 2`).
     - Otherwise, it increments the counter by 1 and moves the index `i` by 1 (`i += 1`).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `i` might exceed `n-1` by ensuring that the loop condition `i < n` is checked before accessing `s1[i+1]`.

5. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the counter value, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the function against the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `s1 = "10010"`
   - `s2 = "00001"`
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Explanation: Move cat from box 1 to box 5, then remove cat from box 4.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 1`
   - `s1 = "1"`
   - `s2 = "1"`
   - Expected Output: 0
   - Explanation: No changes needed.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`
   - `s1 = "000"`
   - `s2 = "111"`
   - Expected Output: 3
   - Explanation: Place a cat in each box.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 4`
   - `s1 = "0101"`
   - `s2 = "1010"`
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Explanation: Move cat from box 1 to box 2, then move cat from box 3 to box 4.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - `n = 3`
   - `s1 = "100"`
   - `s2 = "101"`
   - Expected Output: 1
   - Explanation: Move cat from box 3 to box 4.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - `n = 8`
   - `s1 = "10011001"`
   - `s2 = "11111110"`
   - Expected Output: 4
   - Explanation: Move cats as follows: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8).

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and verifying it against the provided test cases, the function appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. Therefore, the program is correct.
