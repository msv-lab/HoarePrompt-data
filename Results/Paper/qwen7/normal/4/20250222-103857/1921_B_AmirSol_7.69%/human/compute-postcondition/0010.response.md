Postcondition: `counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^5 inclusive, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Additionally, either `i` is equal to `n-1`, or `s1[i+1]` is equal to `s2[i+1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i+1]`.
