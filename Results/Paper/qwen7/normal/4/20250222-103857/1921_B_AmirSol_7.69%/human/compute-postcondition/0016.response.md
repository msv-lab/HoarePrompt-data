Output State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^5 inclusive.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 0 to 1. The values of `counter` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that the characters at index `i` in strings `s1` and `s2` are the same is still valid, but since `i` has changed, this condition now refers to the character at index 1 in both strings.
