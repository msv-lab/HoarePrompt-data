State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^5 inclusive**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i < n`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` (which starts at 0) needs to be less than `n`.
4. Since `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0.
5. Additionally, the problem states that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0 and within the specified range.
