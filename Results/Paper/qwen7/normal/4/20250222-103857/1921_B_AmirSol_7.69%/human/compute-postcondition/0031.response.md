Output State: **`counter` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4; `i` is either 4 or 5; `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` was either 2 or 3, after adding 2, `i` becomes either 4 or 5. The values of `counter` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
