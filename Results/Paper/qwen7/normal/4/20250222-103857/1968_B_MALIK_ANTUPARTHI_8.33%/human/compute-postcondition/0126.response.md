Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) (of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively). For each character in string \( a \), it finds the position in string \( b \) where the character first appears, and returns the position of the last character of \( a \) in \( b \) or the position where the character would appear if it were not found, ensuring the returned value is within the bounds of \( b \).**
