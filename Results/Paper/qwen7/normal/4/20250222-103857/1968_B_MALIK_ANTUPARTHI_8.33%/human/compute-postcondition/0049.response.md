Postcondition: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the character at index 0 of `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index 0 plus 1. The condition either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` holds true.**
