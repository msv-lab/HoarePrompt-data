Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `k` is updated to the index of `d[2]` in `e` plus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. The only change is that the program exits the hypothetical loop or conditional block it was in. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `k` is updated to the index of `d[2]` in `e` plus 1.
