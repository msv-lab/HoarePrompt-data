Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, and `e` is a list. If the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` holds true, the value of `d[j]` remains unchanged and is still present at index `k` in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of the list. If the condition does not hold, `d[j]` is not in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` is equal to `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
