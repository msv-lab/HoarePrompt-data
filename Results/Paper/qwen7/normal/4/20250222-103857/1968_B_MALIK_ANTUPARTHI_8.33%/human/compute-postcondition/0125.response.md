Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and two binary strings a and b (of lengths n and m respectively). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each involving two integers and two binary strings, and it processes these inputs without needing any parameters passed directly to it during its definition.
