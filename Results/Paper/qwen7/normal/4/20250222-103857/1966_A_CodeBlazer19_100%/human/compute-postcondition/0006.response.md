Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not specified but it's not needed for the print statement).
- `k` is an input integer (its value is not specified but it's used in the print statement).
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`.
- The maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement `print(k - 1)` simply subtracts 1 from the value of `k` and prints the result. Since `k` is an input integer, the exact value of `k - 1` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `k`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an input integer)**
