Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of test cases, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. After all iterations of the loop, if the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the output will be `k - 1`. Otherwise, the output will be `n`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will reflect the total number of test cases, `i` will be equal to `t`, and the final outputs will depend on whether the maximum count of any unique element in the list `l` is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, the output will be `k - 1`; otherwise, the output will be the total number of elements in the list `l`.
