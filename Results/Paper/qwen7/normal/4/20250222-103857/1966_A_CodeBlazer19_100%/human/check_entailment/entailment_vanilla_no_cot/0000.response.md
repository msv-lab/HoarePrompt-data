Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**: The solution checks if the maximum count of any card (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`. This is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and the card values are `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`. The maximum count here is 3, but we can still reduce the number of cards further by exchanging groups of 3 cards.

2. **Handling Cases Where Maximum Count is Less Than k**: When the maximum count of any card is less than `k`, the current logic simply prints `n`, which is incorrect. For instance, in the case where `n = 7` and `k = 2`, and the card values are `[4, 2, 1, 100, 5, 2, 3]`, the maximum count is 2, and the output should be 1 (not 7).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that we can reduce the number of cards as much as possible by repeatedly performing the allowed operations. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Group cards by their values
        from collections import Counter
        card_counts = Counter(l)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards
        min_cards = n
        for count in card_counts.values():
            min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        
        print(min_cards)

func()
```

This solution uses a `Counter` to group the cards by their values and then calculates the minimum number of cards by reducing the counts of cards that can be exchanged according to the rules.
