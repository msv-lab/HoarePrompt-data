Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged, with the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 2. The list `l` and the list of counts `p` are not affected by this code.
