Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

In this case, the code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
