Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 2 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is an input integer converted to an integer (its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `k` is an input integer converted to an integer (the value of `k` is needed for the print statement).
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer (its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l` (its value is not needed for the print statement).

The print statement is `print(k - 1)`. Since `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, the expression `k - 1` will be evaluated to `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer converted to an integer)**
