Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer converted to an integer. Since no specific value for `n` is given, it remains as an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer converted to an integer. Again, no specific value is given, so it remains as an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. The exact content of this list is not specified.
- `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. This means `p` contains the frequency count of each unique number found in `l`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n)
```

This will print the value of `n`, which is an input integer. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we represent it as such.

Output: **n (where n is the input integer)**
