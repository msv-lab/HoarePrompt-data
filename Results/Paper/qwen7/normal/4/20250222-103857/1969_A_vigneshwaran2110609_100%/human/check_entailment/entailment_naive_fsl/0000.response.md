Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party. Specifically, the program checks if any friend is the best friend of another invited friend and prints 2 if such a pair exists. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not account for scenarios where no direct pairs exist but inviting more friends can still achieve the goal.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3 1 2 5 4
```
The program would output `2`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Here, inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 would ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, as they are each other's best friends and also have invitations. Inviting only 2 friends (as the program suggests) would not guarantee that at least 2 friends come, as friend 4 and friend 5 do not have invitations from their respective best friends.

Therefore, the program fails to handle this specific case and others like it, making it incorrect.
