### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `n`. However, the function does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It processes only one test case and then exits, ignoring any subsequent test cases.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`. This part is correct.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, x):` iterates over the list of friends.
   - The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:` checks if the best friend of the current friend also considers the current friend as their best friend. If this condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that sending invitations to just these two friends is sufficient.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function does not account for multiple test cases. After processing the first test case, it should continue to process any additional test cases. However, the function does not loop back to read more test cases.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it only processes one test case and does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**
