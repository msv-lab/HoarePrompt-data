Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 22
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` determines whether `flag` is set to True and the inner loop or if statement is broken.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 22, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 23.
   - `x` must still satisfy the condition of being greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Check the Condition for the New Value of `i`**:
   - The new value of `i` is 23.
   - We need to check if `x` is greater than or equal to 23 (since `i` is now 23).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

**Final State**:
- `i` becomes 23.
- `x` must still be greater than or equal to 23.

State: **`i` is 23, `x` must be greater than or equal to 23**
