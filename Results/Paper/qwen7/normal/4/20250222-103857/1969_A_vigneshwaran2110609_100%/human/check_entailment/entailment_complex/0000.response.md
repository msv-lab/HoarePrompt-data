Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it checks for a condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` which is not relevant to the problem statement.
2. According to the problem, Monocarp needs to invite friends such that both the invited friend and their best friend (indicated by `p_i`) receive invitations. This means we need to find pairs `(i, p_i)` such that both `i` and `p_i` are invited.
3. The provided code does not handle the logic of finding such pairs. Instead, it incorrectly checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` for each index `i`, which is not part of the problem requirements.
4. Additionally, the program does not ensure that at least 2 friends are invited when printing 2, nor does it handle the case where exactly 2 friends can be invited with the minimum number of invitations.

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
