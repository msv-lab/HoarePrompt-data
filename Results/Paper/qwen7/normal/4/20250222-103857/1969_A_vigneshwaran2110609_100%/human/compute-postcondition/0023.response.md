Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `flag` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `i + 1`, then `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, and `flag` remains unchanged.
