Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. The value of `i` is 3, so `cliquess[left + 3]` is now `clique`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
