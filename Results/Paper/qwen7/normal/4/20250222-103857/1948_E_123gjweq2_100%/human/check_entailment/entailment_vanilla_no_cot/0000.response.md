Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Function Name**: The function `make_array` is defined but not called in the main function `func_1`. This means the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` will remain uninitialized and will contain zeros, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Incorrect Array Assignment**: In the `func_1` function, the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` are initialized but not properly assigned within the loop. The `make_array` function is supposed to fill these arrays, but it is never called.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `make_array` Function**: The logic in the `make_array` function is flawed. It tries to split the elements into two parts, but it does not correctly handle the assignment of values and cliques. Specifically, the indices used in the assignment do not match the expected behavior.

4. **Missing Partition Assignment**: The partition assignment logic is missing. The `cliquess` list should be filled with the correct clique assignments, but this is not done in the current implementation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    # Determine the number of cliques needed
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Initialize the arrays
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    
    # Assign values to vertices and determine cliques
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = i + 1
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1
    
    # Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are properly initialized.
- Each vertex is assigned a unique value from 1 to n.
- The graph is partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
- The partition is correctly printed.
