Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`
- `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`
- For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`
- For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(not_mid):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `not_mid - 1`.
2. **Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `not_mid`.

### Adjusted States
- Since the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `not_mid`.
- The other variables (`cliquess`, `arr`, `left`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `clique`, and `big_element`) remain unchanged.

### Final State
- `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`
- `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`
- For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`
- For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`
- `i` is now `not_mid`

### Answer
State: **`cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, and for each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`. For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`. `i` is now `not_mid`**
