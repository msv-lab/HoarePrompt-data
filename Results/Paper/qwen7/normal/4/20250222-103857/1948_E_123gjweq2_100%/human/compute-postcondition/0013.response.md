Output State: The loop iterates `mid` times. After all iterations, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. Additionally, `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The array `arr` will have elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in positions starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards.
- The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` placed in positions from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
- The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their initial values.
