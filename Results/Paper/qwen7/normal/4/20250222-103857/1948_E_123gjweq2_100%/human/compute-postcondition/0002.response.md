Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1; `mid` is (right - (left + 1) + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, substituting these values into the equation gives us `mid = ((right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `mid = (right - left + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
