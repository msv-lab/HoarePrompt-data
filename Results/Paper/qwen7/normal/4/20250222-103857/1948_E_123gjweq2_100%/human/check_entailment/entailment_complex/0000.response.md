Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as `cliques = ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes an array `arr` of size `n` filled with zeros.
   - It initializes another array `cliquess` of size `n` filled with zeros.
   - For each clique from `0` to `cliques - 1`, it calls the `make_array` function to fill parts of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` based on the specified ranges and the clique identifier.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills parts of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.
   - It divides the range `[left, right]` into two halves and fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.

3. **Graph Construction and Partition**:
   - The problem requires constructing a graph where each vertex is assigned a unique integer from 1 to `n` and edges are added based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`.
   - The solution provided uses the `make_array` function to partition the vertices into cliques, ensuring that each clique forms a complete subgraph.
   - The partitioning ensures that the graph can be divided into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the array `arr`, the number of cliques, and the array `cliquess` which represents the partitioning of the graph into cliques.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the program correctly constructs the graph and partitions it into the minimum number of cliques. The `make_array` function ensures that the vertices are assigned values such that the resulting graph meets the conditions specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
