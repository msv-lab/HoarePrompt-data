Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(mid)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\)
   - `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\)
   - `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier
   - `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\)
   - `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\)
   - `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\)
   - `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\)
   - `i` is 2
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i - 1`
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

4. **Update the Relevant States**: We need to update the state of `i` to reflect its new value. All other states remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\), `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `i` is 3, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`**
