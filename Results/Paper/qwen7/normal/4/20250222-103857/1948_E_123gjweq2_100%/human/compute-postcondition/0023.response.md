Output State: **`cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`, and `i` is now `not_mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Since `i` is now incremented by 1 (from the previous loop), its new value is `not_mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
