Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `mid - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Update the State**:
   - `left`: Remains unchanged.
   - `right`: Remains unchanged.
   - `clique`: Remains unchanged.
   - `small_element`: Remains unchanged.
   - `big_element`: Remains unchanged.
   - `mid`: Remains unchanged since it is calculated as \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\).
   - `not_mid`: Remains unchanged since it is calculated as \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\).

4. **Adjust `i`**: Since the loop runs from `0` to `mid - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0` (if this is the first iteration) or `i + 1` (for subsequent iterations).

5. **Loop Body Effects**: The loop body updates `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `small_element + i` for each valid `i`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, the element `arr[left + mid - (i + 1) - 1]` will be updated to `small_element + (i + 1)`.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\), `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `i` is 0**.

However, if this is not the first iteration, then `i` will be `i + 1` where `i` was in the previous iteration. For the first iteration, `i` is `0`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\), `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `i` is 0**.
