Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(not_mid):
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = not_mid - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `not_mid - 1` at the end of the current iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` will be `not_mid - 1` at the end of the current iteration, the state of `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` will be set to `clique`.
   - Similarly, the state of `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` will be set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`.

### Final State:
- `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`.

### Answer:
State: **`cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`**
