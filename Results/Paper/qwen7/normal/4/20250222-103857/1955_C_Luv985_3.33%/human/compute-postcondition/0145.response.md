Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `l` must be less than `r`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is increased by 1 to 1, and `l` is increased by 1 to `l + 1`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been increased by 1, making it 1, and `l` has been increased by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
