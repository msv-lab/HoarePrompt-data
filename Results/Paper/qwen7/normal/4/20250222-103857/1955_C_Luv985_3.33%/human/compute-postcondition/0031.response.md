Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2`.**

The code `t = k % 2` assigns the value of `k % 2` to the variable `t`. Since `k` is an integer greater than 0, `k % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we cannot specify whether `t` is 0 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
