Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 2, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, the list `a` is now a list of integers where `a[r]` (which is `a[n-2]`) is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, and the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `a[r]` is 0.
