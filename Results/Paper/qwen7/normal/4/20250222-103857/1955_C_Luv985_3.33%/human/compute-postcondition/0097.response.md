Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` (which is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`) from `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a[r]` is updated to be its original value minus `mi`.
