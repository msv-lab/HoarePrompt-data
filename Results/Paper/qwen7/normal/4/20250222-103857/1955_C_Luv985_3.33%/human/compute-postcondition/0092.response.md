Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer converted from the input string, `k` is an integer converted from the input string, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
