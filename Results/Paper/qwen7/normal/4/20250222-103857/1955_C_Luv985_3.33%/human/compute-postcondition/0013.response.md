Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `mi` is assigned the minimum value between `a[l]` (which is `a[0]`) and `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
