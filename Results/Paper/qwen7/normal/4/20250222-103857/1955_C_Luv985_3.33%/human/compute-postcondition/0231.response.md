Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 3 or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is either 0 and `r` is `n - 2` or `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 3`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
