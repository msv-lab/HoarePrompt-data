Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, the current value of `a[l]` is 0, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was set to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
