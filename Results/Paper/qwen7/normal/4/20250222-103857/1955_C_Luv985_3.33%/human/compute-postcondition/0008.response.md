Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is converted to an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` applies the lambda function `lambda x: int(x)` to each element `x` in the list `a`. This converts each string in the list `a` to an integer. The variables `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
