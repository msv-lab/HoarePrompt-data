Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), the program correctly prints `1`, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.
   - However, if \( k < n - 1 \), the program incorrectly prints `n - 1`. It should consider the optimal way to destroy bridges such that Everule can still visit the maximum possible number of islands while minimizing the number of islands he can visit.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, we need to ensure that Everule cannot travel from island 1 to any other island. This means destroying enough bridges such that island 1 is isolated from all other islands.
   - The optimal strategy is to destroy bridges in such a way that island 1 is disconnected from all other islands. This can be achieved by destroying bridges connecting island 1 to all other islands. The number of such bridges is \( n - 1 \).

3. **Correct Solution**:
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), Everule can still visit all islands because \( k \) bridges are not sufficient to isolate island 1 completely. Therefore, the answer should be \( n \).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the output is correct according to the problem statement.
