Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i`, `t`, and the range parameters (which are not explicitly named but are part of the loop definition).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `t-1` with a step of `1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `k` is an integer from the input.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then no change is made to the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then no change is made to the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` either.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `t`, we need to check the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If `i` is less than `t - 1`, the loop will continue. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `i` is equal to `t - 1`, the loop will terminate.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - If `i` was less than `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the postconditions.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1` where `i` was less than `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.**

However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `i` is updated to `i + 1` if `i < t - 1`.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 998 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `i` is 999.**

In general form:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `i` is updated to `i + 1` if `i < t - 1`.**
