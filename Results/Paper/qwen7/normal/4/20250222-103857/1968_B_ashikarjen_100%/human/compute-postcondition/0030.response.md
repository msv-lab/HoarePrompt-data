Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` is no longer within the bounds of `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 3 for the first 3 iterations and then increased by 1 for each subsequent iteration, `j + 2` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.**
