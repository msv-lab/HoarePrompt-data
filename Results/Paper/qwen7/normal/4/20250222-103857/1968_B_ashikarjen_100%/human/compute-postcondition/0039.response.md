Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while j < m and b[j] != a[i]`. The variables involved in the loop condition are `j` and `b[j]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.
   - `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `m` and `b[j]` must still not be equal to `a[i]`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that:
- `j` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`.
- `b[j]` remains not equal to `a[i]`.

Since `j` is already incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `m` and `b[j]` is still not equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
