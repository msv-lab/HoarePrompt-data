Output State: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1 with each iteration until it either equals `m` or finds an element in `b` that matches `a[i]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of times the loop has run (which is the same as the index of the last element in `a` that was checked), `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will be the value it reached during the last iteration of the loop (either equal to `m` if no match was found or the index where a matching element was found in `b`).
