### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Strings**: For each test case, it correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `k` and `j` to 0, where `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to iterate through `b`.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - It iterates through each character of `a` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a while loop to find the current character of `a` in `b`. If the character is found, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next character in `b`.
   - If the character is not found, it breaks out of the loop since no further characters in `a` can form a subsequence of `b` starting from the current position in `b`.
5. **Output**: After processing all characters of `a`, it prints the value of `k`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in the program correctly implements the required functionality. The program handles all edge cases and follows the specifications accurately.
