Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a string, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
