Output State: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1 each time the loop runs until `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[0]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` remains greater than or equal to 1 as it is not involved in the loop condition or body. The variable `j` will be incremented until either `j` is no longer less than `m` (i.e., `j` becomes equal to or greater than `m`) or `b[j]` equals `a[0]`.
