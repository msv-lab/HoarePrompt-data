Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**.

The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The conditions for `n`, `i`, and the relationship between `j` and `m` and the condition involving `b[j]` and `a[i]` remain unchanged.
