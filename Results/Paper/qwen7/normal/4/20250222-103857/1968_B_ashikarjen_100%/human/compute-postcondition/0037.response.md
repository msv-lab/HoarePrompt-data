Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `j < m`: This condition checks if `j` is less than `m`.
   - `b[j] != a[i]`: This condition checks if the element at index `j` in array `b` is not equal to the element at the current value of `i` in array `a`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `j + 2` is less than `m`.
   - `b[j + 2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.
   - From the current state, we know that `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - We also know that `j + 2` is less than `m`, which implies that `j` is less than `m - 2`.
   - To satisfy `j < m`, `j` must be less than `m` but not necessarily equal to `m - 1` (since `j + 2` being less than `m` means `j` could be `m - 3` or lower).
   - To satisfy `b[j] != a[i]`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `j` must be such that `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` holds true.

Given these points, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

- `j` must be such that `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
