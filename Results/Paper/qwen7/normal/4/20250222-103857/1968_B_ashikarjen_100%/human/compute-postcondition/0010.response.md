Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`
   - `j` is increased by 1 (implying `j` was incremented in the last iteration)

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.
   - Since `j` was incremented in the last iteration, let's denote the new value of `j` as `j_new = j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j_new` must still satisfy `j_new < m` and `b[j_new] != a[i]`.

Given the current state:
- `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]` before the increment.
- After incrementing `j`, the new value of `j` should still be less than `m` and `b[j]` should not be equal to `a[i]`.

Since `j` is increased by 1, the new condition for the loop to execute again is:
- `j + 1 < m` (which simplifies to `j < m - 1`)
- `b[j + 1] != a[i]`

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure these conditions hold true.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m - 1` and `b[j + 1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`, and `j` is increased by 1**
