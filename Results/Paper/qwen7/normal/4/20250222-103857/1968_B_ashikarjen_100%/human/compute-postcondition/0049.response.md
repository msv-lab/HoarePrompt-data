Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is no longer less than `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `j` is incremented by 1 each time until it either meets or exceeds `m`, the condition `j < m` would become false, and the loop would terminate. The `break` statement ensures that we exit the loop, and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
