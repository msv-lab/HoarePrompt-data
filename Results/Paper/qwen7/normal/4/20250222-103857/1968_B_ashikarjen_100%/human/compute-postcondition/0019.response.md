Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` equals `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is checked to be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is set to equal `m`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged except that the loop or conditional block is exited.
