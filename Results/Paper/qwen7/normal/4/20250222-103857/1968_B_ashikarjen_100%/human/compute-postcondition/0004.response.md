Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a string, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.**

The code `j = 0` initializes the variable `j` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
