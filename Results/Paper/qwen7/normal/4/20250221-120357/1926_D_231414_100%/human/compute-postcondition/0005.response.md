Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `dic`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n` and `data`, while adding the new variable `dic` which is an empty dictionary.
