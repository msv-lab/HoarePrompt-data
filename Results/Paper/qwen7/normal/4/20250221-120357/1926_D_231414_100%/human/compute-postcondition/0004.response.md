Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `data`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an input integer.
