Reasoning:
The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but it is not implementing the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it is not checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The current implementation of `func_1()` is counting something else. It is essentially counting the number of integers up to `n` that are perfect squares, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

3. **Missing Implementation**: The core logic needed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions is missing. This involves iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these points, the program as provided does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
