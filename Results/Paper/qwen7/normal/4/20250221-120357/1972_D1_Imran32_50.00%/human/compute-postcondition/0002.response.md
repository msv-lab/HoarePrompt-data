Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^6, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**.

This means that the variable `root` has been assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
