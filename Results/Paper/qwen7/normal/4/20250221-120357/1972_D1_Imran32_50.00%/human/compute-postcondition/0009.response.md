Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, root + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `root`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(2, root + 1)`. This means `i` must be less than `root + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `root` must be at least 3
   - `cnt` is 9 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `ans` is 4 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `root` must still be at least 4 (since `i` starts from 2 and goes up to but does not include `root + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `root` must be at least 4**
