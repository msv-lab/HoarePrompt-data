Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[-1]`. If `n` equals -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` originally contains `[b, -1]`. After appending `n`, `path_ba` becomes `[b, -1, n]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
