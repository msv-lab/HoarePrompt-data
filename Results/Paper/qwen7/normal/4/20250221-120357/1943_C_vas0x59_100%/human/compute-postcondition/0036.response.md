Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n` to be the value at the index specified by `path_ba[-1]`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`, the last element is `-1`. Therefore, `n` is updated to be `previous[-1]`. The values of `d`, `b`, and `path_ba` remain unchanged.
