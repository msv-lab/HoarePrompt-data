Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is `v - 2`, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Initially, `u` was an integer from the input decreased by 2. After executing the code, `u` becomes an integer from the input decreased by 3. Similarly, `v` was `v - 1` initially, so after the code, `v` becomes `v - 2`. The list `u2vs[v]` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
