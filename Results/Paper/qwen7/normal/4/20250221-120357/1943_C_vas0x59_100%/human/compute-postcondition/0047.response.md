Output State: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, where each `ni` represents the sequence of nodes traversed until `n` becomes -1, and the loop breaks when `n` equals -1.

In this final state, `path_ba` will contain the complete path from the starting node (index 0) to the node where the loop terminates (indicated by `n` becoming -1), including all intermediate nodes visited during the breadth-first search process.
