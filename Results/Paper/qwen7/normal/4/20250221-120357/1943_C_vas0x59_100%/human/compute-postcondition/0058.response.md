Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ci` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1)]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.
   - Since `ci` is currently 0, `ci + 1` is 1.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it does not satisfy the condition `i < ci + 1`.
   - Hence, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ci` remains unchanged as the loop does not execute again.
   - `i` remains 1 as the loop does not execute again.
   - `ops` remains unchanged as the loop does not execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the end of the current iteration) is:

**State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1)]***
