Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `d` is the result of a breadth-first search starting from index 0.
   - `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` with at least 4 elements.
   - `c1` is `b`.
   - `c2` is 1.
   - `ci1` is -1.
   - `ci2` is 0.
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, otherwise `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]` if `len(path_ba)` is even and `ci` is 0, `i` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
   ```

3. **Determine `ops`:**
   - Since `path_ba` has at least 4 elements, it must be odd (as per the condition that if `len(path_ba)` is odd, then `ops` contains `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`).
   - Therefore, `ops` is `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]`.

4. **Substitute the values:**
   - `c1` is `b`.
   - `c2` is 1.
   - So, `ops` becomes `[(b, 3), (1, 3), (1, 5)]`.

5. **Map and Print:**
   - The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` will transform each tuple `(b, 3)` to `"b + 1 3"`, `(1, 3)` to `"1 + 1 3"`, and `(1, 5)` to `"1 + 1 5"`.
   - Therefore, the map function will produce the strings `"b + 1 3"`, `"2 3"`, and `"2 5"`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks these strings and `sep='\n'` ensures they are printed on separate lines.

Output: **b + 1 3  
2 3  
2 5**
