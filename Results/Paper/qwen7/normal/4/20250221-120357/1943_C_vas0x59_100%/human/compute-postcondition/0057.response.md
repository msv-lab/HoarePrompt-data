Output State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains one tuple `(c, 0)`, where `c` is 0. After executing `ops.append((c, i))`, the list `ops` now contains two tuples: `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. The values of `ci` and `i` remain unchanged.
