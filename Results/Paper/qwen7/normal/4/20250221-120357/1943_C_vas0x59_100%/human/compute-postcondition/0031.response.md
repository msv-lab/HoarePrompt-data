Output State: **Postcondition: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, the current value of `n` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of `d`, `b`, `path_ba`, or `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the given code, the values remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we exit the innermost control structure.
