Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is `v - 3`, `u2vs[u]` now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is 1.
- `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 3.
- `v` is `v - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `v - 3`.
- The line `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` (which is `v - 3`) to the list `u2vs[u]`. Since `u2vs[u]` was initially empty, it now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1, u]` appended with `v-3`, resulting in `[v-1, u, v-1, u, v-3]`.

Therefore, the updated state includes these changes while keeping the initial conditions for `n` and the expressions for `u` and `v`.
