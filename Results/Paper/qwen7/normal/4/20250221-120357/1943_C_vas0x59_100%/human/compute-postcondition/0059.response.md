Output State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c` is `ci` (which is 0) and `i` is 1, the tuple `(0, 1)` is appended to the existing list `ops`. The original list `ops` was `[(0, 0), (0, 1)]`, and after appending `(0, 1)`, it becomes `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]`. The values of `ci` and `i` remain unchanged.
