Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1],` and the current value of `n` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `path_ba.append(n)` appends the current value of `n`, which is -1, to the list `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` originally contained the value `b`, after appending `-1`, it now contains `[b, -1]`. The values of `d` and `b` remain unchanged.
