Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length n where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is set to an empty list, meaning that initially, there are no neighbors for any vertex in the tree. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` still holds true.
