Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains the value `v` (as per the initial state). After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, `u2vs[v]` will contain both `v` and `u`, forming a list `[v, u]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
