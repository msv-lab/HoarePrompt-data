Output State: **`ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` and must have at least 2 elements, `c2` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, i)`**.

Explanation: The line `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, it remains unspecified. The values of other variables (`ci1`, `ci2`, `c1`, `d`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `c2`) remain unchanged.
