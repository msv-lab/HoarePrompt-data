Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2 = ans1` does not change the values of any variables. It simply assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans1`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only thing that changes is that `ans2` now holds the same value as `ans1`.
