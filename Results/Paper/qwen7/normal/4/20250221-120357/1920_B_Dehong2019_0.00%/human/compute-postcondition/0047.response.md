Output State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = x-1`), `ans1` will be the initial sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. This is because in each iteration, `ans1` is reduced by twice the `i`-th element of `a`, and this happens `x` times. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
