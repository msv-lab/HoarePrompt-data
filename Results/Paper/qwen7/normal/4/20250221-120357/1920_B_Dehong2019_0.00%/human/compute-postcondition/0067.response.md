Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 3, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[3]` if `3 + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[2]`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `i + x` becomes `3 + x`. Therefore, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[3 + x]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
