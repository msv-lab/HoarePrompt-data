Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[0] + a[i]`, and if `0 + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[0 + x]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]`.
- The code `ans1 += a[i]` increases `ans1` by `a[i]`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ans1` is now increased by `a[1]`.
- The condition `0 + x < n` and the subsequent decrease of `ans1` by `2 * a[0 + x]` remain unchanged because the value of `i` does not affect the condition or the value of `x` is not specified.
- `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
