Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This ensures that the largest elements are considered first, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The program calculates two possible outcomes (`ans1` and `ans2`):
     - `ans1` is the sum of the array after removing the smallest `x` elements (twice) and then adding the smallest `k` elements.
     - `ans2` is the sum of the array after removing the smallest `k` elements and then adjusting `ans1` by adding and subtracting the appropriate elements.
   - The final answer is the maximum of these two outcomes, which correctly reflects the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, Alice can remove the entire array, making the sum zero.
   - If `x` is equal to `n`, Bob can negate the entire array, making the sum zero.
   - The program handles these edge cases correctly by ensuring that the adjustments are made within the bounds of the array.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case, which is the correct final answer.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob's moves.

Correctness: **True**
