Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression `i + x` simplifies to `x`. Therefore, `ans1` is updated to `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
