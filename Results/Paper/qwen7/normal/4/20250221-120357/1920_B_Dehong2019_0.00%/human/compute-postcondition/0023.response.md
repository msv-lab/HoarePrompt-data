Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is `ans1` + `a[1]`, `ans` is max(`ans1`, `ans2`)**

Explanation: The code increments `i` by 1, so `i` changes from 1 to 2. The value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i-1]` (which is `a[1]`) to its current value. The conditions and values of `k` and `ans` remain unchanged.
