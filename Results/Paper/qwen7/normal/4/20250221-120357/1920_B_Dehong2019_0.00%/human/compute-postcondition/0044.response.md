Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the `i`-th element of `a`, `ans` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting twice the `i`-th element of `a`. Since `i` is equal to `x`, `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in `a` minus four times the `x`-th element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
