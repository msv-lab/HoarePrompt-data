Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state before the loop, we know that `i` is `4 + x`.
   - We also know that `k` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` will execute if `k` is at least 1 (since `range(k)` generates numbers from 0 to `k-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `k` being at least 1, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `i` (which is `4 + x`) does not affect whether the loop can execute, but it should be consistent with the initial state provided.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be greater than or equal to 1**
