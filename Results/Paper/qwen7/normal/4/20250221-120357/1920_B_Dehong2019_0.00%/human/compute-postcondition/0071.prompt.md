Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`. If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` remains increased by `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[i]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 3, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by either `a[3]` or `a[2]` depending on whether `3 + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x], ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
