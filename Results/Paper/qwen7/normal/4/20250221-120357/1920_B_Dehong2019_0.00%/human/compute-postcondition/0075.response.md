Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. Since `k` was initially 0, its value remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is also unchanged as it depends on `ans1` and `ans2`, which are not affected by the input. The value of `i` remains 4, and `t` must still be greater than 0, as no operation was performed on it. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are now known to be integers from the input.
