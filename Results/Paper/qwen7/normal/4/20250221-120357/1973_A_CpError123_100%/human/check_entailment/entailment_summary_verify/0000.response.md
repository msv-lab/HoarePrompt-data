### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary to evaluate its correctness.

#### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the sum of the scores \(a + b + c\) is even. If it is not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates \(x\) as half the sum of the scores and \(y\) as \(a + b\), and prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\).

Here is the given program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
- It checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even.
- If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
- For each valid set of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), it calculates \(x\) as half the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) rounded down, and \(y\) as \(a + b\). It prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable.
2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) is not directly related to the number of draws. Instead, it seems to be a simplification or misinterpretation of the problem. The program does not account for the distribution of points due to draws.
3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program does not explicitly calculate the maximum number of draws. It only prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\), which does not necessarily correspond to the maximum number of draws.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Input: `0 0 0`**
  - Sum is even: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even).
  - \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\).
  - Output: `0` (correct).
- **Input: `0 1 1`**
  - Sum is even: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even).
  - \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\).
  - Output: `1` (correct).
- **Input: `1 1 2`**
  - Sum is even: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even).
  - \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\).
  - Output: `2` (correct).

However, the program does not handle the case where the scores are achievable through draws correctly. For example, the input `1 1 2` should result in `2` draws, but the program prints `2` without considering the distribution of points due to draws.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to account for the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
