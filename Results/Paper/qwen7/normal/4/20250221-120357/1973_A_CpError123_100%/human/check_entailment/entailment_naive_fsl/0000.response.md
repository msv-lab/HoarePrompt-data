Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility of draws in the scoring mechanism. The program calculates the total points and checks if they are even, but it does not properly determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.

For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, this score set is achievable with 2 draws (one draw between the first and second player, and one draw between the second and third player). However, the program incorrectly prints `-1` because it only checks if the total points are even and does not consider the distribution of points due to draws.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = min(a + b - 2 * (b - c), (a + b + c) // 2 - (b - c))
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given scores, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
