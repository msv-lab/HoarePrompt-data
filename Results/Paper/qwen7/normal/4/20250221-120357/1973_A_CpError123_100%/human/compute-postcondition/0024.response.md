The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even also remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even.**
