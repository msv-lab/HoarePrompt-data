Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by checking if the sum of the scores \(a + b + c\) is even. If it is not, the function correctly prints `-1` because an odd sum cannot be formed by the rules of the game (where each game results in an even distribution of points).

If the sum is even, the function calculates \(x\) as \((a + b + c) // 2\) and \(y\) as \(a + b\). The logic behind printing \(\min(x, y)\) is to find the maximum possible number of draws. Hereâ€™s why:

- Each game can either end in a win/loss (2 points for one player, 0 for the other) or a draw (1 point for each player).
- The total number of points distributed among the three players is \(a + b + c\).
- Since each draw contributes 2 points to the total score (1 point for each player), the maximum number of draws would be \((a + b + c) // 2\).
- However, since we need to account for the fact that the players might have played against each other in different combinations, the actual maximum number of draws is constrained by the sum of the points scored by the first two players (\(a + b\)).

Thus, \(\min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b)\) gives the maximum possible number of draws.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the function appears to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
