Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is the total number of iterations `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down for each iteration where the sum is even, `y` is `a + b` for each iteration, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even for each iteration where `min(x, y)` is printed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations, `_` will be equal to `t`, and for each of the `t` iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be as they were input during those iterations. The variable `x` will contain the value of `(a + b + c) // 2` rounded down for each iteration where the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even, and `y` will be `a + b` for each iteration. The loop ensures that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even before calculating `min(x, y)`, so `y` will always be used in the comparison when it is even.
