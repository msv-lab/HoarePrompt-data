Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the sum of points from games must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to another, or 1 point to each player).

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: 
   - The variable `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have been played, since each game awards a total of 2 points.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. Since each draw gives 1 point to each player, the maximum number of draws is limited by the smaller of `x` and `y`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the sum of points is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - For the case where the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem statement and correctly computes the maximum number of draws for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
