Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is the final iteration count of the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down for each iteration, `y` is `a + b` for each iteration, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration is even. The final value of `_` will be `t`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the last set of inputs provided by the user.
