Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(a + b + c)` is even. This is because the total points distributed among the players must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because if the sum is odd, it's impossible to distribute the points according to the rules of the game.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This value represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `a + b`, which represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved, and thus the maximum number of draws is limited by the minimum of the total number of games and the points scored by the first two players.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
  - Total games: `0 // 2 = 0`
  - Points scored by first two players: `0 + 0 = 0`
  - Output: `min(0, 0) = 0`

- **Test Case 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
  - Total games: `2 // 2 = 1`
  - Points scored by first two players: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `min(1, 1) = 1`

- **Test Case 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
  - Output: `-1`

- **Test Case 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
  - Total games: `4 // 2 = 2`
  - Points scored by first two players: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `min(2, 2) = 2`

- **Test Case 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
  - Output: `-1`

- **Test Case 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
  - Total games: `12 // 2 = 6`
  - Points scored by first two players: `3 + 4 = 7`
  - Output: `min(6, 7) = 6`

- **Test Case 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
  - Total games: `12 // 2 = 6`
  - Points scored by first two players: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `min(6, 2) = 2`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints. It handles the cases where the sum of scores is odd by returning `-1` and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
