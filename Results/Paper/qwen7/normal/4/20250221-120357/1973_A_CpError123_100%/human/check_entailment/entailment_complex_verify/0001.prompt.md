You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is the total number of iterations `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down for each iteration where the sum is even, `y` is `a + b` for each iteration, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even for each iteration where `min(x, y)` is printed.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations, `_` will be equal to `t`, and for each of the `t` iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be as they were input during those iterations. The variable `x` will contain the value of `(a + b + c) // 2` rounded down for each iteration where the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even, and `y` will be `a + b` for each iteration. The loop ensures that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even before calculating `min(x, y)`, so `y` will always be used in the comparison when it is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. It then checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. For each valid set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, and `y` as `a + b`. It prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(a + b + c)` is even. This is because the total points distributed among the players must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because if the sum is odd, it's impossible to distribute the points according to the rules of the game.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This value represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `a + b`, which represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved, and thus the maximum number of draws is limited by the minimum of the total number of games and the points scored by the first two players.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
  - Total games: `0 // 2 = 0`
  - Points scored by first two players: `0 + 0 = 0`
  - Output: `min(0, 0) = 0`

- **Test Case 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
  - Total games: `2 // 2 = 1`
  - Points scored by first two players: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `min(1, 1) = 1`

- **Test Case 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
  - Output: `-1`

- **Test Case 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
  - Total games: `4 // 2 = 2`
  - Points scored by first two players: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `min(2, 2) = 2`

- **Test Case 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
  - Output: `-1`

- **Test Case 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
  - Total games: `12 // 2 = 6`
  - Points scored by first two players: `3 + 4 = 7`
  - Output: `min(6, 7) = 6`

- **Test Case 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
  - Total games: `12 // 2 = 6`
  - Points scored by first two players: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `min(6, 2) = 2`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints. It handles the cases where the sum of scores is odd by returning `-1` and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid cases.
