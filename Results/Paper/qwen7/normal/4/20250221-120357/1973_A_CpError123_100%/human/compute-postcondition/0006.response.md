Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd also remains valid.
