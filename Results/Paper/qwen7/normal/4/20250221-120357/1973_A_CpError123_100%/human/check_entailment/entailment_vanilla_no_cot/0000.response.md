Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Points**: The total points `x` should be calculated as `(2 * a + b + c) // 2` because each win contributes 2 points, and each draw contributes 1 point to both players involved.

2. **Incorrect Use of `y`**: The variable `y` is defined as `a + b`, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Instead, you need to consider the points distribution more carefully.

3. **Handling Draws**: The logic to find the maximum number of draws needs to be adjusted. The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the points distribution and ensuring the constraints are met.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (2 * a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_points = (2 * a + b + c) // 2
        max_draws = min(total_points - a - b, c - b)
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected program checks if the total points are even, calculates the maximum possible number of draws, and ensures that the points distribution is valid.
