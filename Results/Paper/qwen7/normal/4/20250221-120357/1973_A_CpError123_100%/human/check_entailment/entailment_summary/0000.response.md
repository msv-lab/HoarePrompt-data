Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the sum of the scores (`a + b + c`) is even. If the sum is odd, it correctly prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 2 points in total in case of a draw).
- For each valid set of scores where the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` (rounded down), and `y` as `a + b`. The logic behind this is to find the maximum possible number of draws.
- However, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. The formula used to find the minimum of `x` and `y` does not accurately represent the maximum possible number of draws.
- To correctly find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
  - Each draw gives 1 point to each player, contributing 2 points in total.
  - Each win/loss scenario gives 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, contributing 2 points in total.
- The correct approach involves calculating the number of wins and then determining the maximum number of draws. The number of wins can be calculated as `total_points / 2 - max_draws`, and the remaining points should be distributed as draws.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
