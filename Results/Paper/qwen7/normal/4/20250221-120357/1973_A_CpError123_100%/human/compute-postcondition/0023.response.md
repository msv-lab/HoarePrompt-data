Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `_` is 3.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
- `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down.
- `y` is `a + b`.
- The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values entered by the user.

The `print(-1)` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
