The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`kq1` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0])) + a[1]` or `0 + a[1]`, `kq2` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0])) + a[2]` or `x + a[2]`, `vt` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))**.
