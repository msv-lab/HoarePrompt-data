Postcondition: **`kq1` is either the string "x" or 'y', `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. Depending on whether `a[i] > b[i]` is true, `kq1` is set to "x" and `kq2` includes the value of `y`, or `kq1` is set to 'y' and `kq2` includes the value of `x`. `vt` is 1, `i` is either 2 or 1, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.**
