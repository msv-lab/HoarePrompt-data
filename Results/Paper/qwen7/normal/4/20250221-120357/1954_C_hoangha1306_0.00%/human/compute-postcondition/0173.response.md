Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the sequence `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `kq1` and `kq2` are strings.
   - `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `vt` is 0.
   - `q` is `t`.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
   - `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `len(a)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `i` must now be less than `len(a)` for the loop to continue.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `kq1` and `kq2` remain unchanged as they depend on the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, which will be updated in the next iteration.
   - `vt`, `q`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`.**
