Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `kq1` is a string containing the concatenation of the minimum of each pair of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` if they are equal, or the smaller element if they are not equal, and `kq2` is a string containing the concatenation of the maximum of each pair of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` if they are equal, or the larger element if they are not equal. `vt` is 1, `i` is the length of list `a`, and `x` and `y` are no longer defined since they are local variables within the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `kq1` will contain the cumulative string of the smaller values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, and `kq2` will contain the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair. The variable `vt` remains set to 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once, and `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`. The variables `x` and `y` are no longer relevant as they were used within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kq1` is a string that concatenates 'x' or 'y' based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each iteration, and `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. `vt` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])` if any comparisons were made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that contain the concatenation of characters based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(a)-1`. The final values of `kq1` and `kq2` will be determined by the following rules:

- If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, both `kq1` and `kq2` will append `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` and `vt` is 0, `kq1` will append `str(int(a[i]))` and `kq2` will append `str(int(b[i]))`.
- If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]` and `vt` is 0, `kq1` will append `str(int(b[i]))` and `kq2` will append `str(int(a[i]))`.
- If `vt` is 1 (indicating a previous non-equal comparison), `kq1` will append `str(y)` and `kq2` will append `str(x)`.

After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, and `vt` will retain its final value indicating whether there was at least one non-equal comparison during the loop's execution. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `q` is `t`, which also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
