Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes `str(y)` appended to it, `kq2` is a string that includes `str(x)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `kq1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `x` remains the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` remains the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq1` remains a string that includes `str(y)` appended to it. The new state of `kq2` is updated to include `str(x)` appended to its current value.
