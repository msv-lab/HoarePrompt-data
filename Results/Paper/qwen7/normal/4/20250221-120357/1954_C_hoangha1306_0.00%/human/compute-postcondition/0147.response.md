Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`.
