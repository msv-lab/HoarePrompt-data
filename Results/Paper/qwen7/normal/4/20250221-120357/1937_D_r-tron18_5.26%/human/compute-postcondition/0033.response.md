Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Since `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and the other variables (`suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd`) are not directly affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated using the given formula.
