Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-1] + i + 1 + suffZero[-2]]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]**.

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` as the sum of the last two elements of the list `suffZero`. Initially, `suffZero` is a list containing one element, which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. After adding the second element, `suffZero` becomes `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-1] + i + 1 + suffZero[-2]]`. The value of `zeroInd` is set to the sum of these last two elements, which is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
