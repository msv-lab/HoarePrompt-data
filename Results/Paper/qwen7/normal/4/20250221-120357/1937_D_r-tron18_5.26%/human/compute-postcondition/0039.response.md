Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `zeroInd - oneInd` if `zr > ol`, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated differently in each case.
