Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of `n` zeros using the list multiplication operator. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged from their initial states.
