Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero` is a list containing `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, and `i` is `n-2`, the last element of `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
