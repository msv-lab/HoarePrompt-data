Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>', indicating the direction of movement. The pinball's movement and the direction indicators change after each move until the pinball leaves the grid.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction indicated by the cell.
   - After each move, the direction indicator at the current cell is flipped.
   - The pinball continues moving until it leaves the grid (either leftmost or rightmost cell).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that seems to be incorrectly implemented, as its logic does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - `func_1` is not correctly implemented and does not serve the intended purpose of calculating the required values for the pinball simulation.
   - The logic in `func_2` is complex but seems to attempt to handle the pinball movement and direction changes correctly. However, the implementation of `func_1` might lead to incorrect results due to its flawed logic.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the core logic in `func_2` appears to be correct in terms of handling the pinball movement and direction changes.
   - However, since `func_1` is not functioning as expected, the overall correctness of the solution cannot be guaranteed without fixing or removing `func_1`.

Conclusion:
- Despite the complexity and apparent correctness of the main logic in `func_2`, the presence of the incorrectly implemented `func_1` makes the overall solution unreliable.

Correctness: **False**
