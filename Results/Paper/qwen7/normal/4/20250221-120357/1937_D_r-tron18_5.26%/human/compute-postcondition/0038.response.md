Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `zeroInd` is greater than `ol`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` to be the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ans[i]` based on the calculation provided.
