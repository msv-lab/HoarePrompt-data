Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` or `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, and `preOne` is updated by removing its last element.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `preOne` is updated by removing its last element, but since the exact elements are not specified, we only note that `preOne` has been modified accordingly.
