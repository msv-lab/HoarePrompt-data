Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` or `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is updated based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts, and `preOne` is updated by removing its last element.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, or `ans[i]`. However, it updates the state of `preOne` by reducing its length by one.
