Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]**.

The code assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero[-1]` is the last element in the list `suffZero`, the value of `zeroInd` is twice that value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
