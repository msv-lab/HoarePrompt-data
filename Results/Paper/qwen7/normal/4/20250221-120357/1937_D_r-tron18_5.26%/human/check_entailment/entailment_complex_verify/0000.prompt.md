You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

    #This is printed: the elements of the list ans (where the elements were determined by the logic within the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element represents the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that position in the string `s1`. The balance is determined based on the number of '>' characters encountered so far and the number of '<' characters from the end of the string up to that position. The function updates the list `ans` by iterating through the string `s1` from the end to the beginning and performing the necessary calculations. After completing the iteration, the function prints the elements of the list `ans`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly account for the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
3
3
>><
```

#### Expected Output
For the pinball placed on the 1st cell:
- The pinball starts at position 1, moves right to position 2, and then left to position 3, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- The sequence of positions is: 1 -> 2 -> 3.
- The output should be: `3`.

For the pinball placed on the 2nd cell:
- The pinball starts at position 2, moves left to position 1, and then right to position 3, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- The sequence of positions is: 2 -> 1 -> 3.
- The output should be: `3`.

For the pinball placed on the 3rd cell:
- The pinball starts at position 3, moves left to position 2, and then right to position 1, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- The sequence of positions is: 3 -> 2 -> 1.
- The output should be: `3`.

#### Actual Output
Running the provided code with the input `>><`, the output is:
```
3 3 3 
```

This is incorrect because the pinball placed on the 2nd cell should take 3 seconds to leave the grid, but the code incorrectly calculates the time as 3 seconds for all positions.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is **Incorrect**.
