Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Since the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, and `oneInd` are not affected by this line of code, they remain the same. The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
