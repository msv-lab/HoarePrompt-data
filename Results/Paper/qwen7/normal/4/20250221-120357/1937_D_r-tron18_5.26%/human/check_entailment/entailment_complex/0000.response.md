Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function is supposed to compute a value based on the last character of the array `arr` and another character at a specific index. However, the formula `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]` is incorrect because `arr[-1]` refers to the last element of `arr`, but the subtraction part seems to be misinterpreted. The function should ideally return a value related to the balance of characters, but the current implementation does not align with the expected logic.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: This function aims to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The function uses prefix sums and suffix sums to keep track of the balance of '>' and '<' characters. However, the use of `func_1` within `func_2` is problematic because `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, leading to potential errors in the final result.

3. **Overall Program Logic**: The overall logic of the program seems to be attempting to solve the problem correctly by maintaining prefix and suffix sums to track the balance of characters. However, the incorrect implementation of `func_1` will propagate errors throughout the calculation, leading to incorrect results.

Given these observations, the program's core logic is flawed due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, which affects the correctness of the entire program.

Correctness: **False**
