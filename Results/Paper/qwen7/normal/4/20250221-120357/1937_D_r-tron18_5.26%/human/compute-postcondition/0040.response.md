Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated as follows:
- If `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and is greater than `ol`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.
