Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-1] + i + 1 + suffZero[-2]]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` assigns the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` to the variable `oneInd`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `oneInd` now holds the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
