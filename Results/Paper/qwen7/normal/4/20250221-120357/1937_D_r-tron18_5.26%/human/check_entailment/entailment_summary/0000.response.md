Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_2` accurately calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query. Let's break down the logic of `func_2` and compare it with the problem statement:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is a list of positions where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
   - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with 0.
   - `ans` is a list of zeros with length `n`.

2. **Iterating from the end of the string**:
   - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
     - If the character at `i` is '>', calculate the balance of '>' and '<' characters.
     - Update `totalOne` and `preOne` accordingly.
     - If the character at `i` is '<', update `suffZero` and recalculate the balance.

3. **Calculating the balance**:
   - The balance calculation involves determining the number of '>' characters before the current position and the number of '<' characters after the current position.
   - The formula used in the code seems to correctly account for these balances and adjust the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

Given the detailed execution summary and the problem requirements, the logic in `func_2` appears to correctly implement the rules for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid. The function iterates through the string from the end to the beginning, updating the necessary variables and calculating the time for each position.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
