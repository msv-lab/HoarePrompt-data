Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` with two different arguments. The values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `zeroInd` is determined by the function calls but its exact value depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
