Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `M` is the same list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `M`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 1 and `L` being a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer remains unchanged. After executing the code, `M` is also the same list of integers obtained from the input.
