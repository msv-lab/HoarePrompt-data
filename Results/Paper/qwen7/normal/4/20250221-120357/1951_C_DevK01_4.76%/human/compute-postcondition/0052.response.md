Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in list `N`, `w` is the last element of list `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `N` remain unchanged. The length of `N` is now reduced by one, but since `n` was defined as the number of elements in `N` before the pop operation, it remains the same. The value of `w` is the element that was popped from `N`.
