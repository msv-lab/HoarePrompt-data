Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code sets `m` to be the minimum value between `m` and `k`. Since `m` was initially the second element of `L` and `k` was the third element of `L`, `m` is now updated to be the smaller of these two values. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
