Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.
