The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, all the variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in list `N`, the cost is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `w` is the last element of list `N` before popping, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`.**
