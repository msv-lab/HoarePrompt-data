The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, all the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is the original cost plus `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m)`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
