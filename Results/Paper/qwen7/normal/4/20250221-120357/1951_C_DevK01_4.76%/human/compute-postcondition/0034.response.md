Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`**, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.

Explanation: The code calculates `mu` as `k - (n - 1) * m`. Here, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, and `k` is the third element of `L`. Since `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is the smaller of the second and third elements. `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`. The value of `mu` is updated, but no other variables are affected.
