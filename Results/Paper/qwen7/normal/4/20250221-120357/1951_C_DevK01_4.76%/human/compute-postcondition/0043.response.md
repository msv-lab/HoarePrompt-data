Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, and then converts each string into an integer. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `L`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
