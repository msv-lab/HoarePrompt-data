Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the final value of `t` provided as input. For each iteration, `n` will be the length of the list `N`, which contains the first `q` elements of `M` after sorting. `m` will be the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`. `k` will be the third element of `L`. `q` will be the ceiling value of `k / m`. `N` will be a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` after sorting. `cost` will be calculated based on the conditions given: if `n * m == k`, then `cost` will be `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `cost` will be `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the last element of `N` before it is popped. The program will print the `cost` for each iteration and continue to the next one until all iterations are completed.
