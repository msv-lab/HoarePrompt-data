Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.
- `removed_count` is greater than 0.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

This statement will print the string `'MAYBE'` regardless of the values of `favorite_count`, `favorite_value`, `k`, or `removed_count`.

Output: **MAYBE**
