Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
   - `i` is equal to `k`.
   - `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`.
   - If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `removed_count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the range parameter, if `t` is greater than 0, the loop will continue.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k`, `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, and `t` is decremented by 1**.
