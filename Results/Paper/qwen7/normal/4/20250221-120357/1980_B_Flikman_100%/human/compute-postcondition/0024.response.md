Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `k-1`, where `k` is greater than 0.
- `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `i`.
- `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `i`.
- The condition `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count` holds true.

Given this information, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
