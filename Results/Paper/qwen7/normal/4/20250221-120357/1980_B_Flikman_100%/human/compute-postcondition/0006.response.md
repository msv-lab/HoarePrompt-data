Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 to 1000), `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `sorted_a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers in descending order, `removed_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count = 0` initializes the variable `removed_count` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables and their states, along with the new state of `removed_count`.
