Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `k-1`, and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, `i` is a positive integer.
- `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `i`.
- `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `i`. Given that `removed_count` is currently 0, it means `favorite_value` has not been removed from the list up to index `i`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string 'NO' directly without any reference to the variables `favorite_count`, `i`, or `k`.

Output: **NO**
