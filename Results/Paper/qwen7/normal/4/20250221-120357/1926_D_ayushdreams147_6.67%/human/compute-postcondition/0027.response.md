Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`, denoted as `res`. During its execution, it transforms each unique element in `a` using the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and stores these transformed values in a dictionary `count`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` is decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.**
