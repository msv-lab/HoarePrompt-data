#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be equal to the number of unique elements in the list `a`, and `count` will contain entries for each unique element in `a` transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a', denoted as 'res'. Each unique element in 'a' is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary 'count'. If an element appears more than once in 'a', its corresponding entry in 'count' will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`, denoted as `res`. During its execution, it transforms each unique element in `a` using the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and stores these transformed values in a dictionary `count`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` is decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
