Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `count[num]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count[num] -= 1` decreases the value of `count[num]` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
