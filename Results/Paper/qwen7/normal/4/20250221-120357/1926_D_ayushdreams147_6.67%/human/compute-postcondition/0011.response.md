Postcondition: `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `res` is incremented by 1, and either `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 or `count[num]` is decremented by 1 depending on whether `num` is already in `count` or not.
