Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`. If `c` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
