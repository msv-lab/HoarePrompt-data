Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, and `x` is an integer. If the value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `c` is increased by 1, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`. If the value of `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, the values of `c`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `ind` remain unchanged.
