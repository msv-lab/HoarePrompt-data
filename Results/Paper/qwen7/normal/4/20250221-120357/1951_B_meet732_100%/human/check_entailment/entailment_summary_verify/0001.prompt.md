You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of distinct integers `a` and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where `a` represents the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It identifies indices in the list where the value is greater than the `k-th` element of `a` and stores these indices in a list `ind`. Based on the size and content of `ind`, the function returns one of the following values:
- `n - 1` if `ind` is empty.
- `k - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index and that index is 0.
- `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index, that index is greater than `k`, and is not 0.
- The maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains exactly one index, that index is less than or equal to `k`, and is not 0.
- The minimum of the second smallest index in `ind` minus 1 and `k - 1` if `ind` contains more than one index and starts with 0.
- The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `ind` contains more than one index and does not start with 0.
- The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` if `ind` contains more than one index and does not start with 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of matches the cow at position `k` can win. We can achieve this by potentially swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow to improve its chances of winning.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the number of cows `n` and the index `k` of the cow we care about.
   - The cow's ratings are stored in the list `l`, and `k` is adjusted to be zero-indexed.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of ratings `a`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function identifies the rating of the cow at position `k` (`x`).
   - It then iterates through the list to find the positions of the two highest-rated cows that are greater than `x`.
   - Based on these positions, the function calculates the maximum number of matches the cow at position `k` can win.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - If there are no cows with a higher rating than `x`, the cow can theoretically win all remaining matches (`n - 1`).
   - If there is only one such cow, the logic checks if the cow at position `0` is higher than `x` and adjusts the count accordingly.
   - If there are two such cows, the function considers the best position to swap and calculates the maximum possible wins.

5. **Testing the Function**:
   - The function handles various scenarios, including when the cow at position `k` is already in a favorable position or needs to be swapped to a better position.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of wins for the specified cow.
