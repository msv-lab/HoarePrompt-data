Output State: **`c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is not nested within any loops or conditionals, it simply exits the context it was last in. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 2, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`.
