Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the specified cow. The main issues lie in how the function `func_1` processes the list of ratings and determines the maximum number of wins. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Identifying Winning Matches**: The function should identify the positions where the cow can potentially win. This means finding the positions of cows with higher ratings than the specified cow's rating. However, the current implementation only checks up to two such positions, which is insufficient for determining the maximum number of wins.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles some edge cases incorrectly. For example, when there are no cows with higher ratings, it returns `n - 1`, which is incorrect because the cow cannot win any matches if it has the highest rating.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Multiple Winning Positions**: The logic for handling multiple winning positions is flawed. The function should consider all positions where the cow can win, not just the first two.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The problem allows for swapping the cow's position with another cow to maximize the number of wins. The current implementation does not account for this possibility.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
