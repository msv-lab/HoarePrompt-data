Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `c` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`. Since there is no else part, these are the only conditions that apply. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are currently in. However, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `x`, `c`, and `ind` remain unchanged from their previous states. The postcondition remains the same, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional structure.
