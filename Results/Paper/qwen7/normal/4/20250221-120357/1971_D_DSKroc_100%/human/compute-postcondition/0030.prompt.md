Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is 0, `flag` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
        count += 1
    if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
        flag = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `count` remains 1, and `len(s)` must be at least 2. If the first two characters of `s` are not equal when converted to integers, then `count` is set to 1. If they are equal, `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `count` is 2, if the digit at index `i` in string `s` is less than the digit at index `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to 1. If the digit at index `i` is not less than the digit at index `i + 1`, the value of `flag` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `count` is either 3 or 4, `flag` is unchanged. If the digit at position `s[i]` is less than the digit at position `s[i + 1]`, `count` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
