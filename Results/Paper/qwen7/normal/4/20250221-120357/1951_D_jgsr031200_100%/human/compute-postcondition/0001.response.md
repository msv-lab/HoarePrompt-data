Output: **YES**

Explanation: Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18` and `n` is equal to `k`, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string 'YES'. Since no specific values for `n` and `k` are provided other than they are equal, the condition `n == k` is satisfied, and thus the print statement outputs 'YES'.
