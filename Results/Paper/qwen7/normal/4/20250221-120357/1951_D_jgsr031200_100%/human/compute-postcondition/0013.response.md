Output State: **`i` is \(n - k + 1\), `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is \(n - k + 1\) and the second element is 1, `curr` is \(n // (n - k + 1)\)**

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` assigns the value of `n // i` to the variable `curr`. Given that `i` is \(n - k + 1\), the value of `curr` becomes `n // (n - k + 1)`. The values of `i` and `costs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
