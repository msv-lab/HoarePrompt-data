Output State: `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\), `n` is 0, `i` is the last element of `costs` which is 1, and `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. Initially, `costs` contains `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- In the first iteration, `i` is \(n - k + 1\). We compute `curr` as \(n // (n - k + 1)\) and update `h` and `n` accordingly.
- In the second iteration, `i` is 1. We compute `curr` as \(n // 1 = n\) and update `h` and `n` again.
- In the third iteration, `i` is 1 again, but since `n` has been reduced to 0, `curr` will be 0, and no further changes to `h` or `n` occur.
- This process continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
- The value of `h` accumulates the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\) because `curr` in each iteration is effectively the integer division of `n` by the current `i` in `costs`.
- Since `n` is completely consumed, its final value is 0.
- The variable `i` takes on the value of the last element in `costs`, which is 1.
- The list `costs` is updated to reflect the fact that the first element (which was \(n - k + 1\)) has been fully processed, so it is set to 0, and the second element remains 1.
