Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires setting up stalls and pricing them such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` equals `k`, it correctly prints "YES", 1, and 1, then returns `k`.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it correctly prints "NO".
   - For other cases, the logic is flawed:
     - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It calculates `curr` as `n // i` and updates `h` and `n` accordingly.
     - It checks if `h` is less than `k` and prints "NO" if true.
     - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES", 2, and the `costs` list, which is incorrectly set to `[0, 1]`.

3. **Execution Summary Issues**:
   - The execution summary mentions that the function prints "YES", 2, and the `costs` list, which is `[0, 1]`. However, the actual implementation sets `costs` to `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is incorrect.
   - The logic to calculate the number of stalls and their prices is not implemented correctly.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The function should dynamically adjust the prices of the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The current implementation does not handle the dynamic adjustment of prices correctly.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
