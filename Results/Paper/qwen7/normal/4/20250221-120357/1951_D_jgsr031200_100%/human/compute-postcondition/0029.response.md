Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines `n` as 0.
- `i` is defined as 1.
- `costs` is a list containing [0, 1].
- The value of `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\). Given that `n` is 0, this formula simplifies to the sum of all integers from 1 to \(0 - k + 1\), which is impossible since \(k\) is not defined and the range would be invalid. However, the value of `h` is not needed to determine the output of the `print('YES')` statement.
- The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES' to the console, regardless of the values of other variables.
