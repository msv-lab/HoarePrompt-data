Reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case when `n == k`. It prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Case When `n < k`**: The program correctly identifies this scenario and prints "NO". This is the correct behavior because Alice cannot buy any jewels if she has fewer coins than required.

3. **General Case When `n >= k`**:
   - The program calculates the sum of integers from 1 to `n - k + 1` and stores these values in the `costs` list.
   - It then checks if the sum of these values is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO".
   - If the sum is at least `k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[0, 1]`. However, this logic is flawed because setting up stalls with prices `[0, 1]` does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it should set up stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Stall Pricing**:
   - The correct approach would be to set up stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This way, Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and the remaining `k-1` jewels from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when `n >= k`.

Correctness: **False**
