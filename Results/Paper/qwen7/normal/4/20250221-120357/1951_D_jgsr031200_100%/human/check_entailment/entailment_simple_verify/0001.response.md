### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall, buying as many jewels as possible until she runs out of coins or there are no more stalls.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins, by setting the price of the single stall to `1`.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This handles the case where Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost array `costs` where `costs[0] = n - k + 1` and `costs[1] = 1`. These values are chosen to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - It then checks if the sum of the quantities Alice can buy from these stalls (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO".
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES", `2`, and the `costs` array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - However, the logic for calculating the `costs` array and checking the sum `h` is flawed. Specifically, the `costs` array is not correctly set up to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Instead, the program incorrectly assumes that setting `costs[0] = n - k + 1` and `costs[1] = 1` will always work.
   - The loop in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall. The variable `h` accumulates the sum of all integers from `1` to `n - k + 1`, but this does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program would set `costs` to `[8, 1]`, but Alice would buy 8 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 9 jewels, not 3.
   - The check `if h < k` is also incorrect because it does not correctly account for the greedy nature of Alice's purchases.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The `costs` array and the sum `h` are not correctly calculated to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
