Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in costs:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is \(n - k + 1\)
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is \(n - k + 1\) and the second element is 1.
   - `h` is \(\frac{n}{n - k + 1}\)
   - `n` is \(n - (n - k + 1) * curr\)

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `costs` list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken one value from the `costs` list.
   - Since `costs` is a list with two elements, after taking the first element, the next value `i` will take is the second element of the list, which is 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will now be 1.
   - `costs` will now be a list with one element remaining, which is 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `costs` is a list containing one element 1**
