Output State: **`i` is \(n - k + 1\), `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is \(n - k + 1\) and the second element is 1, `h` is \(\frac{n}{n - k + 1}\)**.

Explanation: The code `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the current value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is equal to `n // (n - k + 1)`, `h` is updated to `h + (n // (n - k + 1))`. The values of `i` and `costs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
