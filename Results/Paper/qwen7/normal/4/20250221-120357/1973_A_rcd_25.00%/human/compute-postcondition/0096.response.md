Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains as `low` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented to `low + 1`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `high` and `cur`.
   - For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `high` is already defined as the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `cur` needs to be adjusted such that `high >= cur` holds true.

Given that `cur` is incremented to `low + 1` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is false, we need to ensure that `cur` is less than or equal to `high` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cur` such that `cur` is less than or equal to `high`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`**.
