Let's analyze the given loop and the conditions step by step:

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while high >= cur:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables Involved in the Loop Head
- `high`
- `cur`

### Initial States
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the opposite of `low`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`.

### Analysis
- The loop will execute as long as `high >= cur`.
- We need to ensure that `high >= cur` is true at the start of the loop.

### Determining the Necessary Adjustments
- `high` is defined as the opposite of `low`.
- `low` is determined based on the comparison between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`.

To ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to make sure that `high >= cur` is true. Since `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `cur` is `low`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given that `high` and `cur` are derived from the same logic (one being the opposite of the other), the key is to ensure that the relationship between `high` and `cur` holds true based on the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only rely on the logical relationship established by the definitions of `low`, `high`, and `cur`.

### Conclusion
No specific adjustments are needed to the states of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` because the relationship between `high` and `cur` is already defined by the logic provided. The only thing we need to ensure is that the loop condition `high >= cur` is met, which is inherently true based on the definitions given.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` is equal to `low`**
