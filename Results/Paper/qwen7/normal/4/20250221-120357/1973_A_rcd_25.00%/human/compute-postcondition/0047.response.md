Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues the loop. If the sum is even, the program does not perform any additional operations related to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
