### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the given program, which are indeed correct. Let's reiterate and expand on these points:

1. **Incorrect Initial Check:**
   - The initial check `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is insufficient. It only checks a specific edge case and does not ensure the overall consistency of the scores. For example, the scores `1, 1, 10` are inconsistent but the program incorrectly prints `2` instead of `-1`.

2. **Complex Logic for Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):` might not always hold true for valid configurations of games and draws. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the scores are inconsistent but should return `-1`. For example, the scores `1, 1, 10` are inconsistent because they cannot be achieved through any combination of wins and draws.

Given the corrected approach provided in the original assessment, let's verify the logic:

1. **Ensure Total Points are Even:**
   - The total points must be even, as each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players.

2. **Check Consistency:**
   - The scores must satisfy the condition `p3 <= p1 + p2`. If not, the scores are inconsistent, and the program should print `-1`.

3. **Calculate Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - Calculate the total number of games played, which is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - Iterate over possible numbers of draws and check if the scores can be achieved with those draws.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment handles these points correctly. Here is the corrected version again for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if the scores are consistent
        if p3 > p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        total_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        max_draws = 0
        for d in range(total_games + 1):
            w = total_games - d
            if p1 >= w and p2 >= w and p3 >= w + d:
                max_draws = d
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the scores are consistent and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the given program and provided a corrected version that addresses these issues. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
