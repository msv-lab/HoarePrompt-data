Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and the program continues the loop or block of code if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues the loop or block of code as usual. Otherwise, the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `cur` is `high + 1`.
