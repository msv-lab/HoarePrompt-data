Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 1 10
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program prints `2`, which seems correct at first glance. However, let's analyze the logic:

The program checks if the total sum of scores is even. If it is not, it prints `-1`. This part is correct. For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is `12`, which is even, so this check passes.

Next, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If it is, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is `2`. However, this is incorrect because the maximum number of draws cannot be determined solely by this condition.

To find the correct maximum number of draws, we need to consider the distribution of wins and draws. Given the scores `1, 1, 10`, the only way to achieve these scores is through a combination of wins and draws. The correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of wins and draws to maximize the number of draws.

A more accurate solution would involve iterating over possible values of draws and calculating the remaining points from wins, ensuring the constraints are met. The current implementation does not account for all valid distributions of wins and draws, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
