Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and we continue the loop or block of code.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no change in the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and the statement only affects the control flow by continuing the loop, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
