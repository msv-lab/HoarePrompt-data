Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `low` and `high` values based on the differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions for the loop continue to apply based on the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd.
