Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`, and `cur` must be less than `high`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `low`, `high`, and `cur` also remain valid as per the initial state.
