Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` equals `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will eventually reach the value of `high` because the loop continues to increment `cur` until `high < cur`. The loop breaks when the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, but since `cur` keeps increasing until it reaches `high`, the loop will continue to run until `cur` surpasses `high`. At that point, the loop exits, and the final value of `cur` will be `high`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged from their initial or last updated states within the loop.
