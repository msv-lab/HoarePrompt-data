Output State: **`a` is not an empty list and the last element of `a` is not zero**

Explanation: The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specified that the last element of `a` was zero, after calling `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` is no longer zero. The list `a` remains non-empty as per the initial condition.
