Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `a` will be a list with all its elements shifted one position to the right compared to the original list, assuming the loop continues until `a` becomes empty or no more leading zeros are present in the list.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain the same elements as it originally did, but with all leading zeros removed, and all remaining elements shifted to the beginning of the list. If there were no zeros in the original list, `a` would remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is not empty and `a[-1]` is not 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is not empty and `a[-1]` is not 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is not empty and `a[-1]` is not 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
