Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a` is a list without its last two elements, and the last element of `a` was zero.

Explanation: Given that the loop removes the last element of the list `a` each time it runs and continues as long as the first element is zero, after three iterations, the list `a` will have had its last two elements removed. Since the loop stopped after the third iteration, it means the first element of the list (now shorter by two elements) is no longer zero. Therefore, the final state of `a` is a list that has been shortened by two elements from its original state, and the last element of this shortened list is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with its last three elements removed, and the first element of `a` is not zero, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`) is 0, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list with its last three elements removed, the first element of `a` is not zero, `i` is 4, and `res` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list with its last three elements removed, the first element of `a` is not zero, and `i` is 5. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
