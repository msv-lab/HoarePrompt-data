Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and we have read the value of `t` from input.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000` remains valid after the code is executed. Additionally, we now know the specific value of `t` that was input by the user.
