Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, and the length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7, and the last element of `a` is 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will be a non-empty list where the first element is the second element of the original list, and the list will be at most 7 elements shorter than the original list. Additionally, the last element of `a` will be 0, indicating that the loop continued to remove elements from the end of the list as long as the last element was 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is at least 1 and less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7, and the last element of `a` is 0. If `a[i]` equals 0, then `res` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is at least 1 and less than or equal to the length of the original list minus 7, the last element of `a` is 0, `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, the length of `a` remains the same, the first element of `a` remains the same, the last element of `a` is 0, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` was 0 in the previous iteration and `a[i]` is not 0, or `res` remains the same if `a[i]` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
