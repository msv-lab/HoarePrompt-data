State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). However, since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, we only need to ensure `t` is positive.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring `t` is greater than 0.
