Output State: `a` is a list without its last two elements, and the last element of `a` was zero.

Explanation: Given that the loop removes the last element of the list `a` each time it runs and continues as long as the first element is zero, after three iterations, the list `a` will have had its last two elements removed. Since the loop stopped after the third iteration, it means the first element of the list (now shorter by two elements) is no longer zero. Therefore, the final state of `a` is a list that has been shortened by two elements from its original state, and the last element of this shortened list is not zero.
