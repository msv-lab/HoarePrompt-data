Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is set to `t - 1` in the initial state. The code snippet assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. Since the value of `t` was already determined before the code snippet, it remains `t - 1`. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from user input.
