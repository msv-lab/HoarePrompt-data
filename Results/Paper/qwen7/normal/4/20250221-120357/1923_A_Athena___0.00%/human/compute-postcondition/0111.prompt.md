Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and we have read the value of `t` from input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    print(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` has had all its leading zeros removed, and the remaining elements are shifted to the beginning of the list. If the list originally did not have any leading zeros, it remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with its last five elements removed, and the first element of `a` is not zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its first element set to the second element of the original list, the length of `a` is at most the length of the original list minus 7, and the last element of `a` is 0. `res` is incremented by 1 each time an element in `a` is 0 during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
