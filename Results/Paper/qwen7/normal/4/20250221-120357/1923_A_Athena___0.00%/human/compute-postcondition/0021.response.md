Based on the initial state described, the list `a` will have all its leading zeros removed and the remaining elements will be shifted to the beginning of the list. If the list originally didn't have any leading zeros, it will remain unchanged.

Given this, the `print(a)` statement will simply output the list `a` in its final state, which is the same as its state after all leading zeros have been removed.

Output: **the list a with all leading zeros removed and elements shifted to the beginning**
