Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a` initially had its first element set to 0, after executing the code, the first element is removed, making `a` a non-empty list of integers without its first element.
