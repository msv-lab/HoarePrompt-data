Output State: **`k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The value of `k` is reduced by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which was already part of the initial state. The other variables (`i` and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
