Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and either `r` is set to 0 or `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`. Specifically, if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
