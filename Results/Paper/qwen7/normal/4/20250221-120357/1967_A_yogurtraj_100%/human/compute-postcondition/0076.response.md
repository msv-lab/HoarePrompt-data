Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or remains unchanged.
   - `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false; otherwise, `r` is equal to `a[i]`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or remains unchanged, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false; otherwise, `r` is equal to `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of the loop head variables, the final answer should focus on `i` and `n`:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**.
