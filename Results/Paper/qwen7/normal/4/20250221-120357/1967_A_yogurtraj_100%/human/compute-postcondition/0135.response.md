Let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `y` is defined as `n - 1`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - First, let's find the value of `r`:
     \[
     r = a[n - 1] + k // n
     \]
     Given `k` is 0, this simplifies to:
     \[
     r = a[n - 1] + 0 // n = a[n - 1]
     \]
     So, `r` is simply the last element of the list `a`.

4. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - Substitute `r = a[n - 1]` into the expression:
     \[
     (r - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n = (a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 \% n
     \]
     Since `k` is 0, `k % n` is also 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1
     \]

5. **Final Value:**
   - The final value to be printed is \((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1\).

Given the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1**
