Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`**.

In this output state, the value of `i` remains 2 as it was not modified in the given code snippet. The variable `k` is not mentioned in the operation, so its value remains unchanged. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[2] + k // 3`. Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` refers to the third element of the list `a` (assuming `a` is a list). The division `k // 3` means integer division of `k` by 3.
