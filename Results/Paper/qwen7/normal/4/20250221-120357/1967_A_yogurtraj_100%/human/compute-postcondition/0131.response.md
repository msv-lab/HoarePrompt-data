Postcondition: `i` is 0, `k` is either 0 or `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - (a[1] - a[0])`, `rem` is 0, `r` is either `a[2]` or `a[1]`, `y` is `n - 4`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which is 1 * (a[1] - a[0]), and `r` is set to `a[1]`.
