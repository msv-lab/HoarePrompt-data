Output State: **All variables are unchanged from their final values after the third iteration.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of all variables (`i`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`) remain the same as they were after the third iteration. Specifically, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is either `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` was not 0, or `a[1]` if `k` was 0, and `y` is `n - 1`.
