You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: All variables are unchanged from their final values after the third iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through it to find the maximum value `r` that can be achieved by redistributing up to `k` units among the elements of `a`. Depending on the remaining value of `k` after redistribution, it calculates and prints the final result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` after buying up to `k` additional cards. The key is to strategically use the `k` coins to increase the count of the least frequent card type to help form more valid subarrays.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the initial counts of each card type.
   - It sorts the list `a` to facilitate the calculation.
   - The variable `r` is used to track the highest value of the card type that can be achieved with the remaining budget `k`.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list to determine how many cards of the next type can be bought with the remaining budget.
   - If the remaining budget cannot buy enough cards to increase the count of the current card type, it calculates the new `r` and updates the remaining budget and the count of the last type of card that can be increased.
   - After the loop, if there is still remaining budget, it adjusts `r` and calculates the result using the formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for determining the highest card type `r` and the remaining budget is generally correct.
   - The approach of buying additional cards to increase the count of the least frequent card type is sound.
   - The final calculation of the result seems to correctly account for the remaining budget and the count of the last type of card that can be increased.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the remaining budget cannot buy enough cards to increase the count of the current card type.
   - It also handles the case where there is still remaining budget after the loop.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the score according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
