Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the expression ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) is greater than `k`; `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` is 1. Any number divided by 1 gives a remainder of 0. Therefore, `rem` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
