Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` is decreased by the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, which simplifies to `k -= 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The conditions and values of `n` and `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` being less than or equal to `k` remain valid as they were not directly affected by the code.
