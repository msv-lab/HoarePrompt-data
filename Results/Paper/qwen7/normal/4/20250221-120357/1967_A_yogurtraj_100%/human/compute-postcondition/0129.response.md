Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - (a[1] - a[0])`, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[1]`, `y` is `n - 4`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` which is 1 * (a[1] - a[0])**.

Explanation: The code `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of `a[1]` to `r`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which is `1 * (a[1] - a[0])`, from its current value. All other variables (`rem`, `r`, `y`, and `k`) are updated accordingly, while `i` remains unchanged.
