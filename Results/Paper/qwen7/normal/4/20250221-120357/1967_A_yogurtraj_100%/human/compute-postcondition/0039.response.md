Output State: **i is 3, r is either a[4] or a[3] + 0 depending on the conditions, k is 0, rem is 0, y is n - 1 - 3, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`. In the last iteration, `i` becomes `3` (assuming `n` is 5). At this point, the loop breaks due to the `break` statement inside the `if` condition. Therefore, `r` will be set to `a[4]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was not met, or it will be `a[3] + 0` if the condition was met. The variable `k` is set to `0` when the loop breaks, and `rem` remains `0`. The variable `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`, which in this case is `n - 1 - 3`. All other variables' states remain as they were initialized or updated within the loop body.
