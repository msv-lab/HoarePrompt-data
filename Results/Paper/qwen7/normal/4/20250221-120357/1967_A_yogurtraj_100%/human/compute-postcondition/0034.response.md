Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 1 - 3`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within the scope of the `break` statement, their initial values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all variables and mentions that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
