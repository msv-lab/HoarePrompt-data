Output State: **`k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is equal to `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables `k`, `rem`, `r`, `i`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the break statement indicates that we have exited the loop or conditional block.
