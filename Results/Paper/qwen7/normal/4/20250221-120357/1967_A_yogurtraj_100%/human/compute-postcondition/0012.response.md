Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `y` is `-1`, `k` is `0`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i`, `n`, `y`, `r`, and `rem` are updated based on the new value of `k`. Since `k` was used in the expressions for `r` and `rem`, these values are recalculated. Given the initial conditions, `y` is `n - 2`, which becomes `-1` when `n` is greater than 0. The values of `r` and `rem` are updated to reflect the new value of `k`.
