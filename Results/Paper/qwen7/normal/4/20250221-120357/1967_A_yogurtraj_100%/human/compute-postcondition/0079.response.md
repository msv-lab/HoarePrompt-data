Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `r` is equal to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)'; `rem` is equal to `k % (i + 1)'; `y` is equal to `n - 1 - i`.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1, `r` remains as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` remains as `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is now calculated as `n - 1 - i`.
