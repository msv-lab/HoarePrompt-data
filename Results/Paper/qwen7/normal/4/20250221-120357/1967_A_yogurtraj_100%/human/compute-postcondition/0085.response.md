Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, then `r` is equal to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is equal to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, then `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `r` being updated to `a[i + 1]`.
