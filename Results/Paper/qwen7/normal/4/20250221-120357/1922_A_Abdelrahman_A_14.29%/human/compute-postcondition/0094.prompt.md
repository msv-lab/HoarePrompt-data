Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no` is set to True, `tests` must be greater than the length of the original `c` + 1, `i` is equal to the length of the original `c` + 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the input string, `b` is the value of the input() function, `c` is the value entered by the user through input().
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` will take on the values of the elements in `c`, `c` must contain at least one element, and tests must be greater than `len(c) + 1`. If the current value of `x` is not found in `a` and not found in `b`, the loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer not present in either list `a` or `b`. If `x` is not found in both lists, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an integer not present in either list `a` or `b`, and `no` is False after executing the if statement, assuming `x` meets the condition `x not in a and x not in b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
