Output State: **`no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the length of `c` (reduced by 1) + 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string with one less character, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
