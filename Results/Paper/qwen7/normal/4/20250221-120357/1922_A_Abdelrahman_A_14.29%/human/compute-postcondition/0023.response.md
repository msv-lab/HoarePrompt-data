Postcondition: `c` must contain at least one element, and `x` is an element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `x not in a and x not in b` is not met, then no changes are made to `no`.
