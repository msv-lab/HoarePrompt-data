Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Matching Conditions**: The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient. It should check if both `a` and `b` match some template while `c` does not.

2. **Early Exit**: The program prints 'YES' as soon as it finds a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`. This is incorrect because it should check all characters in `c` before deciding.

3. **Template Validation**: The program does not actually validate if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. It only checks if any single character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Check if a and b have any character that is different from c
        mismatch_a = any(a[i] != c[i] and a[i].islower() for i in range(slength))
        mismatch_b = any(b[i] != c[i] and b[i].islower() for i in range(slength))
        
        # Check if c has any character that is different from a or b
        mismatch_c = any(c[i] != a[i] and c[i].islower() for i in range(slength)) or \
                     any(c[i] != b[i] and c[i].islower() for i in range(slength))
        
        if not (mismatch_a and mismatch_b and not mismatch_c):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for the existence of a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
