To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop head:

The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

- `r > l`: This condition ensures that `r` is greater than `l`.
- `a[r] == a[r - 1]`: This condition checks if the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

Given the current state:
- `le` is the length of list `a`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `l` is equal to `r`.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0.
- `end` is 1.
- `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r`.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `r > l`: Since `l` is equal to `r`, this condition is currently false (`r = r`).
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`: Given that `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r`, and since `l` is equal to `r`, this condition is also false (`a[r] != a[r - 1]`).

To make the loop execute the first time, we need to adjust the state so that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied.

- To satisfy `r > l`, we need to decrease `r` by 1 or increase `l` by 1. Since `l` is already equal to `r`, decreasing `r` by 1 is the most straightforward adjustment.
- To satisfy `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, we need to ensure that the element at index `r - 1` is equal to the element at index `r`. However, since `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r`, and `l` is equal to `r`, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to decrease `r` by 1.

State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `end` is 1, `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r - 1`.**
