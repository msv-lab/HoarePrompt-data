Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `end` is `le`.
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is equal to `r`, and both `r` and `l` are 0.
   - All elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal.
   - `st` is `le - 1`.
   - `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is updated to `le - (le - 1)`, which simplifies to `1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `end` is `le`, and `le` is the length of `a`, `end` is the length of `a`.
   - `st` is `le - 1`, so `st` is the length of `a` minus 1.
   - `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Given that `st` is `le - 1` and `end` is `le`, we have:
     \[
     ans = max(0, le - ((le - 1) + le)) = max(0, le - (2*le - 1)) = max(0, -le + 1)
     \]
     Since `le` is the length of `a` and `a` contains at least one element (because `n > 1`), `-le + 1` will always be negative. Therefore, `max(0, -le + 1)` will be `0`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `ans` is `0`.

Output: **0**
