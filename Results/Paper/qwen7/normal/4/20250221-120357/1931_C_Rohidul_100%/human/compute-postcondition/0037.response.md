Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is updated to the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the new input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**.

Explanation: The line `le = len(a)` updates the variable `le` to the current length of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
