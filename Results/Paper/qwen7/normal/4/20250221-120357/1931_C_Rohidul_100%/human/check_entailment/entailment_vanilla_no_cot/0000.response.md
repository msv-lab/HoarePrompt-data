Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program attempts to handle the merging of segments where elements are the same, but it doesn't fully account for the optimal way to make all elements equal using at most one operation. The logic for determining `st` and `end` does not capture the essence of the problem, which involves finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The formula used to calculate `ans` (which is supposed to represent the minimum cost) is incorrect. The program tries to use the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`, but this does not reflect the actual cost calculation needed for the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire array needs to be changed to a single value, or when the array already has all elements equal.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Identify the different groups of elements in the array.
- Calculate the cost of making all elements in each group equal.
- Use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal with at most one operation.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find unique elements and their positions
        unique_elements = []
        start = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i == n - 1 or a[i] != a[i + 1]:
                unique_elements.append((a[i], start, i + 1))
                start = i + 1
        
        # Calculate the cost to make all elements in each segment equal
        costs = []
        for i in range(len(unique_elements) - 1):
            costs.append(unique_elements[i + 1][1] - unique_elements[i][1])
        
        # Add the cost to make the last segment equal
        costs.append(n - unique_elements[-1][2] + 1)
        
        # Use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost
        dp = [float('inf')] * (len(costs) + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[i - 1])
        
        # The answer is the minimum cost found
        print(dp[-1])

func()
```

This corrected version identifies the segments of the array and calculates the cost to make each segment equal, then uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal with at most one operation.
