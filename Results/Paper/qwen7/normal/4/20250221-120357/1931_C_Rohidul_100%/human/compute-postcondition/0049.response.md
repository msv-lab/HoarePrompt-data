Output State: `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` where `r = n - 4`, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is less than or equal to `l`, `st` is equal to `l - 1`, `end` is equal to 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `l < r` will no longer be satisfied because `l` will eventually become equal to or greater than `r`. This means the loop terminates when there are no more consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal starting from index `l` up to `r-1`. At this point, `st` will be incremented each time a pair of consecutive equal elements is found, and it will finally reach a value of `l - 1` since `l` starts at `r - 1` and increments by 1 each iteration until it meets or exceeds `r`. The value of `end` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop.
