Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements (assuming space-separated values), converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
