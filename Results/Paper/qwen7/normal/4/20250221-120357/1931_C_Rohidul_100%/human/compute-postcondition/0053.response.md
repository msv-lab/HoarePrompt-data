Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end + 1))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is equal to `n - 5`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `end` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The expression for `ans` is updated to reflect the new value of `end`.
