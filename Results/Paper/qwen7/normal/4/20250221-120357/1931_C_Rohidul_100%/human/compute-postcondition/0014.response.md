Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, `st` is 4, `end` is 1, `a[0] == a[1]`, and `a[1] == a[2]`**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given the initial state where `st` is 3, after executing the code, `st` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
