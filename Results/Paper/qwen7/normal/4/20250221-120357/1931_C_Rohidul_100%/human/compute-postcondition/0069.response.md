Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The initial state of `n` being an input integer remains unchanged, but now `a` is a list containing the integer values from the input string.
