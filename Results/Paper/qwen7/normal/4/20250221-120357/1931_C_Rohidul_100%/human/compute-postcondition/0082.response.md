Output State: `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, all elements between `a[l]` and `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le // 2`, `end` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the adjacent elements in the list are equal. Each iteration of the loop increments `l` and increases `st`. After the loop ends, it means that either `l` has reached `r` (making `l == r`), or there are no more consecutive equal elements left in the list. Since the loop increments `st` each time it runs, `st` will be half the length of the list if all elements were equal (or just before the first unequal pair).
