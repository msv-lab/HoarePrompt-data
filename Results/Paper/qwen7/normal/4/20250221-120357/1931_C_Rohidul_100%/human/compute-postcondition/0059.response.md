Output State: **`r` is equal to `n - 7`, `l` is equal to `n - 10`, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1.**

The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. The values of `r`, `l`, and the condition `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
