Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is 3.
   - `r` must be greater than 2.
   - `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`.
   - `st` is 3.
   - `end` is 1.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop head checks two conditions: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

4. **Check Each Condition Separately**:
   - **Condition 1: `l < r`**
     - Currently, `l` is 3.
     - For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than 3 (since `l` is 3).
   - **Condition 2: `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**
     - Currently, `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]` (since `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]` and `l` is 3).
     - This condition is already satisfied.

5. **Adjust the Necessary States**:
   - Since `l` is 3 and `r` must be greater than 2, to satisfy `l < r`, `r` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `r` is greater than 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 3, `end` is 1**
