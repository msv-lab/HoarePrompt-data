Output State: `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `end` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` are equal. Each iteration increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. Once `l` becomes equal to `r`, the condition `l < r` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, all elements from index `l` (which is now equal to `r`) to the end of the list are equal, and `st` will be the count of how many times the loop executed, which is `le - 1` since we start comparing from the first two elements.
