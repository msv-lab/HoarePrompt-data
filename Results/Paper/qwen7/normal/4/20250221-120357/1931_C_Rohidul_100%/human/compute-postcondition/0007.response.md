Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, and `a[0] == a[1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` was initially set to 0 and then incremented by 1 using the statement `l += 1`. Therefore, `l` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
