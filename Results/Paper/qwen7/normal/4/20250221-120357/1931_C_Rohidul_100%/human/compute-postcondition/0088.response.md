Output State: **`end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` must be `n - 2` and greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `r` is now one less than its previous value, while all other conditions and values remain as per the initial state.
