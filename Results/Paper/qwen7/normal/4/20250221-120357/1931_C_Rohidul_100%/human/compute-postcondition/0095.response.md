Output State: **`end` is `le`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is 0, `l` is 0, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `ans` is `le - (le - 1)` which simplifies to `1`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `r` is decremented until it is no longer greater than `l`. Given that `l` is equal to `r` and both start at 0, `r` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is always true since `r - 1` would be -1, and the comparison is effectively checking the first element against itself, which is true.
- The loop increments `st` each iteration, but since `r` never changes from 0, the loop only runs once, setting `st` to `le - 1`.
- After the loop, `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`, which simplifies to `le - (le - 1)`, resulting in `1`.
