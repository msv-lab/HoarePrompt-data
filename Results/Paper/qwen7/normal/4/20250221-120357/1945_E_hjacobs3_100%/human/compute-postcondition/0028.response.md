Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` plus one.**
