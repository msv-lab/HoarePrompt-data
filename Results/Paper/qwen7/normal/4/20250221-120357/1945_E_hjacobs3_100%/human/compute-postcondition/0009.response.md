Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.
   - The loop body sets `l` to `mid` if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, otherwise it sets `r` to `mid`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r - l > 1` must still hold true.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is set to `mid`.
   - If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, `r` is set to `mid`.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - After each iteration, either `l` or `r` is updated based on the value of `array[mid]`.
   - For the loop to continue, the difference `r - l` must remain greater than 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `r - l > 1` holds true after the update.

6. **Consider the possible updates**:
   - If `l` is set to `mid`, then `r - mid > 1` must hold.
   - If `r` is set to `mid`, then `mid - l > 1` must hold.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `r - l > 1` remains true after the update. This means that both `l` and `r` should be such that their difference is greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r` to ensure that `r - l > 1` holds true.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, and `r - l` must be greater than 1**
