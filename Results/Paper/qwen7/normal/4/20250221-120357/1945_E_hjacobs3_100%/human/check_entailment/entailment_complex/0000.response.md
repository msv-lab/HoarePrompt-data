Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required solution. The key issue lies in the logic used to determine the positions of the elements to swap. Specifically, the current implementation only checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `find` and swaps `l` with the index of `find` if they are different. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that `find` might be located at position `r` instead of `l`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Loop**: The binary search loop is implemented correctly, but the logic for determining the final positions to swap is incorrect.
2. **Swapping Logic**: The current logic only checks if `array[l]` is not equal to `find` and swaps `l` with the index of `find`. This does not cover all possible scenarios, especially when `find` could be at position `r` after the loop ends.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the correct positions are swapped to place `find` at the `l` position. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if find is at position l or r
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Swap the element at position l with the element at the index of find
        find_index = array.index(find) + 1
        print(1)
        print(l, find_index)
```

With this corrected function, the program should now correctly identify and swap the necessary elements to place `find` at the `l` position.

Correctness: **False**
