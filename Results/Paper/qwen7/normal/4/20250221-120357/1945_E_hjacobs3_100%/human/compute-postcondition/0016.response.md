Output State: **`mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, and `r` is updated such that `r - l > 1`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `mid` to `(l + r) // 2`. This does not affect the values of `l` and `r` directly, but it ensures that `r` is still such that `r - l > 1` after the assignment. Therefore, the output state maintains the conditions of the initial state with the updated value of `mid`.
