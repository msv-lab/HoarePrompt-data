Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**.

This means that the variable `mid` is now assigned the value of `(l + r) // 2`, while the list `array` and its length `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
