Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation array to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` using at most 2 swaps.
2. The provided code attempts to use binary search to find the position of `x` in the array. However, the implementation of the binary search is flawed because:
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` are set incorrectly (`l = 0` and `r = n`). They should be initialized as `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` as per the problem statement.
   - The binary search logic is also incorrect because it does not correctly update `l` and `r` to narrow down the search range.
3. After identifying the issues with the binary search, the code tries to determine if a swap is needed to place `x` at the correct position. However, the logic to determine the necessary swaps is also flawed. Specifically:
   - The check `if (l != array.index(find)):` is incorrect because `l` might already point to the correct position after the binary search completes.
   - The code only handles one potential swap scenario, but it fails to account for the possibility that two swaps might be needed to correctly position `x`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
