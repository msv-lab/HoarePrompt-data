Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`. It performs a binary search on `array` to locate `find`. If `find` is not equal to the element at index `l`, it prints `1` and returns a list containing the index of `l` plus one and the index of `find` in `array` plus one. Otherwise, it prints `0` and no value is returned. The list `array` remains unchanged after the function executes.**
