Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `r - l > 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`.
   - The difference `r - l` is `n - 0 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` (which is the value of `r`) is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `r` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1**
