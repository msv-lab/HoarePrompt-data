Based on the initial state provided:

- `array` is a permutation of length `n` where `n > 1`.
- `l` and `r` define a subarray of `array` with a length of 1.
- `mid` points to one of the elements in this final subarray, either `array[l]` or `array[r]`.
- `find` is not directly relevant to the final state.
- The current value of `l` is such that `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`, which means it will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
