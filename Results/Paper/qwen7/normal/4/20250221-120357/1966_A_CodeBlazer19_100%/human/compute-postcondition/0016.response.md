Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts, where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not change the state. Otherwise, the program does not change the state.**
