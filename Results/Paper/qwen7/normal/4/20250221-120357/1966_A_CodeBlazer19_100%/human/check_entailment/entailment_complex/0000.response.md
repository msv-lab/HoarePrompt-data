Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.
3. It then reads the list of card values `l`.
4. The program uses a list comprehension to create a list `p` containing the count of each unique value in `l`.
5. It checks if the maximum count in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.
6. If the condition is met, it prints `k - 1`, indicating that we can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1` through the allowed operations.
7. If the condition is not met, it prints `n`, meaning we cannot reduce the number of cards further using the allowed operations.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly determines the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
