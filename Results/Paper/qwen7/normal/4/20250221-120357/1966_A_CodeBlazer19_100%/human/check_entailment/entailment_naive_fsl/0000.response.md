Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the maximum count of any card is less than `k` but there are multiple distinct cards present. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
5 2
3 8 1 48 7
```

According to the problem description, since `k = 2`, we can only exchange groups of 2 cards with another group of 1 card. However, the program checks if the maximum count of any card is greater than or equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` if true. In this case, the maximum count is 1, which is less than `k`. Therefore, the program should print `5` because we cannot perform any exchanges and the minimum number of cards left is the total number of cards.

However, the program incorrectly prints `1` in this case. This is because the program does not account for the scenario where no exchanges can be made and the total number of cards remains unchanged. Thus, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
