Postcondition: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of occurrences of unique elements in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.**
