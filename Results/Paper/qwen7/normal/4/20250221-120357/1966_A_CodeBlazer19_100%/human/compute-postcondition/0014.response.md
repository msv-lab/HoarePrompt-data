Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts, where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

This statement will simply print the value of `k` minus 1. Since the value of `k` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the input. Therefore, the output will be the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an input integer)**
