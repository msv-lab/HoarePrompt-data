Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers created by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `l`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
