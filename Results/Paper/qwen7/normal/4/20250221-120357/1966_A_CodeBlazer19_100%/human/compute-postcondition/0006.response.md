Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of occurrences of unique elements in `l`.
- The maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The `print(k - 1)` statement will simply print the value of `k` minus 1. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only refer to it symbolically.

Output: **k - 1**
