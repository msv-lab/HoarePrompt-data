Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`, `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, and the values of the variables `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and the condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` remain unchanged, these values are carried over to the output state without any modification.
