Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`, `lower` is the result of `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda: arg < l) or 0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `lower` based on the conditions provided. Specifically, `lower` is set to the result of `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. Since `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]` are not directly modified by the code, their values remain the same as before. The values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `upper` are also not directly modified, so they retain their previous states.
