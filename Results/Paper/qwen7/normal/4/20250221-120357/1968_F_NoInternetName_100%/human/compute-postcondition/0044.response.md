Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `q` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, but the function `func_1` and the argument `int` are not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, similar to `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `r` without knowing the function and the argument.
- `upper` is derived from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`, but `inds`, `x`, and `func_3` are not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `upper`.

Given this information, the only part of the code that we can definitively print is the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
