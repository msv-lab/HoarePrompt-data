Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
