Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`. Since no specific function or input is given for `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`.
- `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. Again, without knowing the exact structure of `inds` and `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `upper`.
- `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`. Since `lower` is not defined in the initial state, we can only use the information that `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

Given this information, the print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
