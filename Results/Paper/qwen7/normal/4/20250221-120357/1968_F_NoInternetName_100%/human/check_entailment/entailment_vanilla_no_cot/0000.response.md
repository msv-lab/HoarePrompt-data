Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search Functions**: The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are unnecessary and incorrectly implemented. They do not serve the purpose of finding indices efficiently within the context of the problem. Instead, the problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values, which can be more efficiently handled using prefix XOR and hash maps.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Interesting Subarrays**: The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is flawed. Specifically, the code checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is interesting. It needs to check if there exists a way to partition the subarray such that all parts have the same XOR value.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The code uses binary search to find indices, which is not necessary and complicates the solution. Instead, a simpler approach using prefix XOR and hash maps would suffice.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Using a prefix XOR array to store cumulative XOR values.
- Using a hash map to store the frequency of each XOR value up to the current index.
- For each query, check if there exists a way to partition the subarray such that all parts have the same XOR value.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def is_interesting_subarray(a, l, r):
    prefix_xor = [0] * (len(a) + 1)
    xor_freq = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Compute prefix XOR
    for i in range(1, len(prefix_xor)):
        prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i-1] ^ a[i-1]
    
    # Store frequency of each prefix XOR value
    for i in range(l, r+1):
        xor_freq[prefix_xor[i]] += 1
    
    # Check if there exists a way to partition the subarray
    target_xor = prefix_xor[r] ^ prefix_xor[l-1]
    count = xor_freq[target_xor]
    
    # If the target XOR appears at least twice, it's possible to partition
    return count >= 2

# Function to handle queries
def handle_queries(n, q, a, queries):
    for l, r in queries:
        if is_interesting_subarray(a, l, r):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Main function to read input and process queries
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(q)]
        handle_queries(n, q, a, queries)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version uses a more straightforward approach to determine if a subarray is interesting, leveraging prefix XOR and frequency counting, which aligns with the problem requirements.
