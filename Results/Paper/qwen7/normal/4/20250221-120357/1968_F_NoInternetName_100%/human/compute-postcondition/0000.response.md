Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, and the function `func_1` has been called with an argument of type `int`.**

Explanation: The code `n, q = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an argument of type `int`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `n` and `q`. The values of `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. The function call itself is noted as having occurred.
