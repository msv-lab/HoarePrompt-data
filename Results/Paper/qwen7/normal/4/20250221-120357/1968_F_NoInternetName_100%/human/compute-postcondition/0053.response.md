Output State: **`i` is 3, `q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)` for the last iteration, and `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]` for the last iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to 3 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration), `q` must still be greater than 0 (as it was initially and no changes were made to it within the loop), `l` and `r` will be the values returned by `func_1(int)` for the last iteration of the loop, and `upper` will be the result of the expression `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]` evaluated for the last iteration.
