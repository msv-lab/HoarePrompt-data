Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]**, and we continue the loop.

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
