Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0; `inds[0]` is now a list containing the element 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is a list where the last element is updated to the value of the last element of `x` XORed with `i`; `inds[x[-1]]` now contains the length of `x` - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the value `len(x) - 1`, `i` is the next element in `a`, and `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the value `len(x)`, `i` is the next element in `a`, `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, and `x` has an additional element which is `x[-1] ^ i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
