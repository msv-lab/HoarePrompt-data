Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program uses binary search functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) which are not utilized appropriately for solving the problem. The core issue lies in how the program checks if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search Functions**: The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are not used effectively to solve the problem. These functions are designed for finding elements in a sorted array, but they are not relevant to the XOR-based partitioning problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subarray Interestingness**: The program attempts to use the XOR values stored in the `x` array to determine if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values. However, the logic for checking this condition is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly uses binary search to find indices and then checks these indices without properly ensuring that the subarray can indeed be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 5
  1 1 2 3 0
  1 5
  2 4
  3 5
  1 3
  3 4
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  NO
  NO
  NO
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

This indicates that the program incorrectly identifies the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` as interesting for the first query, which it should not be. The correct approach would involve iterating through the subarray and checking if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values, rather than relying on binary search functions.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting, it fails for at least one input case, making the program incorrect.
