Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`, which ranges from `0` to `q-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Determine the State of `q`:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < q`. Therefore, `q` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider the State of Other Variables:**
   - The other variables `x` and `inds` are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution. They remain as they are.

Based on the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop variable `i` and the loop control variable `q`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0**
