Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`.
- The current value of `upper` is greater than `lower`.

The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'Yes', and there are no variables or objects being referenced within the print statement itself, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **Yes**
