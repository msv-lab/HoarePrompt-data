Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in `L` have been iterated over, `k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, and `pow` is \(2^n\) where \(n\) is the number of iterations the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2^n, where n is the number of times the loop executed.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be reduced by the total sum of all elements in `L`. The variable `tot` accumulates the sum of elements from `L` as the loop progresses. For each iteration, `k` is decreased by the current value of `tot`, then `tot` is updated by adding the next element from `L`. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration, starting from 2. Since the loop breaks when the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is met, the final value of `pow` will be 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, which is equal to the number of elements processed before breaking the loop. Given the information, if the loop executes fully, `pow` will be 2^n, where n is the number of iterations, and `k` will be reduced by the total sum of `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is now decreased by `3 * (tot + a)`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 16, `t` is 1, and `tot` is now greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
