Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * (tot + a)`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 4, `t` is 1, `tot` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, so `pow` changes from 2 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state and the code snippet.
