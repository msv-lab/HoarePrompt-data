Output State: **Postcondition: `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`. `tot` is an integer less than `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the value of `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `L`, `a`, `tot`, or `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Therefore, the postconditions and preconditions remain the same, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional structure.
