Output State: `k` is reduced by the total sum of all elements in `L` multiplied by the number of iterations, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is \(2^t\), where \(t\) is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be reduced by the total sum of all elements in `L` for each iteration, resulting in a reduction of `k` by `t * (tot + a)` where `t` is the total number of iterations. The variable `n` becomes 0 because it is set to 0 in the while loop condition once `n` is fully processed. The variable `m` is no longer relevant since the loop has ended. The variable `pow` will be \(2^t\) where \(t\) is the total number of iterations, as it doubles with each iteration. The variable `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L` because it accumulates the sum of elements from `L` throughout the iterations.
