Output State: All elements in `L` have been iterated over, `k` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `L` multiplied by the number of iterations, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be reduced by the total sum of all elements in `L` for each iteration, making it reduced by the sum of all elements in `L` multiplied by the total number of iterations. The variable `tot` will accumulate the sum of all elements from `L` as the loop progresses. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration, starting from 2, so after `t` iterations, `pow` will be \(2^t\). The variables `n` and `m` will be 0 because the `while` loop inside the `for` loop will terminate when `n` becomes 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the input integer and does not change within the loop.
