Output State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2**

The code `k -= tot` decreases the value of `k` by the value of `tot`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `pow`) remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that `k` was already decreased by `tot`, so this operation updates `k` further. The values of `n`, `m`, and `pow` stay as they were initially.
