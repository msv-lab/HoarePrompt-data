Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `k` is decreased by `tot`. Since `tot` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we know that `k` was originally some value, let's call it `original_k`. After being decreased by `tot`, the new value of `k` is `original_k - tot`.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `L` is a list that must have at least one element, but the specific elements of the list are not relevant to the print statement.

2. The print statement:
   ```python
   print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
   ```

3. Substituting the known values:
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `k` is `original_k - tot`.

4. Calculating the expression inside the print statement:
   - The expression becomes `2 * (2 * (original_k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Simplifying, we get `2 * (2 * original_k - 2 * tot - 1) = 4 * original_k - 4 * tot - 2`.

5. Since we don't have the explicit value of `original_k` and `tot`, we express the final result in terms of these variables.

Output: **4 * original_k - 4 * tot - 2**
