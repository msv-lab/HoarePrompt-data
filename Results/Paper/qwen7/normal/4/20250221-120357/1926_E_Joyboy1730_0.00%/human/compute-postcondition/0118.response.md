Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for a in L:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `L` is not empty and `L` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is decreased by `tot`.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `L` is an empty list that must have at least one element.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `L` is currently an empty list, the loop will not execute because `L` does not contain any elements.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for the variables `a` and `L` since the loop condition is not met.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only relevant variable for the loop condition is `L`. Since `L` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, it cannot remain empty.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `L` now has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 2, `t` is 1; `L` is a list that must have at least one element**.
