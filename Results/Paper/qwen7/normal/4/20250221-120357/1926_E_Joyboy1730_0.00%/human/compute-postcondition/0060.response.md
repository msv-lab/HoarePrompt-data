Output State: `k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is 0, `m` is equal to the last calculated value of `(n + 1) // 2`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. Each iteration reduces `n` by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. After each iteration, `n` becomes smaller until it eventually reaches 0. Once `n` is 0, the condition `while n:` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `n` is 0, and `m` will be the value it had in the last iteration when `n` was just reduced to 0. All other variables (`k` and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states because they are not affected by the loop.
