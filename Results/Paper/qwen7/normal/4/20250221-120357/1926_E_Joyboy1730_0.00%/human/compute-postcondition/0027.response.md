Output State: **`L` must have at least one element, and `a` is the first element in `L`; `tot` is an integer less than `k`, and `k` is now `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. The other variables (`L`, `a`, `tot`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `tot` is an integer less than `k` is updated to reflect that `tot` is increased by the value of `a`. Therefore, `k` is now `k - (tot + a)`.
