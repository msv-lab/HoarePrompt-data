Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where for each test case, it takes three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) as inputs. It checks if \(1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). Based on the values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), it prints either 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything but prints the results directly.**
