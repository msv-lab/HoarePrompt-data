You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, itest equals the total number of iterations (which is the value of t), n, m, and k are integers obtained from the last input split by spaces. The condition checked in the loop is n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k. If the condition was met for any iteration, 'Yes' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives three test cases (t) where for each test case, it takes integers n, m, and k as inputs. For each test case, if 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, it processes these inputs. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions met for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
