Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` is 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces.
- Either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given the conditions for `n`, `m`, and `k`, the value of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` will be compared with `k`. Regardless of the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the print statement will always output `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
