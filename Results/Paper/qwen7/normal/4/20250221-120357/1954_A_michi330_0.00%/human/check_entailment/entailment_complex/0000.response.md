Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color:
     - `n <= k`: If Bob can repaint at most `k` parts and there are `n` parts, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if after Alice paints the ribbon with `m` colors, the maximum number of parts with the same color (`math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color because he can only repaint `k` parts.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'NO' if either of the above conditions is true, indicating that Bob can still make all parts the same color.
   - The program prints 'Yes' if neither of the above conditions is true, indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n <= k` or when `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.
   - The logic ensures that the constraints \(1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) are respected.

Given the analysis, the program logic is correct and matches the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
