Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is equal to `t`, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last set of integers entered during any iteration of the loop. The condition inside the loop (`if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`) is checked for each set of inputs, and based on whether the condition is met or not, 'YES' or 'NO' is printed for each set of inputs. The final state will reflect the last set of values for `n`, `m`, and `k` that were processed, as well as the fact that `itest` has reached the value of `t`.
