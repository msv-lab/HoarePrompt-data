Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
3. The logic inside the loop checks two conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color:
   - `n <= k`: If Bob can repaint at least as many parts as there are parts, he can always make all parts the same color.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if there are enough parts with different colors such that Bob cannot repaint them all to be the same. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `math.ceil(n / m)` times. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than `k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
4. If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
5. The program handles all given examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem statement and correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color.

Correctness: **True**
