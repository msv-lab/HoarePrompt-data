Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` is equal to 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. In such cases, Alice can still ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color by painting all but one part with different colors. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 1 4
```

According to the problem description, the output should be "YES" because Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation will output "NO" because it checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, which fails in this scenario.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to account for the case where `m == 1` and `k >= n - 1`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k or (m == 1 and k >= n - 1):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

This adjustment ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
