Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
