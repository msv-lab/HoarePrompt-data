Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is `x`, `x` and `y` are input integers from each iteration of the loop. The final values of `x` and `y` will depend on the comparison in each iteration, but `t` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` takes the final value of `x` from the last iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are input integers, and their values are printed based on the condition `if x > y: print(x, y) else: print(y, x)`. Therefore, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted during the loop's execution.
