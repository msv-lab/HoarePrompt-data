Reasoning:
- The problem requires outputting the minimum of two numbers followed by the maximum.
- The provided program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, but it does not use this value `t` in the loop that processes the test cases.
- Inside the loop, the program correctly takes two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the larger number followed by the smaller number using an `if-else` statement.
- However, the program's logic is flawed because it always prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, regardless of whether `x` was originally larger or smaller than `y`.
- The correct approach should be to first determine which of `x` and `y` is the minimum and which is the maximum, then print them in the correct order.

Given the above points, the program does not meet the requirement of printing the minimum followed by the maximum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
