Postcondition: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times. Regardless of whether `x[i]` is less than `y[i]` or greater than or equal to `y[i]`, `x[i]` remains less than `y[i]` if it was less, and greater than or equal to `y[i]` if it was greater.**
