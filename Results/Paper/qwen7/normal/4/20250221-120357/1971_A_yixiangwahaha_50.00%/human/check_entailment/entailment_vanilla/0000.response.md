### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the provided code does not read this value. Instead, it assumes there are exactly 10 test cases by using a fixed loop range (`for i in range(10)`). This is incorrect because the actual number of test cases can vary between 1 and 100.

2. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input for all 10 test cases at once, storing them in lists `x` and `y`. However, the problem description indicates that each test case should be processed individually, with multiple lines of input corresponding to different test cases.

3. **Processing Test Cases**: The code processes the pre-read inputs in a loop, but it does not handle the dynamic nature of the number of test cases. It should use a loop based on the value of `t` instead of a fixed range.

4. **Output Format**: The code correctly prints the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers, but it should be done within a loop that iterates `t` times, reading new pairs of integers from the input for each iteration.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
