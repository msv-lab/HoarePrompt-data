Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 10.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is 10.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same (an integer within the range 1 to 100).
   - `x` remains the same (a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`).
   - `y` remains the same (a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`).
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains 10.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is 10**
