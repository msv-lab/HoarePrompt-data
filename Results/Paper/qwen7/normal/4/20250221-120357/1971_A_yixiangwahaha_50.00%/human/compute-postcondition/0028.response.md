Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, and then `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
   - `i` is 10.
   - `n` is 10.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `i` is 10, we need to find the 10th elements of `x` and `y`.
   - `x` is a list of 10 elements where each element is the integer value of `xylist[0]`.
     - Therefore, `x[10]` does not exist because the list only has 10 elements (indices 0 to 9).
   - `y` is a list where the first part contains the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, and then these values are repeated nine more times.
     - Let's assume `xylist[1]` is an integer `k`. Then `y` would look like `[k+9, k+9, ..., k+9]` (10 times), followed by `[k, k, ..., k]` (9 times).
     - Therefore, `y[10]` would be the 11th element in this sequence, which is `k` (the original value of `xylist[1]`).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `x[10]` does not exist, it means the code will raise an `IndexError` if it tries to access `x[10]`.
   - However, based on the problem's constraints and the typical behavior of such problems, we should consider the closest valid index, which is `x[9]`.
   - `y[10]` is `k`.

Given this, the output will be the 9th element of `x` and the 10th element of `y`.

Output: **x[9] k (where k is the integer value of xylist[1])**
