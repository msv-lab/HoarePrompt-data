Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on spaces.**

The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns this list to the variable `xylist`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
