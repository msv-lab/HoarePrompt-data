Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]` and the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]` plus one, `i` is 3, `n` is 10, `xylist` is updated to a list of strings split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to `xylist`. The initial values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The `xylist` variable now holds the split input as a list of strings.
