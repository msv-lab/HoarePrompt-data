Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, and then `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
   - `i` is 10.
   - `n` is 10.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.

2. **Determine the Values of `x` and `y`:**
   - Since `xylist` is a list of strings, let's assume `xylist = ['a', 'b']` for simplicity (the actual values don't matter much for this specific problem).
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` (which is 'a') repeated 10 times. So, if 'a' is converted to an integer, say `a_int`, then `x = [a_int, a_int, ..., a_int]` (10 times).
   - `y` starts with the integer values of `xylist[1]` (which is 'b') each incremented by 9, so if `b_int` is the integer value of 'b', then `y = [b_int + 9, b_int + 9, ..., b_int + 9]` (10 times). Then, `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` (which is 'b') nine more times, so `y = [b_int + 9, b_int + 9, ..., b_int + 9, b_int, b_int, ..., b_int]` (19 times).

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])`.
   - Given `i` is 10, we need to find the 10th element in both `y` and `x`.
   - For `y`, the 10th element is one of the elements that were incremented by 9 and added at the end. Specifically, it is `b_int + 9` because the first 10 elements are `b_int + 9` and the next 9 elements are just `b_int`.
   - For `x`, the 10th element is `a_int` because `x` is a list of `a_int` repeated 10 times.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **b_int + 9 a_int** (where `b_int` is the integer value of `xylist[1]` and `a_int` is the integer value of `xylist[0]`).
