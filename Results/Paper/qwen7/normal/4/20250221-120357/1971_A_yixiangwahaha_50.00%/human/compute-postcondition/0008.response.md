Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(10)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 10.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is 10. Therefore, the loop can execute again because `1 < 10`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop can execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. So, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is 10**.
