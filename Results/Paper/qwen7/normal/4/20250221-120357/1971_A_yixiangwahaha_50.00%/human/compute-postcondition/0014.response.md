Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, the integer value of `xylist[1]`, and the integer value of `xylist[0]` again, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]` plus one, `i` is 3, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` appends the integer value of `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Initially, `x` contains the integer value of `xylist[0]` and the integer value of `xylist[1]`. After appending, `x` will contain these three values: the integer value of `xylist[0]`, the integer value of `xylist[1]`, and the integer value of `xylist[0]` again. All other variables remain unchanged.
