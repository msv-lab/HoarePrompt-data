Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.

This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain the integer value of `xylist[0]` ten times, and the list `y` will contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` ten times, each incremented by its respective index position minus one (since it starts from 1).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 9, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times. If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. If `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times. Regardless of whether `x[i]` is less than `y[i]` or greater than or equal to `y[i]`, `x[i]` remains less than `y[i]` if it was less, and greater than or equal to `y[i]` if it was greater.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
