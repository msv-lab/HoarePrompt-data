State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` is 10**

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(10):` will start with `i` being 0 and increment `i` until it reaches 10.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0 and `n` (the upper limit of the range) must be 10.
- The initial values of `t`, `x`, and `y` do not affect the loop's execution, so they remain as given.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to 10. However, since the loop starts with `i` as 0, we can directly state `i` is 1 to reflect the first iteration of the loop.
