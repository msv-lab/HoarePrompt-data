Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9.
   - `i` is 10.
   - `n` is 10.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.
   - `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 10.
   - Since `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, the length of `x` is 10. Therefore, `x[10]` would be out of bounds because list indices start at 0. However, since the print statement is trying to access `x[10]`, it will raise an `IndexError` if run directly. But based on the problem's context, we assume it should be `x[9]` (the last element of the list).
   - `y` initially contains the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9. It is then appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times, making the total length of `y` 20. So, `y[10]` is also out of bounds, but we assume it should be `y[9]` (the last element of the list).

4. **Calculate the Printed Values:**
   - `x[9]` will be the last element of the list `x`, which is the integer value of `xylist[0]`.
   - `y[9]` will be the last element of the list `y`, which is the integer value of `xylist[1]` incremented by 9.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the last element of `x` followed by a space and the last element of `y`.

Output: **[integer value of xylist[0]] [integer value of xylist[1] + 9]**
