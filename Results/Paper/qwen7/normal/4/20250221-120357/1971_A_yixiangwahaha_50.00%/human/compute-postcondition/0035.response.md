Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.**

**Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will still contain the integer value of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, and the list `y` will contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` repeated 10 times, each incremented by its respective index position minus one (starting from 0). The variable `i` will be 10, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains 10 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop. The list `y` is extended to contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times, making a total of 10 repetitions.
