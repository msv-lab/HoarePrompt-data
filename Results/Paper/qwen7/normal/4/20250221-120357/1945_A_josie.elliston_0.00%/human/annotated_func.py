#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. The function returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to the specified conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: extroverts is a non-negative integer, representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer, representing the number of universals. The function returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to the specified conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them. Additionally, the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is greater than or equal to 3.
    #State: The function returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to the specified conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them. Specifically, if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the minimum number of tents needed. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, but only if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It returns the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the given number of extroverts and universals according to specific conditions, or `None` if it is impossible to accommodate them. Specifically, if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates and returns the minimum number of tents needed. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns introverts plus ret if ret is not None, otherwise it returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `introverts` (a non-negative integer), `extroverts` (a non-negative integer), and `universals` (a non-negative integer). It calls another function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. If `func_1` returns `None`, the function returns `-1`; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1`.
