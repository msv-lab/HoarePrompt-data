Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It returns the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the given number of extroverts and universals according to specific conditions, or `None` if it is impossible to accommodate them. Specifically, if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates and returns the minimum number of tents needed. Otherwise, it returns `None`.**
