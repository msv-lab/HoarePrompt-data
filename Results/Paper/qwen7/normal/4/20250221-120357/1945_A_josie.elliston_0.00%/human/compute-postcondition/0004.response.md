Postcondition: **The function returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to the specified conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them. Specifically, if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the minimum number of tents needed. Otherwise, the function returns None.**
