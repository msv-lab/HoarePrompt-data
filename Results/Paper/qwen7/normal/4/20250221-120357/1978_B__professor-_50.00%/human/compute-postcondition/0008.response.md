Given the initial state, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not used in the expression, so it doesn't affect our calculation.
2. `_` is 1. This value is also not used in the expression.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `a` is an input integer.
5. `b` is an input integer and `b > a`.
6. The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, i.e., \(b - a \geq n\).

The expression to be evaluated is \(\text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)\).

Let's simplify this step-by-step:
- \(2 * b - n + 1\) is an integer expression.
- Multiplying this result by \(n\) and then dividing by 2 results in an integer due to the `int()` function.

Since `b` and `a` are input integers and `b > a` with \(b - a \geq n\), the expression simplifies to a specific form based on `b` and `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the expression \(\text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)\).

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
