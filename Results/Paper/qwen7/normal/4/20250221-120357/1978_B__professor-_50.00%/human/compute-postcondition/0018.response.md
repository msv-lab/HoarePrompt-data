Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
\[ \text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) \]

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Expression Analysis**:
   - `2 * b`: This is simply twice the value of `b`.
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This subtracts `n` from `2 * b` and then adds 1.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of the previous step by `n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`: This divides the result by 2.
   - `int(...)`: This converts the result to an integer.

2. **Variables**:
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are inputs, so their values are unknown but they are integers.
   - The expression does not depend on `t` or `_`.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression simplifies to \(\text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)\).

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
