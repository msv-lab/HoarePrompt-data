Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer and `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

The expression inside the `print` function is:
\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\right) \]

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate \(b - a\):**
   Since \(b \leq a\), \(b - a\) will be a non-positive integer. Let's denote \(b - a = k\), where \(k \leq 0\).

2. **Calculate \(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\):**
   Since \(k \leq 0\), \(k \times (k + 1)\) will be non-positive, and dividing by 2 will still result in a non-positive number. This term will be zero if \(k = 0\) and negative otherwise.

3. **Add \(a \times n\):**
   This term is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

4. **Take the integer part:**
   The integer part of the sum will be the same as the sum itself since the fractional part will be zero due to the non-positive nature of the first term.

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{int}(a \times n) \]

Given that `a` and `n` are input integers, the expression evaluates to the integer value of \(a \times n\).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a * n**
