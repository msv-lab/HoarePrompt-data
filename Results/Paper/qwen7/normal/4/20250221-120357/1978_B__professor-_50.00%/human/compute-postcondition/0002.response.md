Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is still 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the input, but their specific values are not provided, so they are described as input integers.
