Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Case when \( b \leq a \)**: If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is not beneficial to use the promotion, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit is then \( n \times a \).

2. **Case when \( b - a < n \)**: If the difference between the usual price \( a \) and the modified price \( b \) is less than the number of buns \( n \), it means that the promotion can only apply to fewer than \( n \) buns. The optimal strategy here is to sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price. The formula used calculates the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms and adds the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Case when \( b - a \geq n \)**: If the difference between the usual price \( a \) and the modified price \( b \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series from \( b \) down to \( b - n + 1 \).

The provided solution correctly handles all these cases and uses efficient formulas to compute the profit without unnecessary iterations, making it both correct and efficient.
