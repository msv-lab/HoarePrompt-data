Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `a` is the second integer from the input.
- `b` is the third integer from the input.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is:

\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n\right) \]

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate \( b - a \):** This is the difference between the second and first integers from the input.
2. **Calculate \( \frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b - a + 1) \):** This is the product of half the difference and one more than the difference.
3. **Add \( a \times n \):** Multiply the first integer by the third integer from the input and add this result to the previous product.
4. **Take the integer part:** Convert the result to an integer.

Given these steps, the output will be the integer value of the expression evaluated with the actual inputs for `a`, `b`, and `n`.

Output: **int(((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)) + a * n)**
