### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the price of the first bun (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`), the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price (`a`). This is correctly handled by the statement `print(n * a)`.
   
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it means Bob can sell all buns at the modified price (`b - i + 1` for the first `i` buns). The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This is the correct formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   
   - **Case 3: Otherwise**:
     - For other cases, the program uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and adds the usual price for the remaining buns. This is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `b` is very large compared to `a` or `n`, and where `b` is close to `a`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
