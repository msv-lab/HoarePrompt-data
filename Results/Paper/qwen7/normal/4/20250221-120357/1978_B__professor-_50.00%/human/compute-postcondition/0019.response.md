Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate \( b - a \):**
   This is the difference between `b` and `a`.

2. **Calculate \( (b - a) / 2 \):**
   This is half of the difference between `b` and `a`.

3. **Calculate \( (b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) \):**
   This is the product of half the difference between `b` and `a` and one more than the difference between `b` and `a`.

4. **Add \( a * n \) to the result from step 3:**
   This is the sum of the product from step 3 and the product of `a` and `n`.

5. **Take the integer part of the result:**
   Since the expression is already an integer due to the nature of the arithmetic operations involved, the `int` function does not change the value.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) = (b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n \]

So, the final output will be:
Output: **(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n**
