Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `m` are assigned the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100 is still valid, but `t` itself does not change.
