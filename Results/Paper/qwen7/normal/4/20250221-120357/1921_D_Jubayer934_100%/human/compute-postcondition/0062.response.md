Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `b[3]`, and the maximum of `abs(a[3] - b[-(n - 3)])` and `abs(a[3] - b[3])`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the new element added to `ans` is `abs(a[3] - b[3])`. Since `i` is incremented (though not shown in the snippet, it is implied by the context), `i` becomes 4. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
