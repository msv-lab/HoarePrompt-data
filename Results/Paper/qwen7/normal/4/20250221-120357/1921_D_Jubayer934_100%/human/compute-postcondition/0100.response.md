Postcondition: `i` is `temp + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains the maximum absolute difference between elements of arrays `a` and `b` at indices `i` and `-(n - i)`, respectively, where `i` is `temp + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the current `ans`, then `ans` is updated to this new value, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition in the if statement is false, `ans` remains unchanged.
