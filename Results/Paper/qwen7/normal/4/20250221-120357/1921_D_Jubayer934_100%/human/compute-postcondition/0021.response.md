Output State: **`i` is 2; `temp` is 2; `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `temp`, and `ans`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that was being executed. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
