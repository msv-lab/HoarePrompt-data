Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences as follows: the first element is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the second element is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`. If the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `b[-(n - 3)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `b[3]`, then `temp` is set to 3 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.
