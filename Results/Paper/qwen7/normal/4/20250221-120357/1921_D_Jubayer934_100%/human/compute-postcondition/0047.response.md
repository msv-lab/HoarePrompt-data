Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `temp` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are inside. However, the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `temp`, and the condition about the absolute differences between elements in arrays `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables and mentions that we have broken out of the loop.
