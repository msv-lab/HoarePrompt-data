Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The program initializes `temp` to `-1` and an empty list `ans`.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `b` (since `b` is sorted in descending order, we use `b[-(n - i)]` to get the largest remaining element).
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in `b` and appends it to `ans`.

4. **Optimization Check:**
   - If at any point the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This check is intended to ensure that the differences are maximized by potentially swapping the assignment of elements from `b`.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means there was a better choice found during the iteration.
   - It then replaces the remaining elements in `ans` with the calculated differences using `b[-(n - i)]`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Sorting:** Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that we can maximize the differences by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`.
- **Difference Calculation:** The logic for calculating the differences is correct.
- **Optimization Check:** The check to see if swapping the assignment of elements from `b` can increase the total difference is unnecessary and incorrect. The initial sorting already ensures that the maximum possible difference is achieved.
- **Final Adjustment:** The final adjustment step is redundant and incorrect because the initial sorting already provides the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly attempts to optimize the differences but fails to do so correctly. The initial sorting of `a` and `b` is sufficient to achieve the maximum difference. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
