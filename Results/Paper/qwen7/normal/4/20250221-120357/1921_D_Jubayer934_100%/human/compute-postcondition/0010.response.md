Postcondition: `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
