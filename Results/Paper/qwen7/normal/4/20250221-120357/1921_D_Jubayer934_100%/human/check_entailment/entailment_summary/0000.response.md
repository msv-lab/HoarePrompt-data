Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible total difference \(D\) between arrays \(a\) and \(c\), where \(c\) is constructed from a subset of \(b\). The goal is to maximize \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) and the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Both arrays are sorted: \(a\) in ascending order and \(b\) in descending order.
   - The program then iterates through the first \(n\) elements of \(b\) and pairs them with the corresponding elements of \(a\), calculating the absolute differences.
   - There is a check to see if swapping the pairing of elements (i.e., using the last \(n-i\) element of \(b\) instead of the \(i\)-th element) results in a larger difference. If so, it updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, if `temp` is not `-1`, it adjusts the remaining elements of \(a\) to use the last elements of \(b\) to maximize the differences.
   - Finally, it sums up the calculated differences and prints the result.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(b\) in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
   - The logic for checking and potentially swapping the pairing of elements in \(b\) is correct and aims to maximize the total difference.
   - The final summation of differences is correctly implemented.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
