Postcondition: `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing specific changes regarding `temp` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
