Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list containing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` based on the given conditions, `temp` remains `-1` because it was never updated beyond its initial assignment, and the condition `temp` is not equal to `-1` holds true.
