Output State: `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of the list `a` and the corresponding element of the list `b` starting from index `temp` to `n-1`, `i` equals `n`, `temp` is less than `n`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached `n`, and since the loop increments `i` in each iteration, it will continue to increment until it reaches `n`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged and is still less than `n`. The list `ans` will contain all the computed absolute differences as specified by the loop condition.
