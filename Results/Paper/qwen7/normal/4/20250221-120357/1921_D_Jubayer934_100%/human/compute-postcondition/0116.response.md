Output State: **All test cases have been processed, `i` equals `n`, `temp` is either -1 or the index where the condition was first violated, `ans` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid indices as per the loop logic, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `temp` retain their final states after processing all test cases.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` for each test case since the loop processes all elements in `a`. The variable `temp` will either remain -1 (if no condition was violated) or will hold the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met. The list `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of the absolute differences calculated for each test case according to the given logic. The lists `a` and `b` and the variable `temp` will retain their final states after processing all test cases.
