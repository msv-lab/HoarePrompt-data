Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `temp` equals `n`.
   - `b` is the same list as `ans`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(sum(ans))
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `temp` equals `n`, and `b` is the same list as `ans`, it implies that `b` is also the list of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` starting from index `n` to `n-1`. However, since `n-1` is the last index, this means `b` is empty because there are no elements from `n` to `n-1` (as `n-1` would be the same as `n`).

- Therefore, `ans` must also be an empty list because it contains the absolute differences from `temp` to `n-1`, and `temp` equals `n`.

- The sum of an empty list is `0`.

Thus, the print statement will output the sum of the list `ans`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
