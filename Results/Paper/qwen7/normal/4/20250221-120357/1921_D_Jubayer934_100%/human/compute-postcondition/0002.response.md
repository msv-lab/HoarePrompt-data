Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `temp` is -1.**

The code initializes `temp` to -1, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `temp` is updated to -1.
