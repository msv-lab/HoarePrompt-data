Output State: **`i` is 1, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it, and the values of `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, and `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the value of `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[1] - b[1])`. However, since the condition to break out of the loop is not checked within this line of code, the values of `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
