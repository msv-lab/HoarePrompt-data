Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `temp` is 0
   - `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - The variable `temp` is not directly involved in the loop condition and is not updated in the loop itself (assuming no other operations on `temp` within the loop body).
   - The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition or update.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `temp` remains 0.
   - `ans` remains the same (absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`**.
