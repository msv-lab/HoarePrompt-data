Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads `n` and `m` for each test case and then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Array `a` is sorted in ascending order, while array `b` is sorted in descending order. This is appropriate for the problem since we want to maximize the differences.

3. **Calculating Differences**: The code iterates through the first `n` elements of both sorted arrays and calculates the absolute differences. It checks if swapping the current element from `b` with the corresponding element from `b` in reverse order would yield a larger difference. If it finds such a swap, it updates the temporary variable `temp` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Applying Swaps**: If a swap is found (`temp` is not `-1`), the code appends the calculated differences for the remaining elements using the reversed order of `b`.

5. **Summing Differences**: Finally, the code sums up the differences stored in the `ans` list and prints the result.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference \(D\). The approach ensures that the differences are maximized by considering the best possible pairings between elements of `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **True**
