Output State: **`i` is 0, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans` will contain the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`. The values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged.
