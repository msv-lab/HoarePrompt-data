Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` equals `n`, `temp` equals `-1`, `b` is the same list `ans`, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
