Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the first n sorted integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of the top m largest integers from the first n sorted integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` integers from the user, sorts them, and then selects the top `m` largest integers from this sorted list. These top `m` integers are stored in the list `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
