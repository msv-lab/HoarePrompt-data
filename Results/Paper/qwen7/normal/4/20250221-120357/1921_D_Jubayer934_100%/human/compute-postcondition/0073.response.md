Postcondition: **`ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`, `i` equals `n`, `temp` equals `n`, and `b` is the same list `ans`.**

Explanation: Given the if condition `temp != -1`, the if part is executed. After the loop completes, `i` becomes equal to `n`, `temp` becomes equal to `n`, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part's behavior.
