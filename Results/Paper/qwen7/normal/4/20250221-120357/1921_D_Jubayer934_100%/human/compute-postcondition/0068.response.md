Output State: **`ans` now contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `i + 1` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. The conditions that `i + 1` is less than `n` and `temp` is less than `n` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated with the new element, but the exact value of the appended element cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
