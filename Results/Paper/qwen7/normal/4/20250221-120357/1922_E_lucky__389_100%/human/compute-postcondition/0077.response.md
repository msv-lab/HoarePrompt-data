Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `i` is set to 5.
2. We also know that `ansv` is a list containing the elements `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`.

When the `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement is executed, it will access the element at index `i` in the list `ansv`.

- The index `i` is 5.
- In Python, list indices start from 0. Therefore, the element at index 5 would correspond to the sixth element in the list if we were to count starting from 1.
- However, since the list only has 5 elements, the index 5 is out of bounds. Accessing an index that is out of bounds will raise an `IndexError`.

Given this, the precise output cannot be determined because the code will raise an error rather than printing anything.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
