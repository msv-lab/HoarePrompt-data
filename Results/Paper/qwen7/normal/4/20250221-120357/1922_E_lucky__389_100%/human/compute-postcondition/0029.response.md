Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `mx` is 4 (not part of the loop head)
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (not part of the loop head)
   - `x` is 4 (not part of the loop head)
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3] (not part of the loop head)
   - `i` is 1 (part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 1 and `x` is 4.
   - Evaluating the condition: `2 ** 1 <= 4` is true.
   - To continue the loop, we need to increment `i` to 2, because `2 ** 2 = 4` and `4 <= 4` is true.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop condition is met for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 2.

5. **Final State**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2**
