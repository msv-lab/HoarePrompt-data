Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the special case where \(X = 2\). It prints `1` followed by `0`, which is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

2. For other values of \(X\), the program attempts to decompose \(X\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is done using the inner `while` loop, which finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(X\) and subtracts it from \(X\), recording the length of the corresponding subsequence in `subseq_lens`.

3. The logic for constructing the array `ansv` is flawed. The program incorrectly appends elements from `subseq_lens` multiple times and does not properly handle the construction of the array to match the required number of increasing subsequences.

4. Specifically, the program prints the length of `ansv` as `3` instead of the actual length, and it prints the elements of `ansv` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect output format.

Given these points, the program does not correctly generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by \(X\).

Correctness: **False**
