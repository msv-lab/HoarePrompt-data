Postcondition: **`mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 2, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 4, i - 1], and `i` is at least 5.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `mx` can be either 4 or 6, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 1000, `x` is set to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 4, i - 1], and `i` is at least 5.
