You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    0 1 0

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an input integer \( x \) and calculates a sequence of subsequence lengths based on powers of 2. It then constructs a list `ansv` containing these lengths and prints the length of this list followed by its elements. The function does not return any value and is designed to handle inputs \( x \) within the range 2 to \( 10^{18} \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to produce an array for certain values of \(X\), particularly when \(X\) is a prime number greater than 2. For example, when \(X = 3\), the program does not provide a valid array. 

To illustrate, let's consider the case when \(X = 3\):

- The program tries to decompose \(X\) into powers of 2, but since 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, it fails to generate a valid array.
- The current implementation only handles cases where \(X\) can be decomposed into distinct powers of 2, which is insufficient to cover all possible \(X\) values.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
