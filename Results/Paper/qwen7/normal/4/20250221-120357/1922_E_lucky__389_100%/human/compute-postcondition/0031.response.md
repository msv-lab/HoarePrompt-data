Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
3. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must be true after the increment of `i`.

Given `i` is currently 3, let's evaluate the condition:
- The condition becomes `2 ** 3 <= x`, which simplifies to `8 <= x`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4, and the condition `2 ** 4 <= x` must hold true, which simplifies to `16 <= x`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be 4, and the condition `2 ** i <= x` must still hold true.

**State:**
State: **`i` is 4 and `2 ** i <= x` must hold true**
