Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(ansv))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `ansv` is `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ansv`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `ansv`.

4. **Calculate the length of `ansv`**:
   - `len(ansv)` is 5 because `ansv` has 5 elements.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5.
   - Since `i` is equal to the length of `ansv` (which is 5), the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < len(ansv)` is no longer true.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop does not execute again, there are no changes needed for `i`.
   - The list `ansv` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not occur) would be the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 5, `ansv` is `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`**
