Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to produce an array for certain values of \(X\), particularly when \(X\) is a prime number greater than 2. For example, when \(X = 3\), the program does not provide a valid array. 

To illustrate, let's consider the case when \(X = 3\):

- The program tries to decompose \(X\) into powers of 2, but since 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, it fails to generate a valid array.
- The current implementation only handles cases where \(X\) can be decomposed into distinct powers of 2, which is insufficient to cover all possible \(X\) values.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
