Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each element in the list `a`, assigning each element to the variable `water`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head objects**:
   - `water`: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: The list itself remains unchanged as it is the source of the loop.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop requirements**:
   - Since `water` will take on the value of each element in `a`, we don't need to adjust the state of `water` specifically because it will change dynamically within the loop.
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run.
   - The other variables (`total_water`, `n`, `target`, and `container`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values will be updated inside the loop or remain constant.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is 0, `a` must have at least one element**
