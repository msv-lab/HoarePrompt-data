Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input and splits it into individual components. This part is correct and ensures that the input is processed as expected.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of containers) and `a` (a list of integers representing the amount of water in each container).

3. **Initial Checks**:
   - It calculates the total amount of water (`total_water`).
   - It checks if `total_water` is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', indicating it's impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water because the total cannot be evenly distributed.

4. **Target Water Calculation**:
   - It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

5. **Water Distribution Check**:
   - It iterates through each container, adjusting the `container` variable to simulate the redistribution of water.
   - If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water without some containers having a negative amount, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, it means the redistribution is possible, and it returns 'Yes'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the total water is exactly divisible by `n` and the redistribution can be done without any container having a negative amount of water.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
