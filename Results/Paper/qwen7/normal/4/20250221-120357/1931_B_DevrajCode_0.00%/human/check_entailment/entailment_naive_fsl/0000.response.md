Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns "No", which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly if the total isn't divisible by `n`.

2. **Target Calculation**: If the total water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target is negative. If it ever becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water using the allowed operations, so the program returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".

This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements.
