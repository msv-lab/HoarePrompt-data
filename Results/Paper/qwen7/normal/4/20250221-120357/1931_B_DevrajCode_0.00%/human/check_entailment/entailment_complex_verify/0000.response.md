### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the logic step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This is crucial because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program correctly handles this case by returning "No".

2. **Target Calculation**:
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`). This is the average amount of water each container should have if the water is distributed evenly.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target. If at any point during this iteration, the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water using the allowed operations, so the program returns "No".
   - If the cumulative difference never becomes negative, it means the water can be balanced, and the program returns "Yes".

The annotated code provides a clear explanation of the program's state at key points, which aligns with the logic described above. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Final Evaluation:
