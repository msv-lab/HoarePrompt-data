Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for water in a:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `total_water`: This variable is the sum of the integers in list `a`. Since the loop is iterating over each element in `a`, `total_water` does not change within the loop itself. Therefore, its value remains the same.
   - `n`: This variable is a positive integer and does not change within the loop. Its value remains the same.
   - `target`: This is calculated as `total_water // n` and does not change within the loop. Its value remains the same.
   - `container`: This variable is adjusted based on whether it is less than 0. However, since the loop is just about to start a new iteration, there is no specific change to `container` yet.
   - `water`: This is the next element in the list `a` that the loop will process. At the start of the next iteration, `water` will be the next element in the list `a`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total_water` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `target` remains the same.
   - `container` remains the same (no specific change).
   - `water` changes to the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is adjusted based on whether it is less than 0, and `water` is the next element in the list `a`**.
