Output State: **`total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is `container + (water - target)`, and `water` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `container += water - target` updates the value of `container` by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to its current value. The other variables (`total_water`, `n`, `target`, and `water`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
