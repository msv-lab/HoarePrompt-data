Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts. This is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.
2. **Parsing Data**: It correctly parses the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to check if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers.
4. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
5. **Target Water Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
6. **Balance Check**: It iterates through each container, adjusting the balance (`container`) between having more or less water than the target. If at any point the balance goes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water, and it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
