Output State: `total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is adjusted according to whether it is less than 0 throughout all iterations. If `container` becomes less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the final value of `container` is the result of adjusting it for each element in the list `a` relative to the target value.
