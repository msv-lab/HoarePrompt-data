You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that the sum of the integers in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, and a is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: The total_water remains equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is adjusted such that it is never less than 0 throughout the entire execution of the loop. If at any point during the loop's execution, the `container` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function does not return anything and the final value of `container` is 0.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, if the loop did not return 'No' due to `container` becoming negative, the `container` variable will be 0. Otherwise, if `container` became negative at any point, the function would have returned 'No' before completing all iterations.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by `n`. It checks if it's possible to distribute the water in the list `a` such that no container ever has a negative amount of water. If at any point during the distribution, a container has a negative amount of water, the function returns 'No'. If the distribution can be done without any container having a negative amount of water, the function returns 'Yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it's always possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water per container is `total_water // n`.
   - If we can transfer water such that each container ends up with this target amount, the operation is successful.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by `n`.
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount is non-negative.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` by immediately returning 'No'.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the initial distribution is already even, returning 'Yes' without further checks.

5. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input reading and splitting logic is correct for multiple test cases.
   - The function call and output format match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
