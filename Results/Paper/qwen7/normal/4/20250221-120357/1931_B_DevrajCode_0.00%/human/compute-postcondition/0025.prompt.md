You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that the sum of the integers in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, and a is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: Output State: The total_water remains equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is adjusted such that it is never less than 0 throughout the entire execution of the loop. If at any point during the loop's execution, the `container` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function does not return anything and the final value of `container` is 0.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, if the loop did not return 'No' due to `container` becoming negative, the `container` variable will be 0. Otherwise, if `container` became negative at any point, the function would have returned 'No' before completing all iterations.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. Based on the given conditions, the function has five possible return cases, all of which return either 'No' or 'Yes'. 
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by `n`, and return 'Yes' under specific conditions (which are not detailed here), and 'No' otherwise.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'No'

Case_3: The program returns 'No'

Case_4: The program returns 'No'

Case_5: The program returns 'Yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
