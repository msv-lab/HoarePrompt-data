Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1` for all reachable nodes), and the queue `q` is empty. The graph `graph[ver]` does not contain any unvisited nodes, indicating that the entire connected component of the starting node has been fully processed.
