Output State: **`q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from the deque, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is set to 1, and `vis` is unchanged except for the element at index `ver` which is now 1.**

This means that the first element (`ver`) from the deque `q` has been removed and assigned to the variable `ver`. The deque `q` now contains the remaining elements. The value of `vis[ver]` has been set to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. All other variables remain in their initial states.
