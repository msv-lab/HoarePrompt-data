Output State: **`q` now contains the node that was appended, `ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is currently equal to 0, and `q` contains at least one node excluding the one that was just removed.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. This means that the list `q` now includes the `node` that was added. The variable `ver` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. The condition that `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is currently equal to 0 still holds true. Additionally, since `q` was stated to contain at least one node excluding the one that was just removed, this condition also remains valid.
