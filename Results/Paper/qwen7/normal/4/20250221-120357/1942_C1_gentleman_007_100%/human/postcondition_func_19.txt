The function accepts a non-negative integer x and returns either 0 or 1 if x is 0 or 1. Otherwise, it returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x. This is achieved through a binary search-like process where the function adjusts the search range (using variables l and r) to find the appropriate integer. The function guarantees that upon completion, it will have found and returned the correct integer value based on the conditions specified.
