Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list constructed during the loop's execution, and `s` is a string formed by joining the elements of `l`.**

Explanation: The code snippet joins the elements of the list `l` into a string `s` using the `join` method. Since `l` is constructed during the loop based on the conditions specified, and the loop terminates when both `i` and `j` become zero, the values of `i` and `j` remain zero. The list `l` retains the elements accumulated during the loop, and `s` is the string formed by joining these elements.
