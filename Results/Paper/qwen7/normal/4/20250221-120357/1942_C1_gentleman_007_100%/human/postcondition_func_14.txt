The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It calculates the factorial of each integer from `0` to `n` (inclusive), taking the result modulo `mod`, and stores these values in a list `f`. After completing the calculations, the function returns the list `f`. Additionally, the loop variable `i` is set to `n + 1`.
