The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, while `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph based on the vertices chosen by Bessie. For each of the `m` iterations, `func_1()` is called to obtain a pair of integers `(x, y)` representing the vertices. These pairs are added to the corresponding lists in `l`, creating an adjacency list where `l[i]` contains all vertices connected to vertex `i`. The function returns the resulting adjacency list `l`, along with the value of `m` indicating the number of vertices chosen and `i` set to `m-1` to indicate the last iteration.
