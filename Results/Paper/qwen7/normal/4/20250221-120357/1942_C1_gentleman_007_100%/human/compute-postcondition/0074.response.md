Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j - 1`, `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, and `l` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `i` and `j` have been decremented by 1, `dp[i][j]` still does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j]`, and a new element `a[i]` has been appended to the list `l`.
