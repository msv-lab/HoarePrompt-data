Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are non-zero integers. If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1 and `j` remains non-zero. In either case, `dp[i][j]` is updated accordingly and does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]` unless specified.**
