Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i != 0 and j != 0`.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `j`.

3. **Understand the Loop Body**: 
   - If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is decreased by 1.
   - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are decreased by 1, and a list `l` containing one element `a[i]` is created.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are non-zero integers.
   - For the loop to continue, both `i` and `j` must still be non-zero.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` and `j` are non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, they can either both be decreased (if `dp[i][j]` does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]`) or just `i` can be decreased (if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`).
   - Regardless of the exact changes made in the loop body, as long as `i` and `j` are non-zero, the loop can continue.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that both `i` and `j` remain non-zero for the next iteration. Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed beyond ensuring that `i` and `j` are non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` and `j` are non-zero integers**
