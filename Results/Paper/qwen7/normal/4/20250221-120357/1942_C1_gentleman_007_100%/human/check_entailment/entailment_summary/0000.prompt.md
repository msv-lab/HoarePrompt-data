# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads input from the standard input, specifically three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) for each test case. These integers satisfy the conditions \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5) \), and \( y = 0 \). The function then returns these three integers as a result.
Function number 2 :

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads a series of test cases from user input. For each test case, it returns a list containing x distinct integers, each ranging from 1 to n, as specified by the user.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, v):
    return [v for i in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `v`, a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. After executing, it returns a new list where the elements of list `v` are repeated `n` times.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(n, m, v):
    return [[v for i in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts three parameters: `n` (representing the number of sides of a polygon), `m` (representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen). It returns a 2D list where each row contains the same `m` integers from the list `v`, repeated `n` times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''

        l[y].append(x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, while `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph based on the vertices chosen by Bessie. For each of the `m` iterations, `func_1()` is called to obtain a pair of integers `(x, y)` representing the vertices. These pairs are added to the corresponding lists in `l`, creating an adjacency list where `l[i]` contains all vertices connected to vertex `i`. The function returns the resulting adjacency list `l`, along with the value of `m` indicating the number of vertices chosen and `i` set to `m-1` to indicate the last iteration.
Function number 6 :

        l[x][y] = 1
        l[y][x] = 1
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function iterates `m` times, each time calling `func_1()` to get a pair of vertex indices `(x, y)` (where `1 ≤ x, y ≤ n` and `x ≠ y`). It then marks these pairs in a 2D list `l` by setting `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` to 1. After completing the iterations, the function returns the 2D list `l` with dimensions `m + 3` by `m + 3`, where `m` pairs of indices are marked as 1, indicating the chosen vertex pairs. The variables `x` and `y` represent the last pair of indices returned by `func_1()`.

def func_7(l):
    d = {}
    for i in l:
        d[i] = d.get(i, 0) + 1
    return d
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function accepts a list of integers `l` and processes each integer by counting their occurrences, storing these counts in a dictionary `d`. After processing all elements in `l`, it returns the dictionary `d`, which contains each unique integer from `l` as keys and their respective counts as values. Finally, the function returns an empty dictionary because the original list `l` is emptied during the process.
Function number 8 :

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a 2D list `l` and returns a 2D list `p` where each element `p[i][j]` (with `i` ranging from 1 to `n` and `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`) is the cumulative sum of all elements in the 2D list `l` up to the last row and column.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):

''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts an integer x within the range [2, min(n, 200000)], where n is the number of sides of a polygon. It checks whether x is a power of 2. If x is a power of 2, the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1.

''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are the corresponding prime factors of `num`. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of the original `num` and its value is the total count of that prime factor in the prime factorization of the original `num`. After executing, the function fully decomposes `num` into its prime factors and counts their occurrences, storing these in the returned dictionary `d`.

''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 4 to \(10^9\) and returns a dictionary `d`. This dictionary contains the prime factorization of the initial `n`, where each key is a prime factor and its corresponding value is the count of that prime factor in the factorization. If `n` is reduced to 1 after the factorization process, the dictionary `d` will be empty, indicating that 1 has no prime factors.
Function number 14 :
 Code:

 Output hints for function15:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It calculates the factorial of each integer from `0` to `n` (inclusive), taking the result modulo `mod`, and stores these values in a list `f`.

 Output hints for function20:  The function accepts a non-negative integer x and returns either 0 or 1 if x is 0 or 1. Otherwise, it returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

 Output hints for function25:  The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the given vertex `ver`. It marks all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited in the `vis` list and prints the visited vertices in the order they were visited. The function does not return any value but modifies the `vis` list to indicate visited nodes.
