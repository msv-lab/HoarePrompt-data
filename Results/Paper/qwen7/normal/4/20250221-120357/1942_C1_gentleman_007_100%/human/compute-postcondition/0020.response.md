Output State: **`q` contains `node` and `ver`, `ver` is unchanged, `graph` is unchanged, `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` simply updates the value of `vis[node]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `vis[node]` and retains the unchanged values of `q`, `ver`, `graph`, and the original value of `vis[ver]`.
