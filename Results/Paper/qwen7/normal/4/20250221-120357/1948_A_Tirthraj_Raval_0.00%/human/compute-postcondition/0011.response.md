Output State: **`i` is 1; `pattern` is a list containing 'AB'**

Explanation: The code `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` first calculates the value of `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `i % 2` is 1 (since 1 modulo 2 equals 1), and `1 ^ 1` is 0 (since XOR of 1 with itself is 0). So, `'AB'[0]` is 'A'. Therefore, the list `pattern` appends 'A' to itself, resulting in a list containing 'A' repeated twice. However, since 'A' was already in the list, the list remains unchanged. Thus, `pattern` is still a list containing 'A'.
