State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial value of `t` being an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) ensures that `t` is a positive integer, but we need to explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
