Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the input format and constraints specified in the problem statement.
- It checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters with an odd `n`.
- If `n` is even, the function constructs a string of length `n` using alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. This ensures that every character except the first and last will be a special character since they will each have exactly one different neighbor.
- The generated string will always have the required number of special characters (all but the first and last characters), and the length of the string is controlled within the limit of 200 characters, as required by the problem statement.
- The function correctly handles multiple test cases as specified.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
