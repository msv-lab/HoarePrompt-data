Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the value of `t` after executing the code will be the input integer within this range. The variable `n` is not defined in the given code, so its initial state remains unchanged.
