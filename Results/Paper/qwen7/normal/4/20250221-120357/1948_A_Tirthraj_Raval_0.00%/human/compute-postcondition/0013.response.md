Output State: **`i` is 2; `pattern` is a list containing 'AB', 'A'; `n` must be at least 5**

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is 2, `i % 2` equals 0, so `'AB'[0]` is `'A'`. Thus, `'A'` is appended to the list `pattern`, which originally contains `['AB']`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
