Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
