Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. Additionally, a list of n integers c represents the numbers written on the cards, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` must still be greater than 0 (since it was initially an integer between 1 and 500, and the loop continues as long as `i < t`). The variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, will be equal to `t-1` after the last iteration. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` will correspond to the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop, but since the loop has completed, these values will not change further.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `c`. For each test case, it prints the value `k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
