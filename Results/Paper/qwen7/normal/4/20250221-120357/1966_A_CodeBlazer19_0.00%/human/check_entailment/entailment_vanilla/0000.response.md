Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program currently only prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual numbers on the cards or performing any operations.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of the program does not match the problem description. According to the problem, we need to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards.
   - The program simply prints `k - 1` regardless of the actual card values, which is not a correct approach.

### Example Cases

Let's consider the example cases provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5 3
     4 1 1 4 4
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     2
     ```

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1 10
     7
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     9
     ```

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     7 2
     4 2 1 100 5 2 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1
     ```

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     10 4
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     3
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     3
     ```

From the examples, we can see that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It always prints `k - 1` instead of finding the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem requirements and always outputs `k - 1` instead of the correct minimum number of cards.

**Correctness: False**
