Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `n` is an input integer (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `k` is an input integer (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers (though its value is not needed for the print statement).

The print statement is `print(k - 1)`. Since `k` is an input integer, the expression `k - 1` will simply be `k` decremented by 1. The exact value of `k - 1` depends on the value of `k`, but since `k` is an input integer, we can only express the result in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an input integer)**
