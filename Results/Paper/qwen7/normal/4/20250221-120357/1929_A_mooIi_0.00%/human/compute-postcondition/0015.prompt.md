You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have processed all the test cases provided as input. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers for that specific test case.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have read all the test cases, sorted the integers provided for each test case in ascending order, and printed them out. Each test case's output will reflect the sorted integers for that particular set of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It does not return any value directly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
