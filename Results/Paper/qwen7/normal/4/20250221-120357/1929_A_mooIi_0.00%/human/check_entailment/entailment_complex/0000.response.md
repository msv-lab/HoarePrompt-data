Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints it, which does not maximize the beauty of the array.
- To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the largest possible differences between consecutive elements are achieved. This can be done by sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the beauty.
- The current implementation does not perform any calculation to find the maximum beauty; instead, it just prints the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
