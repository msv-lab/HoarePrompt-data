Functionality: **The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 500 \)), an integer \( n \) (number of integers in each test case, where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \)), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (each integer in the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)). It sorts these integers in ascending order and prints them out. The function does not return any value but ensures that all test cases are processed and their sorted integers are printed accordingly.**
