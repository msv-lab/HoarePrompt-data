You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have processed all the test cases provided as input. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers for that specific test case.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have read all the test cases, sorted the integers provided for each test case in ascending order, and printed them out. Each test case's output will reflect the sorted integers for that particular set of inputs.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - For the beauty to be maximized, we should arrange the elements such that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then converts the list of integers into a map of strings, sorts them, and prints them back out as a space-separated string of sorted integers.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - Sorting the array will not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined.
   - For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. If sorted, it becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty would be calculated as `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`.
   - However, the optimal arrangement could be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`, giving a beauty of `(90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 + -10 + -26 + -11 = -57`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. It simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined.
