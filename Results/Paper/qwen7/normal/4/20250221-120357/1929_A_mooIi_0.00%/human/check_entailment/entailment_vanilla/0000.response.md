### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \).
   - It then reads the array elements and sorts them.
   - Finally, it prints the sorted array as a string.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined.
   - The beauty is maximized when the largest values are placed in positions where they contribute positively to the sum of differences, and the smallest values are placed where they contribute negatively.
   - Simply sorting the array and printing it will not achieve this optimal arrangement.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest value at the start and the smallest value at the end of the array, with the remaining values in any order in between.
   - This ensures that the largest difference is used at the beginning of the sum, contributing the most to the total.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example test case `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`, but the optimal arrangement is `[3, 1, 2]` which results in a beauty of \( (3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), not 2.
   - For `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the optimal arrangement could be `[100, 43, 54, 80, 90]` resulting in a beauty of \( (100 - 43) + (43 - 54) + (54 - 80) + (80 - 90) = 57 - 11 - 26 - 10 = 57 - 47 = 10 \), not 57.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not maximize the beauty as required.

**Correctness: False**
