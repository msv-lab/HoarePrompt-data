### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points to the total score (if there is a clear winner and loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw). Hence, the total score must be even.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` immediately, indicating an inconsistency in the scores.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated while respecting the constraints of the scores.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the scores might not be achievable due to the constraints of the game rules. For instance, in the case where `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, the program correctly identifies that this scenario is impossible and prints `-1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. It handles the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
