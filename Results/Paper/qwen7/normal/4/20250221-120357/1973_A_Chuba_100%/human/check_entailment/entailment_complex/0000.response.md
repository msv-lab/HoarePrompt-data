Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\).
3. The program checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is odd. If the sum is odd, it immediately prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players in case of a draw).
4. If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - \max(0, p_2 - p_1 - p_3))}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total (1 point to each player) and each win/loss scenario contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other. The term \(\max(0, p_2 - p_1 - p_3)\) ensures that the calculation only considers valid scenarios where the points can be distributed according to the rules.
5. The program prints the calculated result, which is the maximum number of draws.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct. The program handles all edge cases appropriately, such as when the sum of the scores is odd, and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
