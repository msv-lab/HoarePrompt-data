Output: **-1**

Explanation: The initial state only provides information about the variable `t` being greater than -1 and `v` being a list of integers converted from input integers. The `print('-1')` statement directly prints the string `-1` without referencing any other variables or their values. Therefore, the output is simply `-1`.
