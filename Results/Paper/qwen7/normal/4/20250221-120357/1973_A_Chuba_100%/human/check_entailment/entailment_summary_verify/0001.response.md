### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points to the total score (if there is a clear winner and loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw). Hence, the total score must be even.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` immediately, indicating an inconsistency in the scores.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated while respecting the constraints of the scores.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the scores might not be achievable due to the constraints of the game rules. However, there is a critical flaw in the calculation of the maximum number of draws.

5. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case `1 1 10`. According to the problem statement, the scores should be achievable through a series of games. However, the current implementation fails to handle this case correctly. The formula used in the program does not account for the fact that the maximum number of draws can only be achieved if the scores are distributed in a way that allows for equal or nearly equal distribution of wins and losses.
   - Specifically, the formula `result = (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. For the case `1 1 10`, the correct maximum number of draws should be 2, but the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum number of draws. The formula used does not correctly handle the distribution of scores to maximize the number of draws.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
