State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
- Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
