Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the output state reflects that `t` is now an input integer within this range. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
