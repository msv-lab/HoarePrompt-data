### Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Drawing**: The condition `if a > c:` is used to determine a draw, which is incorrect. The game should end in a draw if neither player can make a move, not just if Alice is below Bob vertically.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Moves**: The logic for calculating the possible moves and determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and the subsequent checks for `l` and `r` do not correctly account for the rules of the game.

3. **Incorrect Use of `print` Statements**: The use of `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` and similar constructs is unnecessary and can lead to syntax errors. The correct way to print the result is simply `print('Alice')` or `print('Bob')` or `print('Draw')`.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle edge cases where the chips are very close to the boundaries of the board, which could affect the outcome of the game.

Given these issues, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Correct Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Determine who starts and who can move next
        if xa < xb:
            # Alice starts and can move down, down-right, or down-left
            if ya < yb:
                # Alice can move down-right or down-left
                if yb - ya <= 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            elif ya > yb:
                # Alice can move down-left or down-right
                if yb - ya <= 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            else:
                # Alice can only move down
                if xb - xa <= 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
        else:
            # Bob starts and can move up, up-right, or up-left
            if yb < ya:
                # Bob can move up-right or up-left
                if ya - yb <= 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            elif yb > ya:
                # Bob can move up-right or up-left
                if ya - yb <= 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            else:
                # Bob can only move up
                if xa - xb <= 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the different scenarios and ensures that the game outcome is determined accurately based on the rules provided.
