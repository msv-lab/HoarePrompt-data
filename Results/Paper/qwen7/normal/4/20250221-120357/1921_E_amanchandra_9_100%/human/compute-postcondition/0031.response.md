Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is one less than its previous value.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `x` is updated to the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `r` is updated to the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Values of `x`:**
   - Initially, `x` is set to the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - Since `x` is updated again to the same value, `x` remains the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.

2. **Values of `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - Both `l` and `r` depend on the values of `b`, `w`, and `x`.

3. **Condition in Print Statement:**
   - The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` checks if both `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are true.
   - If both conditions are true, the print statement will print `['Draw']`.
   - Otherwise, it will print `['Bob']`.

### Determining the Output:

- The values of `l` and `r` are dependent on the inputs `b`, `w`, and `x`.
- Without specific values for `b`, `w`, `a`, `c`, and `d`, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`.
- However, we can determine the structure of the condition and the possible outcomes.

Given the structure, the output depends on the values of `l`, `r`, and `d` relative to `x`. Since we don't have specific values, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the condition.

### Final Output:

Output: **['Draw'] if abs(max(1, b - x) - d) <= x and abs(min(w, b + x) - d) <= x, otherwise ['Bob']**
