Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t > 0`: This tells us that `t` is a positive number, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `r = min(w, b + x)`: `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input.
   - `l = max(1, b - x)`: `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
   - `x = abs(a - c) / 2`: `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

   - The expression inside the `print` function uses a conditional check to determine which list to print.
   - The check is `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
     - `abs(l - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - `abs(r - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If both conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are true, the expression evaluates to `['Draw']`.
   - If either or both conditions are false, the expression evaluates to `['Bob']`.

Given the initial state, let's assume some reasonable values for `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` to illustrate the possible outcomes:

- Suppose `a = 10`, `c = 6`, then `x = abs(10 - 6) / 2 = 2`.
- Suppose `b = 8`, `w = 7`, `d = 9`, and `x = 2`.
- Then `r = min(7, 8 + 2) = 7`.
- And `l = max(1, 8 - 2) = 6`.

Now, evaluate the conditions:
- `abs(l - d) = abs(6 - 9) = 3`, which is not less than or equal to `x = 2`.
- `abs(r - d) = abs(7 - 9) = 2`, which is less than or equal to `x = 2`.

Since only one condition is true, the expression evaluates to `['Bob']`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **['Bob']**
