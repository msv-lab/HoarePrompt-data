Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. These represent the height of the board, width of the board, Alice's position `(a, b)`, and Bob's position `(c, d)`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `a > c`. If true, it prints 'Draw'. This condition seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal moves of both players. Instead, it should check the relative positions and possible moves.

3. **Relative Position Calculation:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions (`x = abs(a - c)`).
   - If this difference is odd, it calculates the possible column range for Alice's next move (`l` and `r`).
   - If this difference is even, it calculates the possible column range for Bob's next move (`l` and `r`).

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program then checks if Alice or Bob can win based on the calculated ranges and the other player's current column position.
   - If Alice can win, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If Bob can win, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initial Condition:**
   - The condition `if a > c:` is incorrect. The program should check if Alice can force a win or if Bob can force a win based on their relative positions and possible moves.

2. **Column Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Alice and Bob is not correctly reflecting the possible moves. The logic for determining if Alice or Bob can win needs to be more precise.

3. **Winning Condition Logic:**
   - The logic to determine if Alice or Bob can win is flawed. It doesn't correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players.

### Correct Solution:
The correct approach involves simulating the optimal moves of both players and checking if either can force a win. Given the constraints, we need to consider the following:
- Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left.
- Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left.
- The game ends in a draw if either player cannot make a move.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
