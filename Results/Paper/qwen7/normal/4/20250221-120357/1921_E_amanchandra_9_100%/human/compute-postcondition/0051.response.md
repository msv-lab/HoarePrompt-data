Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The function returns a value based on the relationship between (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b).**

This means the function takes six integers as inputs and checks the relationship between two points (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) within specified ranges. The function then returns a value based on whether these points are distinct in their x-coordinates or y-coordinates.
