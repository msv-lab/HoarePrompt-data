Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left. The values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` will be updated to the last set of values provided by the user input during the last iteration of the loop. `l` will also be updated to the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even.**

This means that once the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0, signifying the end of the loop. All the other variables (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x`) will hold the values they were assigned in the last iteration of the loop, reflecting the final state of the computation based on the last set of inputs provided.
