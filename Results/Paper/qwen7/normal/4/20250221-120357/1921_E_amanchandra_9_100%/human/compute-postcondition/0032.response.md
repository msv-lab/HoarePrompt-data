Postcondition: `t` is one less than its previous value, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `b + x` or `d + x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `b - x` or `d - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, and `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
