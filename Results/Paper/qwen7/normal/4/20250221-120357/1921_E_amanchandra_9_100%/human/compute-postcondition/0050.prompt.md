Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even), `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` retain their original values, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is one less than its previous value, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, and `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, and `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
