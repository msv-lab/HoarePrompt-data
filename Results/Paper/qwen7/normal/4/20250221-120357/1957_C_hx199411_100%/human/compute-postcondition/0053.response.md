Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`, and `t` is `False`**.

The variable `t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
