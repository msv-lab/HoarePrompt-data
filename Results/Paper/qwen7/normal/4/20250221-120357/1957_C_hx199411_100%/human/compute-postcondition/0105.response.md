Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is 0, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.**

Explanation: The line `num = 0` sets the variable `num` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
