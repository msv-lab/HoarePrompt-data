Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and still holds the value 0, and `k` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before the code execution.
