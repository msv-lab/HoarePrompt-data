Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is `c + 1`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `num` is either 3, 2, or 1, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Since `num` was initially either 2, 1, or 3, after adding 1, it becomes 3, 2, or 1 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
