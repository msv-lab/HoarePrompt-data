Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the moves made by the user. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program checks if `c == r` for each move. If true, it increments `num` by 1, otherwise, it increments `num` by 2. This logic correctly accounts for the fact that the computer mirrors the move unless `r == c`.

3. **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This correctly accounts for the remaining positions on the board after the initial moves.

4. **Base Cases**: The program handles the base cases where `m == 0` or `m == 1` correctly, printing 1 in both cases. This is because if there are no remaining positions (`m == 0`), there's only one way to place rooks (or none at all), and if there is exactly one remaining position (`m == 1`), there's also only one way to place a rook.

5. **Dynamic Programming**: For the general case where `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. The recurrence relation used is correct:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - This relation correctly accounts for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and then recursively calculating the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

6. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
