Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not defined initially, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `k` is an input integer, and its value is known.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and will increment in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `k` is already given as an input integer, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `i` is 0.
- `k` remains as the input integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an input integer**
