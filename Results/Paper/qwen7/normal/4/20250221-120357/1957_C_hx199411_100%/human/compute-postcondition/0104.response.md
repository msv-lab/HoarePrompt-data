Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `m`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`, and the conditions on `k` and `i` remain unchanged.
