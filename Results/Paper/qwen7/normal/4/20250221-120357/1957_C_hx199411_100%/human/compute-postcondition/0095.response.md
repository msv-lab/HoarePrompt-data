Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `dp[i]` is \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\)
- The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `m`.

### Loop Head Analysis
- The loop variable `i` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop condition is `i` ranging from 3 to `m`.

### Previous Iteration
- Let's assume the previous iteration was for some value of `i = k`.
- After the previous iteration, `dp[k]` is updated according to the formula: \((dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

### Current Iteration
- For the current iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- We need to update the state for the next iteration where `i = k + 1`.

### Updating the State
- `dp[k + 1]` will be calculated using the formula: \((dp[k] + k * dp[k - 1] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).
- The variable `i` will be `k + 1`.

### Final State
- `dp[i]` will be \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), where `i = k + 1`.
- Therefore, `dp[k + 1]` will be the new value of `dp[i]`.

### Updated State
- The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`.
- The value of `i` will be `k + 1` for the next iteration.
- The value of `dp[i]` will be updated accordingly.

### Conclusion
- The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the updated value of `dp[i]`.

### Answer
State: **`dp[i]` is \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), `i` is `k + 1`**.

Given the previous iteration details, if `i` was `k` before, then for the next iteration:

State: **`dp[i]` is \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), `i` is `k + 1`**.
