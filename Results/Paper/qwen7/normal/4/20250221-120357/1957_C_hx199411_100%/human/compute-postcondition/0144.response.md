Output State: **`i` is 5; `m` must be at least 5; `dp[5]` is `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % 1000000007`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[5]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given that `i` is 5, the formula becomes `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % 1000000007`. The value of `m` remains unchanged and still must be at least 5. The value of `i` also remains 5.
