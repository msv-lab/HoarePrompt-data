Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is `c + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2. Since `c` is the first integer from the input split by space, the new value of `num` is `c + 2`. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
