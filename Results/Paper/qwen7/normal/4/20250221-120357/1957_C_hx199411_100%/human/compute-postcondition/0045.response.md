Output State: **`m` is `n - 2 * k` and must be greater than or equal to `k - 2`, `i` is `k + 2` and must be at least `5`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `i` is defined as `k + 2` and must be at least `5`, and there are no initial values given for `dp`, the updated value of `dp[i]` is expressed in terms of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
