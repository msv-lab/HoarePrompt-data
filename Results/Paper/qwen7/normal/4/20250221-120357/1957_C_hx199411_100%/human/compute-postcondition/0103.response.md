Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `k`.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially `True`, decrementing it results in `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
