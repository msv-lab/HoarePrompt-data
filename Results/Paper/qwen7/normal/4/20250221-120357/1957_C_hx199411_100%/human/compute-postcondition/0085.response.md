Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`
- `i` is equal to `k`
- `k` is an input integer
- `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration
- `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration
- `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations
- `t` is `False`
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `i` must be less than `k`
- The current value of `m` is 1

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, only the number 1 will be printed.

Output: **1**
