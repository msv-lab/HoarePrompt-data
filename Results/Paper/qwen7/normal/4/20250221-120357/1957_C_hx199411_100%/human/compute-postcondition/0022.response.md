Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is `c` + 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is `c` + 3**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Initially, `num` was `c + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `c + 2` otherwise. After incrementing by 2, `num` becomes `c + 3` if `c` equals `r`, or `c + 4` otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
