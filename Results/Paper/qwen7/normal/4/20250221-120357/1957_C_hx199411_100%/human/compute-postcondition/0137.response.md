Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `m` is `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`, `i` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1**

Explanation: The line `dp[1] = 1` sets the first element of the list `dp` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
