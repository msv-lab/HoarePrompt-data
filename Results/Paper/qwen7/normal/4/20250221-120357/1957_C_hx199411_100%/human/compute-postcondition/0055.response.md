Output State: **`m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, `num` is 0, and `t` is `False`.**

The code `num = 0` sets the variable `num` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
