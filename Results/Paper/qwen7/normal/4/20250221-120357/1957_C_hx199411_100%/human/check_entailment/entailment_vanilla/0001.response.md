Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program iterates through the `k` moves.
   - For each move, it checks if the row index `c` is equal to the column index `r`.
     - If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a diagonal move).
     - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a non-diagonal move).

3. **Calculating Remaining Empty Cells:**
   - After processing all moves, it calculates the number of remaining empty cells `m` as `n - num`.

4. **Base Cases:**
   - If `m == 0`, it prints `1` because there are no more cells to place rooks.
   - If `m == 1`, it also prints `1` because there is only one cell left, and it can be either a white or black rook.

5. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - If `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in a grid of size `i x i` under the given constraints.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger values of `i`, it updates `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

### Verification of Logic:

- **Base Cases:**
  - When `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the logic is correct. There is exactly one way to fill the board with rooks in these cases.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The recurrence relation used in the DP calculation is correct for the problem. It accounts for placing rooks in the remaining cells while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and handles large numbers correctly.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
