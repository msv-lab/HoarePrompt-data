Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; n and k retain their original values, and r_i and c_i remain undefined.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, and `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`. If `m` is 0, then `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times plus the additional value added during each iteration. Otherwise, if `m` is 1 and `i` equals `k`, or `m` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and `i` is `k + 2`, `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements where `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and for each index `i` from `3` to `m`, `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `k`. Additionally, if `m` is 0, then the current value of `m` is 0. Otherwise, `m` is 1, or the `dp` list will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `m` is 0 or `m` is `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`. If `m` is 0, then `i` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `m`. `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, and if `m` is not 0, `dp[m]` is calculated as `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
