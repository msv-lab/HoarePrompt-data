The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers t, n, k, and pairs of integers (r, c). For each test case, it calculates the number of valid moves and computes a result based on the remaining positions after these moves. If no valid positions remain, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute and print a specific value related to the remaining positions.
