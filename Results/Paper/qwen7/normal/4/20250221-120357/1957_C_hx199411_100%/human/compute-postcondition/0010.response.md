Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is 2.**

The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` was initially 0, after executing this line, `num` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
