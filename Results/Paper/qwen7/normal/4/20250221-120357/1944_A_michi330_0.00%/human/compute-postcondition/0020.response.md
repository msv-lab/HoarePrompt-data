Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether the condition `k >= n - 1` is true or false, as both the if and else parts maintain the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.
