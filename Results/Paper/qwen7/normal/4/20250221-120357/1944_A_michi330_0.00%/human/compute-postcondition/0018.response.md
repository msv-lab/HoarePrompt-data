Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `k` is the second integer from the input. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1, which does not depend on any of the other variables defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output is **1**.
