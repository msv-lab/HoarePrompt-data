Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(0, t, 1)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same (a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive).
- `i` is now 2.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
