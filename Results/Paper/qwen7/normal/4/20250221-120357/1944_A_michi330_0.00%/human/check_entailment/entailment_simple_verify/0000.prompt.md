You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, i is 3, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the first iteration's input. The values of t, i, n, and k remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition k >= n - 1 is true or false for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than just island 1. Specifically, if `k < n-1`, Everule can still visit all islands except the one that would be isolated by the bridge destructions. 

For example, consider the case `n=4` and `k=1`. The program incorrectly outputs `n-1=3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because destroying one bridge (e.g., between islands 1 and 2) leaves Everule unable to visit island 2, but he can still visit islands 1, 3, and 4. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
