Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(0, t, 1)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\) inclusive.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range (1 to \(10^3\)) for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\) inclusive.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\) inclusive**
