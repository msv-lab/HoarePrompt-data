Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged with its value being 2.
