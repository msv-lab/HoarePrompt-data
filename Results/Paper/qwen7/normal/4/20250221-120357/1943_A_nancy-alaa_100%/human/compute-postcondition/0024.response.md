Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`, which means it was likely set to `False` before this code snippet.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `1`.
- There is a condition that checks if `i` (which is `1`) is not in the keys of `mpp`. If this condition is true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, the `print(i)` statement will execute and print the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
