Output: **i (where i is n + 1)**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `i` is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer. Since `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, it means that `i` has been assigned the value of `n + 1`. When the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.
