Output State: **Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `first`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp`.
