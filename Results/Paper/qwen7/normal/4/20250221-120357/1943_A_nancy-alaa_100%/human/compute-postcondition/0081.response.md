Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, or `first` is false, the program continues without breaking. Otherwise, `first` is set to True.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in `range(n + 1)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **`i`**: It will be incremented to 2.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - **`first`**: We need to consider the condition under which `first` might be set to True. However, since the current value of `i` is 1 and it will be incremented to 2, we don't know if this change will trigger the condition to set `first` to True. Therefore, we assume `first` remains unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

5. **Final State**: Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
   - `first` remains unchanged (we cannot determine its new value without additional information)

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `first` remains unchanged**
