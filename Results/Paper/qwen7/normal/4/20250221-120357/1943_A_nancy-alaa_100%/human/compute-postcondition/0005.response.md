Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(n + 1)` generates values from 0 to `n`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Identify other relevant variables**: While `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are part of the program state, they are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Formulate the required state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to 0, and `n` should be available but does not need to be adjusted since its value is already known.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
