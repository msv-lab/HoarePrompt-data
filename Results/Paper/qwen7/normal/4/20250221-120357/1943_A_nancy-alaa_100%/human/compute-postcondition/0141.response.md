Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The function returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function takes a series of test cases as input, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It processes these inputs and provides some form of output based on the specified conditions, though the exact nature of the output is not detailed in the provided information.
