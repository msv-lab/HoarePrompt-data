Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `first` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since the initial conditions specify that `first` is True and `mpp[i]` equals 1 when `i` is 0, the `break` statement will execute, breaking out of the loop or conditional block. The values of `i`, `n`, and `first` remain unchanged as no assignment operations are performed within the `break` statement itself.
