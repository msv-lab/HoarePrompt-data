Output State: **`first` is `False`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement causes the loop or if statement to terminate, but it does not change the values of the variables `first`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, or `mpp`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and the only change is that the loop or if statement is broken.
