The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `first` is `False`, `i` is `0`, and `n` is an input integer. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is not met if `mpp[i]` is equal to 1. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will continue as long as `mpp[0]` is not equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`first` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**
