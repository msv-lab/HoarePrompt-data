Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly defined as `n + 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, `i` will be `n + 1`.

Output: **n + 1**
