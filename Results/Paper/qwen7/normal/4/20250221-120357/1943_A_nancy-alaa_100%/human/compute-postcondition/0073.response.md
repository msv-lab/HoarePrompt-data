Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 but its exact value is not specified.
- There is a condition that if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `i` is 1, we need to check if 1 is in `mpp.keys()`.

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 1, and no other information about `mpp` is provided, we can conclude that the value of `i` when the `print(i)` statement is executed will be 1.

Output: **1**
