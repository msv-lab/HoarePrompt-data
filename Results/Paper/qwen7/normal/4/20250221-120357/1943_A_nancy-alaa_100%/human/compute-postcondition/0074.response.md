Output State: **`i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since the initial conditions state that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the `break` statement does not modify these values, the only change is that we exit the loop or conditional block.
