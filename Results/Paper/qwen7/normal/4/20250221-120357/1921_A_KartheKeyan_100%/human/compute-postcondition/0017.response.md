Output State: **`coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is 5, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and second tuple in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the squared distance between the third and second tuple in the list `coord`. Since `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, and `i` remains unchanged, the output state reflects these changes.
