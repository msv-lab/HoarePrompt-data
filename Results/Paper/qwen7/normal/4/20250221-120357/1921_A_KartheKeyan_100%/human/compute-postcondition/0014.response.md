Output State: **`coord` is a list containing four tuples: each tuple (x, y) consists of integers from the input split, `i` is 5.**

This means that after the loop has executed all 4 iterations, `coord` will contain four pairs of coordinates (x, y) that were entered as input. The variable `i` will be 5 because the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration, and it starts from 0.
