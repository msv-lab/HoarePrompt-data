Output State: **`i` is 4, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and second tuple in `coord`, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is not defined in the initial state, but the code `n -= 1` subtracts 1 from `n`. Since `n` is not mentioned elsewhere, we assume it was supposed to be `i` (which is initially 5). Therefore, `i` is now 4. The values of `p2` and `res` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.
