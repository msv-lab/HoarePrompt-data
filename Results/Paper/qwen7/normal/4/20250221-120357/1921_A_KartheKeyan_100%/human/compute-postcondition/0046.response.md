Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is `x - coord[2][0]`, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` is an empty list, so after appending `(x, y)`, `coord` contains one tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `p2`, `res`, and the updates to `x` and `y` are as described in the initial state.
