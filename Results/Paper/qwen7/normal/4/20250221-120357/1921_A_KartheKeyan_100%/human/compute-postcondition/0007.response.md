Output State: **`coord` is a list containing a tuple (x, y), where x and y are integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are integers from the input split, the list `coord` now contains one tuple with these values. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the initial state of `coord` being an empty list is updated to contain the new tuple.
