Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple (`x`, `y`), `p2` is `x - coord[2][0]`, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `i`, `n`, `coord`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` is still 4, `n` is still at least 3, `coord` is still a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` (where `x` and `y` are the new inputs), `p2` is updated to `x - coord[2][0]` (which is `x - x` since `coord[2][0]` is `x`), and `res` remains 0.
