Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`**

Explanation: The variable `max_item_idx` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables, `i` and `ans`, remain unchanged from their initial states. The function call `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)` is preserved as its value has not been altered by the code.
