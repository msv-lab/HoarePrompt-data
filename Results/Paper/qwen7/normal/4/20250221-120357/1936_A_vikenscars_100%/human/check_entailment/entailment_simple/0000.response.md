Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly prints a query in the required format and reads the response from the standard input. It returns the response string, which is used to determine the relationship between the bitwise OR operations.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The first loop aims to find the index of the largest element in the permutation by comparing `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx})` with `(p_i \mid p_i)` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx}) < (p_i \mid p_i)`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks the equality and inequality but does not consider the actual values of the elements. Instead, it should directly compare the values of `p_{max_item_idx}` and `p_i` using `func_1` to determine the larger one.
   
   - The second loop aims to find the index `j` such that `p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_j` is maximized. It iterates through all indices `i` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})` with `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)`. If `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) < (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`. If `(p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) == (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)`, it further checks `(p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})` with `(p_i \mid p_i)` to determine if `p_{pair_idx}` or `p_i` should be the new `pair_idx`. This part is logically sound but could be simplified.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly identify the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i \oplus p_j` is maximized. It incorrectly assumes that the maximum XOR can be found by comparing bitwise ORs, which is not sufficient. A more effective approach would involve comparing the actual values of the elements directly.

Given the flaws in the logic, the provided implementation does not guarantee finding the correct indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i \oplus p_j`.

Correctness: **False**
