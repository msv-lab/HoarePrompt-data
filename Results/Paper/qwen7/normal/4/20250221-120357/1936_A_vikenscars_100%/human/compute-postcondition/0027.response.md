Output State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, and `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` was called twice. The first call used the values `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i` as arguments, and its return value was stored in `ans1`. The second call used `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i` as arguments, and its return value was stored in `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
