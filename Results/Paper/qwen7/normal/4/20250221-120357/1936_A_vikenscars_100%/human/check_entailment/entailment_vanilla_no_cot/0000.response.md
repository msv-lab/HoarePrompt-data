Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Query Logic**: The function `func_2` is designed to find the index with the maximum bitwise OR value (`max_item_idx`). However, the logic for determining the pair `(max_item_idx, pair_idx)` that maximizes the XOR is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers pairs where both indices are the same, which is not sufficient to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

2. **Query Efficiency**: The program makes a series of queries to find the maximum OR value and then finds the pair with the maximum XOR. However, the approach to finding the pair with the maximum XOR is not optimal and does not guarantee the correct result within the allowed query limit.

3. **Incorrect XOR Pairing**: The program does not correctly identify the pair of indices that maximize the XOR value. It only checks a limited set of pairs and does not explore all possible pairs efficiently.

4. **Query Limit**: While the program attempts to stay within the 3n query limit, the logic for querying and determining the maximum XOR pair is not robust enough to ensure correctness under all conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as leveraging the properties of XOR and OR operations to efficiently identify the pair with the maximum XOR value. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.
