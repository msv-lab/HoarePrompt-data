Output State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0; `pair_idx` is 0**

Explanation: The code `pair_idx = max_item_idx` assigns the value of `max_item_idx` to `pair_idx`. Given the initial state, `max_item_idx` is either n-1 if the condition in the loop is met for every i from 1 to n-1, or it remains 0. Since the value of `max_item_idx` does not change during the assignment, `pair_idx` will take the same value as `max_item_idx`, which is 0 in both cases.
