Output State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is either 0 or unchanged, `i` is 1, and `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, pair_idx, 0, 1)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with arguments `max_item_idx` (which is 0), `pair_idx` (which is either 0 or unchanged), `max_item_idx` again (which is 0), and `i` (which is 1). The return value of this function call is stored in `ans1`. The other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
