Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 1 and n-1, the current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `n` remains greater than 1, `i` remains between 1 and `n-1`, and the condition that the current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1 still holds true. The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
