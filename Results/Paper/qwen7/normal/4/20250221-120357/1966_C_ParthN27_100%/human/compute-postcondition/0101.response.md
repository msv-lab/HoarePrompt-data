Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is either -1 or `n-2`, `s` is an empty set, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `s = set()` initializes an empty set named `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `total`, `i`, `ans`, `arr`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
