Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions checked within the loop, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2. The loop runs from 1 to `n-2` and does not break because `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` for all `i` from 1 to `n-2`; therefore, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s` without being toggled due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being met.**
