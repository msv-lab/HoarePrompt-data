Output State: **After sorting, the set `s` is converted to a sorted list, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers, and `s` is `[0] + s**.

This means that the sorted list `s` has had the value `0` prepended to it, while all other variables retain their previous values.
