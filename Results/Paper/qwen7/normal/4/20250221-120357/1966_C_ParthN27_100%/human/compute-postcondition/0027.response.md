Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, performing `1 ^ 1` results in 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
