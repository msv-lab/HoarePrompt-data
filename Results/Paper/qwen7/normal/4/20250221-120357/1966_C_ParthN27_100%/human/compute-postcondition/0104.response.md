The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` was added to the set `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`. The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given that `arr[i]` was added to the set `s` in the last iteration, we know that `i` was within the valid range of `n` and `i < n` was true. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be `i + 1` and it must still be less than `n`.

State: **`arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
