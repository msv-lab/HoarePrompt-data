Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2. The loop has completed its iterations, and the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was never met.**
