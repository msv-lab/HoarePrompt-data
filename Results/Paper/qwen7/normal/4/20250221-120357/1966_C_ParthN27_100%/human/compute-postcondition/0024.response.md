Output State: **Postcondition: `total` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` minus the current value of `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only causes the loop or conditional block it is within to exit. Therefore, all the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
