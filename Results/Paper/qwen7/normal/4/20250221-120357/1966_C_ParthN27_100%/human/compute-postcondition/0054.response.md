Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n-2`, `s` is a set containing `arr[n-2]`, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code adds the element at index `i` (which is `n-2`) of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is `n-2`, the set `s` now contains one element, which is `arr[n-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
