Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns information about the distribution of stones across piles based on the given input.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value details are not provided here as per the instruction to focus only on describing the parameters and return value without detailing how the function operates.
