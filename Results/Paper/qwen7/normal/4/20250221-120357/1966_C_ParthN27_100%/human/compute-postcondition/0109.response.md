Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers, and `s` is converted to a list.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(s)` converts the set `s` to a list. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
