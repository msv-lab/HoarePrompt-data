Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - `s` contains the element `arr[i]`.

2. **Loop Head**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, it means `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
   - `s` will contain the element `arr[i]` in the next iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
   - `s` will contain the element `arr[previous_i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `s` contains the element `arr[previous_i + 1]`**.
