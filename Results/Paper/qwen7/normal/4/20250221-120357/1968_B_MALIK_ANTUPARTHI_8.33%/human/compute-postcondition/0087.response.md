Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `k` is `j` + 1, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. The conditions involving `b`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` must still be greater than 0, `k` is now `j + 1`, and the condition that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` still holds true.
