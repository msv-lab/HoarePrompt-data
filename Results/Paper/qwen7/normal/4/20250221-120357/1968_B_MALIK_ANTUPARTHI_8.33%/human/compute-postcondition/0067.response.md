Output State: **`j` is 3, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `j` is 3, and `k` is initially set to `e.index(d[3]) + 1`. After executing `k = j + 1`, the value of `k` is updated to 4. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
