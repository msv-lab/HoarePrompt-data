Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to variables `b` and `c` respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
