Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `k` is an index.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an integer input from the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is the first integer input from the user.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `c` is the second integer input from the user.
   - `d` is the third integer input from the user.
   - `e` is an input from the user.
   - If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains as `j`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(b):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `b-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `b-1` (since the loop just finished its last iteration).

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `0`.
   - Therefore, the loop will start with `j = 0`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `k`, `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but no such modifications are mentioned.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be 0.
   - All other variables (`k`, `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user**.
