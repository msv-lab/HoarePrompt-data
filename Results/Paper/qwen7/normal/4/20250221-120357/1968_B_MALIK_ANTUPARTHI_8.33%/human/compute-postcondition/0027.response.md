Output State: **`k` is the index of `d[j]` in the list `e` plus 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the second integer input from the user, `j` is incremented by 1, `c` is the third integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of `d[j]` in the list `e` and adds 1 to it. This updates the value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
