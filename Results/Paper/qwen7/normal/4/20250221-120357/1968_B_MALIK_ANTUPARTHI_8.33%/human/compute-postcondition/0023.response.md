Output State: **`k` is equal to `j`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is unchanged, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user.**

The code `k = j` assigns the current value of `j` to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
