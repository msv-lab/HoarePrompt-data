Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the prefix of string `a` is not a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the function `func_1` only finds the first occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`, which may not be sufficient to ensure that the entire prefix of `a` forms a subsequence of `b`.

For example, consider the following input:
- `t = 1`
- `n = 3`, `m = 3`
- `a = "100"`
- `b = "110"`

In this case, the program will output `2`, because it finds the first '0' in `b` and increments the counter, but it does not check if the subsequent characters in `a` form a valid subsequence in `b`. The correct output should be `1`, as only the first character '1' of `a` forms a subsequence in `b`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that each character in the prefix of `a` is followed by the next character in the subsequence in `b`. This can be achieved by checking the characters one by one and ensuring they match in order.
