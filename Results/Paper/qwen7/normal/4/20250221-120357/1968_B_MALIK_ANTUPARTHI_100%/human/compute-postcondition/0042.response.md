Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0 (initial value).
   - `a` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (unchanged).
   - `a` is an integer input from the user (unchanged).
   - `i` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `b` is an integer input from the user (unchanged).
   - `c` is an integer input from the user (unchanged).
   - `d` is a string input from the user (unchanged).
   - `e` is a string input from the user (unchanged).
   - `j` is `b` (unchanged).
   - `k` is `b + 1` or `b` if `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and the loop breaks when `j` reaches `b - 1`, otherwise `k` will be `b` and the loop will break without reaching `c`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

6. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an integer input from the user.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` is an integer input from the user.
   - `c` is an integer input from the user.
   - `d` is a string input from the user.
   - `e` is a string input from the user.
   - `j` is `b`.
   - `k` is `b + 1` or `b` depending on the conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b + 1` or `b`**.
