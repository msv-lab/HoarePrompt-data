Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is `b + 1`.
   - `k` is `j + 1`.
   - The loop condition for the `for` loop is `j < b`.

2. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < b`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - Since `j` is `b + 1`, the current value of `j` is `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` is not less than `b` (since `b + 1` is not less than `b`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Because `j` is `b + 1`, the loop condition `j < b` is false.
   - Hence, the loop will not execute again.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - No adjustment is needed for `j` since it cannot change within the loop.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted because the loop will not execute again due to the loop condition failing.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`b` is a positive integer, `j` is `b + 1`, and `k` is `j + 1`.**
