Output State: **`b` is greater than 0, `j` is `b`, `k` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: Initially, `j` is equal to `b`, and `k` is calculated as `k + e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1`. After that, the code updates `k` to be `j + 1`. Therefore, `j` remains `b`, and `k` is now `b + 1`. The condition that `b` is greater than 0 remains unchanged.
