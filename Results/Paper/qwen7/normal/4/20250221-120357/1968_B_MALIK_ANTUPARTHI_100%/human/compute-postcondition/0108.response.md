Output State: **`b` is a positive integer, `j` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `b`, `j`, and `k`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the values of `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
