Postcondition: `b` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `b`. After executing the if-else block, either `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, or `k` and `j` are both set to `b`, depending on whether the condition `d[j] in e[k:]` is true or false. Additionally, in both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
