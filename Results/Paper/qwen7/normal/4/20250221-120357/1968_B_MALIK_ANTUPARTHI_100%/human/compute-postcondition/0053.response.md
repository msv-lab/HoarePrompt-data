Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the hypothetical loop or conditional block where `k` was being updated. The values of `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block.
