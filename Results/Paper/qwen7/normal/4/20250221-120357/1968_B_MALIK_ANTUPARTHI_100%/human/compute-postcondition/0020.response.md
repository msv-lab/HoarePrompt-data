Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(b)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `b`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is an integer input from the user
   - `i` is 0
   - `b` is an integer input from the user
   - `c` is an integer input from the user
   - `d` is a string input from the user
   - `e` is a string input from the user
   - `k` is either updated to `j + 1` or remains `j`
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the character at index `j` in `d` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `k` remains `j`.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `j < b`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`.
   - `b` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `e` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged because the loop condition for `k` is not specified to change in the next iteration based on the given information.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `k` is either updated to `j + 1` or remains `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
