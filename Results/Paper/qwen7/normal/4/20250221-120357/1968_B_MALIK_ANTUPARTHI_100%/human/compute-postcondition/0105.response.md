Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `j`. The loop iterates from `0` to `b-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < b`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is equal to `b` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Analyze the Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that after executing the if-else block, `j` could either stay the same, increment by 1, or reset to `b` based on certain conditions.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is equal to `b` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `b`.
   - Therefore, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become `b + 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`b` is a positive integer, `j` is `b + 1`**.
