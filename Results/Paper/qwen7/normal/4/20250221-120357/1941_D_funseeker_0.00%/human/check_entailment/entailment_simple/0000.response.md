### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Returns an integer value obtained from `func_1()`. This function is used to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_3()`: Returns a list of integers obtained by converting the split result of the output of `func_1()` into integers. This function is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - The function `func_4()` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions of the ball based on the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or '?' indicating either direction).
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that the value `0` (which would indicate an invalid position) is removed from `ans` and replaced with `n` (since the positions are taken modulo `n`).
   - Finally, it prints the size of `ans` and the elements of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_4()` correctly handles both clockwise (`'0'`) and counterclockwise (`'1'`) throws, as well as unknown directions (`'?'`).
   - The use of sets ensures that only unique positions are stored, which is necessary since the ball cannot occupy the same position more than once.
   - The replacement of `0` with `n` ensures that the positions are always within the valid range `[1, n]`.
   - The final output matches the required format: the number of possible positions followed by the positions themselves.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
