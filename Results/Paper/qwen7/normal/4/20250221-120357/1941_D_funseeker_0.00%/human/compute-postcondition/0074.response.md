Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute, `q` must be an element of `ans`. Since the postcondition states that `ans` contains at least one element, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `ans`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`ans`**: Since the loop continues as long as `ans` contains elements, `ans` will have at least one element at the start of each iteration. However, since we are starting from the state after the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `ans` still contains at least one element.
   - **`q`**: The variable `q` will take on the value of each element in `ans` during each iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

4. **Given Information at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` contains at least one element.
   - `c` is either '1' or '?'.
   - `temp` contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

5. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ans` contains at least one element, it will still contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration.
   - The next value of `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ans` still contains at least one element.
- `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
- `c` remains either '1' or '?'.
- `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for the new value of `q`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', and `temp` contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
