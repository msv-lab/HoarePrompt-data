Output State: **`c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements where each element is `(q + r) % n` and now also includes `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` originally contained elements where each element was `(q + r) % n`, after executing the line `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, `temp` now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The variable `c` remains unchanged and can still be either '1' or '?'.
