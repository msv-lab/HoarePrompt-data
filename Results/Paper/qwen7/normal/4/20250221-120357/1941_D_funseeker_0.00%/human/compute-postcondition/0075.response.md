Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`, and `temp` does not contain `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. Since `temp` originally contained both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, after executing the code, `(q - r) % n` is removed from `temp`, leaving only `(q + r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
