Output State: **`ans` is empty, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains all unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values generated during the iterations, and `m` has been decremented by the total number of iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will be empty since each iteration removes an element from `ans`. The variable `c` remains either '1' or '?' as it does not change within the loop body. The variable `m` is decremented by the total number of iterations, which is the length of the initial `ans`. The set `temp` accumulates all unique results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans` during the iterations.
