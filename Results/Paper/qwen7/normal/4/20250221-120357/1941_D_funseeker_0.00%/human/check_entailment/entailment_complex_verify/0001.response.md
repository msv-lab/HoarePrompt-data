### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The provided code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`). These functions are used to read input from stdin, handle integer and list inputs, and parse the input data for the main function.
   
2. **Main Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is `?`, both clockwise and counterclockwise positions are considered.
   - After processing all throws, it adjusts the set to ensure it only contains valid player numbers (i.e., between 1 and `n`).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the modulo operation to wrap around the circle.
   - It correctly discards position `0` and adds `n` when necessary.
   - The logic for handling `?` in the direction ensures all possible directions are considered.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the number of possible players followed by their indices in sorted order.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

- **Modulo Operation**: The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handles the circular nature of the players.
- **Handling `?`**: The condition `if c == '?'` ensures that both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities are considered.
- **Set Operations**: Using a set to store possible positions ensures that all unique positions are tracked.
- **Output Format**: The final output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: True**
