Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `q` which is taken from the list `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains at least one element.
   - `q` is the next element in `ans`.
   - `c` is either '1' or '?'.
   - `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and also contains `(q - r) % n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `ans` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the next element in `ans`, after processing `q`, `q` will no longer be in `ans`.
   - `ans` will lose the current value of `q`.
   - `temp` will still contain the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` because these calculations are done outside the loop and do not change with each iteration.
   - `c` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, we assume it stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` will now contain all elements except the current `q`.
   - `q` will be the next element in `ans` after the current iteration.
   - `c` remains either '1' or '?'.
   - `temp` retains its values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `ans` contains at least one element (excluding the current `q`), `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
