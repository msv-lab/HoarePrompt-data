Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` contains all possible unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values for all initial elements in `ans` after `m` iterations.
- `c` is either '1' or '?'.
- `m` is 0.
- `ans` does not contain the value `0`.

When `m` is 0, there are no iterations performed, so the `ans` list remains unchanged from its initial state. Since `ans` does not contain the value `0` initially, it will still not contain `0` after `m` iterations.

Therefore, the length of `ans` will be the same as its initial length.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the initial length of ans without containing the value 0)**
