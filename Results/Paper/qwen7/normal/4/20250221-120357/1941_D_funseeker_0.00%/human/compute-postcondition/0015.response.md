Output State: **`c` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `q` changes to the next element in `ans`; `temp` contains the element `(q_prev + r) % n` where `q_prev` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation:
- `c` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `q` is updated to the next element in `ans`.
- `temp` is updated to include the element `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is the value of `q` from the previous iteration (`q_prev`).
