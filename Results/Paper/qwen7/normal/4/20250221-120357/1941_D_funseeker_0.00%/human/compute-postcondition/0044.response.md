Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved here are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `ans` list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`.
   - `c` remains the same as its initial value.
   - `q` is the first element in `ans`.
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is being used in the loop, it will be the next element in `ans` after the current iteration.
   - `ans` will lose the current `q` since it has been processed.
   - `r` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `r` remains the same.
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
   - `ans` will have at least one less element (the current `q` is removed).
   - `temp` will be updated based on the new `q`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

However, to fit the exact format required:

State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
