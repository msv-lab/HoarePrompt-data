Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is an integer value converted from the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements where each element is either `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged with elements where each element is `(q + r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `c` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `q` changes to the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged with each element being `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` remains the same, `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n`, whether `c` is '1' or '?'.

This means that regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?', the final state of `c`, `q`, and `temp` will be such that `temp` holds the value `(q - r) % n`, while `c` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
