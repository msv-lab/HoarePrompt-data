Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to 0. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The value of `pos` remains unchanged unless `arr[1]` equals `k`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and if `arr[1]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to 0. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.**
