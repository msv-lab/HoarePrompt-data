Postcondition: `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is updated to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid` if `arr[mid]` <= `k`, and `high` is set to `mid`. `mid` is always updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2, and `st` is a set containing the value of (`low` + (`high` - 1)) // 2, and `st` now includes the value of `mid`.
