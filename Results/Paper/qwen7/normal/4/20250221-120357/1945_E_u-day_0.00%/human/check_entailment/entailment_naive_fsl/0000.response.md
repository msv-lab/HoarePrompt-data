Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search algorithm should be applied to a sorted array, but the given implementation assumes the array is already sorted and does not sort the array before performing the search. This means the program will not work correctly for permutations that are not already sorted.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```

The correct approach would be to sort the array before performing the binary search. However, the provided code does not include any sorting step. As a result, the binary search will not find the correct position of `x` in the unsorted array.

To fix this, the code should include a sorting step before performing the binary search. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    # Sort the array
    arr.sort()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is sorted before performing the binary search, which aligns with the problem description.
