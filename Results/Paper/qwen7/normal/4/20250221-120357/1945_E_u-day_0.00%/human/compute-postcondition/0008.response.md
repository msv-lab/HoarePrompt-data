Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, we can update the state as follows:

- `i` will be 1 (since it was 0 before and is incremented by 1).
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
