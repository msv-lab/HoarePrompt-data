Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2**.

Explanation: Initially, `mid` was calculated as `(0 + (high - 1)) // 2`. This value is added to the set `st`. Then, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
