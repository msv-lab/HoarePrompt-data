Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element at the left pointer `l` is equal to `x`.
2. The given code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation before performing the binary search.
3. The function `func_3` performs a binary search directly on the given permutation without any modifications. It does not consider the requirement to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps.
4. The output format also does not match the expected output. Instead of printing the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, it prints 0, 1, or the indices of the binary search.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
