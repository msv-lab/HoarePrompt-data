### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in `func_3()` does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The function does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the start of the permutation after at most 2 swaps.
3. **No Swaps**: The program does not modify the permutation to achieve the required condition for binary search.

However, the original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search. This conclusion is accurate based on the provided function summary and the problem requirements.

The function summary indicates that the function `func_3()` is supposed to perform a binary search and print the number of swaps needed along with the indices of the swaps. But the actual implementation does not perform these swaps, which means the function does not meet the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution as it fails to perform the necessary swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

**Final: False**
