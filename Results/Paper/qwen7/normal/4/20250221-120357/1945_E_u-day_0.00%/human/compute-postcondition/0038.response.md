Postcondition: `low`, `high`, and `mid` are updated such that if `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` remains greater than 1. The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` and `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`.
