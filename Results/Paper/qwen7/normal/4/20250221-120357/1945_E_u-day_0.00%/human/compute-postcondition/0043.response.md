Output State: **`low` is updated to `mid`, `high` is set to `mid` if `arr[mid]` <= `k`, otherwise it is set to `mid`, `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2, and `st` is a set containing the value of (`low` + (`high` - 1)) // 2, and `st` now includes the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `low` to `mid`. The values of `high` and `mid` remain unchanged from their previous conditions. The value of `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2. The set `st` contains the value of (`low` + (`high` - 1)) // 2 and now includes the new value of `mid`.
