Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` are as follows: if `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `mid`, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`.
