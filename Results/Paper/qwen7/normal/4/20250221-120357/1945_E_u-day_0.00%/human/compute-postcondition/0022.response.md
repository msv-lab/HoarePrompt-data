Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, `mid` becomes `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged from their initial state.
