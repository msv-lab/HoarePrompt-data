Output State: **`low` is updated to `mid` if `arr[mid]` <= `k`, otherwise it is set to 0; `high` is set to `mid`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `st` is a set containing the value of (`low` + (`high` - 1)) // 2, and `st` now includes the value of `mid`; `high` is now equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be the same as `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
