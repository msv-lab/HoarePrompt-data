Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at the starting position \(l\).
2. The provided code does not actually perform the necessary swaps to achieve the desired result. Instead, it performs a binary search on the given permutation without making any changes to it.
3. Function `func_3` attempts to perform a binary search on the permutation and checks if the target value \(x\) is present. If \(x\) is not found, it incorrectly prints the index where \(x\) should be inserted and the index of the first occurrence of \(x\) (or -1 if not found).
4. The function does not provide any mechanism to swap elements in the permutation to ensure the binary search will find \(x\) at the start.
5. Given the problem constraints and the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps, the current implementation does not meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at the start.

Correctness: **False**
