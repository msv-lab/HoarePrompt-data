Output State: **`low` is updated to mid if arr[mid] <= k, otherwise it is set to 0; `high` is set to mid if arr[mid] <= k, otherwise it is set to mid; `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2; `st` is a set containing the value of (low + (high - 1)) // 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to `(low + high) // 2`. Depending on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` and `high` are updated accordingly. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` remains greater than `low + 1`. The value of `mid` is recalculated, and `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`.
