Output State: **The final state of the loop will have `low` equal to `high` or `low + 1` equal to `high`, indicating the search range has been narrowed down as much as possible. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop.**

In this final state, the variable `low` will either be equal to `high` (indicating the search range has been exhausted without finding an element that satisfies the condition `arr[mid] > k`), or `low + 1` will be equal to `high` (indicating the last midpoint was calculated but the exact position where `arr[mid] > k` might still need further checking). The set `st` will contain all the unique midpoints that were added during the iterations of the loop.
