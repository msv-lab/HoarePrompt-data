Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.**

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new assignment of `arr` to the return value of `func_2()`.
