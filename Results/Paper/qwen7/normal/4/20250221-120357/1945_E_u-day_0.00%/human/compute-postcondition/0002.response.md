Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `pos` is -1.**

The code initializes the variable `pos` to -1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions while updating `pos` to -1.
