Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, it attempts to find the position of `k` in the array using binary search, but it does not ensure that the array is rearranged with only up to two swaps to make `p_l` equal to `x`. Instead, it prints the index of the element found in the binary search along with its position, which does not solve the problem as stated.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the positions of `x` and another element that can be swapped to place `x` at the start of the array, ensuring that only up to two swaps are made. The current implementation does not achieve this.
