You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: Postcondition: `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, with each input as a separate element. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`. `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`. The variable `i` is equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `n` is the final length of the list `a`, which is determined by the number of test cases provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an n × m grid where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. It constructs a list of these grids, along with strings representing the first and last characters of each row. The function then checks if the first row of any grid is uniform and different from the last row of that grid, or if the first character of each row is uniform and different from the last character of each row. If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines representing the grid, storing each line in the list `a`.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - It constructs `first_row` by taking the first character from each row.
   - It constructs `last_row` by taking the last character from each row.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the first row (`a[0]`) is uniform but different from the last row (`a[-1]`). If this condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column (`first_row`) is uniform but different from the last column (`last_row`). If this condition is true, it also prints "NO".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

#### Condition 1: `a[0]` is uniform but different from `a[-1]`
- This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color but different from the last row. If this happens, it means there is no way to make the entire grid one color using the allowed operations because the first and last rows are different and uniform.

#### Condition 2: `first_row` is uniform but different from `last_row`
- This condition checks if the first column is entirely one color but different from the last column. Similar to the first condition, if this happens, it means there is no way to make the entire grid one color using the allowed operations because the first and last columns are different and uniform.

#### General Case: Both Conditions Fail
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that either the entire grid is uniform or there is a way to make it uniform through the allowed operations. Hence, the program prints "YES".

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies when it is impossible to make all squares the same color by checking if the first and last rows or columns are uniform and different. If such a situation is detected, it correctly outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Thus, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.
