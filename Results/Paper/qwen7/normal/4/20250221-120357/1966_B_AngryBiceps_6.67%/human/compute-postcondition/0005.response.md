Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, the loop starts with `i` set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `m` is an integer entered by the user (not directly relevant to the loop).
- `_` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq _ \leq 10^4\) (not directly relevant to the loop).
- `a` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the loop).
- `first_row` is an empty string (not directly relevant to the loop).
- `last_row` is an empty string (not directly relevant to the loop).

The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0

So, the final state is:
**`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
