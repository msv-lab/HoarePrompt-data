Output State: **`a` is a list with an additional input value appended to it, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the sum of its previous value and the last element of the last list in `a`, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the last list in `a`, and `first_row` is increased by the first element of the last list in `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding the first element of the last list in `a` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
