Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `_` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ _ ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `first_row`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `_`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `first_row` is simply set to an empty string.
