Output State: **`a` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user; `first_row` is the sum of the original first element of the input and the first element of the only list in `a`; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`; `i` is 1; `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` adds the first element of the only list in `a` (which is the new input from the user) to `first_row`. The other variables remain unchanged.
