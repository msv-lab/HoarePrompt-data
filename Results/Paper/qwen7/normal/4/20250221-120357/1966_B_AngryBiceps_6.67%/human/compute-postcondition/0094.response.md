Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an n Ã— m grid where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. It constructs a list of these grids, along with strings representing the first and last characters of each row. The function then checks if the first row of any grid is uniform and different from the last row of that grid, or if the first character of each row is uniform and different from the last character of each row. If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.**
