Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop variable `_` (which is just an underscore, indicating it's not used) will iterate from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` will be -1 (postcondition given).
   - `n` will be the final length of the list `a`.
   - `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user.
   - `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`.
   - `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.
   - The first row (`first_row`) consists of identical elements if and only if the length of the set of `first_row` is 1.
   - The first row is not equal to the last row (`last_row`).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations remaining should be positive. Since the loop runs `int(input())` times, the loop will run again if `int(input()) > 0`.
   - Therefore, the value of `n` (the final length of the list `a`) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will still be -1 because the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect `i`.
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user, but since no new input is added in the loop body, its state remains the same.
- `first_row` and `last_row` will remain the same as they are derived from `a` and do not change within the loop unless the loop body modifies them, which it doesn't based on the given information.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: `i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user, `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.**
