Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` contains an input value
   - `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last list in `a`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `a` is not modified within the loop, so its state remains the same.
   - `last_row` is not directly affected by the loop itself, but if it was updated inside the loop, it would need to be adjusted accordingly. However, based on the given information, it is not mentioned that `last_row` is updated in each iteration, so we assume it remains the same.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is set to 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `last_row` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` contains an input value, `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the last list in `a`**
