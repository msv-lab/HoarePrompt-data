Output State: **`a` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user; `first_row` is the sum of the original first element of the input and the first element of the only list in `a`; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a` plus the last element of the only list in `a`; `i` is 1; `n` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` adds the last element of the only list in `a` to `last_row`.
- Since `a` is a list with two elements, and the last element of the only list in `a` is the last element of the only list in `a`, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`.
