Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as an n × m matrix where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. Each element in the grid is either 'W' or 'B'. The function returns information about the grid based on the given constraints, including the dimensions n and m, and the elements 'W' and 'B'.**

This means the function is designed to take a grid (matrix) as input indirectly through the parameters `n` and `m`, which define the dimensions of the grid, and the elements within the grid, which are either 'W' or 'B'. The function then processes this grid according to the specified constraints and returns relevant information about it.
