Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is used to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the input value provided by `int(input())`. This means that the loop will run as long as the input value is a positive integer.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input value for the loop should be within this range.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input value (which will be assigned to `_` in the loop) is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State after adjustment**:
- The input value must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the input value must be a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`_` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ _ ≤ 10^4**
