Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` updates the value of `first_row` by adding the first element of the only element in the list `a` to the current value of `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is now equal to that input. All other variables remain unchanged.
