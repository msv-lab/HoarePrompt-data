Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to -1.
- `n` is the final length of the list `a`.
- `a` contains all the inputs provided by the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the first element of each list in `a` is identical, and the length of the set of `first_row` is 1, which means `first_row` consists of only one unique character repeated for each list in `a`. Also, `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
