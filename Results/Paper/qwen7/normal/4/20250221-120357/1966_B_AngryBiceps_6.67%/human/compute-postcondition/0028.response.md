Postcondition: `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, with each input as a separate element. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`. `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`. The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `n` remains the same as it was initially. Additionally, either the first element of `a` consists of at least one unique character, or the first and last elements of `a` are the same, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row` if the if condition is true, otherwise, the first element of `a` does not consist of all the same characters, or the first and last elements of `a` are the same.
