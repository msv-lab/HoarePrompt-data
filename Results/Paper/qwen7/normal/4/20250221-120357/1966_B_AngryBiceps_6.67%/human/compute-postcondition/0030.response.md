Output State: **`a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`, the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the new length of `a`, `m` is an integer input by the user, and `n, m` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

This means that after executing the code, the user is expected to input two integers separated by a space, which are then split and assigned to `n` and `m`. The values of `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
