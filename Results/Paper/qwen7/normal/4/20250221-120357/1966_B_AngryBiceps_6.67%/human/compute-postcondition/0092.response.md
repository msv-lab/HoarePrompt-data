Output State: **Postcondition: `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, with each input as a separate element. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`. `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`. The variable `i` is equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `n` is the final length of the list `a`, which is determined by the number of test cases provided.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will contain all the input grids provided by the user, `first_row` will be constructed from the first characters of each grid, and `last_row` will be constructed from the last characters of each grid. The variable `i` will be `-1`, signifying that the loop has ended, and `n` will reflect the total number of test cases processed.
