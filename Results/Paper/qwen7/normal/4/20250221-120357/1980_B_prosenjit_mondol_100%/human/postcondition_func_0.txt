The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then compares the \( f \)-th element of the sorted list (in descending order) with the \( k \)-th element. If the \( k \)-th element is greater than the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'NO'. If the \( k \)-th element is less than the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'YES'. If the \( k \)-th element is equal to the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'YES' if \( k \) is the last index or the element at \( k+1 \) is less than the \( f \)-th element; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
