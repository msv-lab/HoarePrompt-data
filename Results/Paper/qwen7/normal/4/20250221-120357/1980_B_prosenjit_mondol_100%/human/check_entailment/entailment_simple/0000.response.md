Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed.
3. It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes.
4. The function sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
5. It compares the value of the `k`-th element in the sorted list with the value of the originally `f`-th cube.
   - If the `k`-th element is greater than the original value of the `f`-th cube, the favorite cube is not removed, so it prints "NO".
   - If the `k`-th element is less than the original value of the `f`-th cube, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints "YES".
   - If the `k`-th element is equal to the original value of the `f`-th cube, it checks further conditions:
     - If `k` is the last element in the sorted list (`k == n - 1`), the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it checks if the `(k+1)`-th element is less than the original value of the `f`-th cube. If true, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE".

Given the logic and the provided examples, the function correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
