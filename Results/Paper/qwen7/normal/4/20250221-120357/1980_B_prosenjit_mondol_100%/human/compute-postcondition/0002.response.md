Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the third integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `f` is decremented by 1, so `f` is now 1 less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
