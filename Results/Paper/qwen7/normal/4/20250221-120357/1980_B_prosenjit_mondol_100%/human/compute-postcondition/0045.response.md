Output State: **t** is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), **n** is the first integer entered by the user, **f** is the second integer entered by the user minus 1, **k** is the third integer entered by the user minus 2, **a** is a list of **n** integers sorted in descending order, **x** is the element at index **f** in list **a**. After executing the if-else block, if **a[k]** is greater than **x**, it prints 'NO'. If **a[k]** is less than **x**, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if **k** equals **n - 1** or **a[k + 1]** is less than **x**, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final state will reflect the last set of inputs provided to the loop.

The loop processes each test case individually, updating **n**, **f**, **k**, and **a** for each new set of inputs but does not affect the previous test cases. Therefore, the final output state will be based on the last set of inputs provided to the loop.
