Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 2 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 2, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is a list with three elements converted from input, `x[0]` is the element at index 0 of list `a` at index `f`. If `a[k] < x[0]` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
