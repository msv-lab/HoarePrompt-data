Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user minus 1, `a` is a list containing three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. After executing the if-else block, `a[k]` remains unchanged, and `x` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 2 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 2, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is a list with three elements converted from input, `x[0]` is the element at index 0 of list `a` at index `f`. No changes are made in either case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is the second integer entered by the user minus 1, `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 2, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is a list with three elements converted from input, `x[0]` is now equal to the element at index `f` of list `a`, `a` is updated with three integers converted from input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
