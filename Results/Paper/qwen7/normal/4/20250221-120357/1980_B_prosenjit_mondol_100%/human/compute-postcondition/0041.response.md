Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `f` is the second integer entered by the user minus 1, so `f = n - 1`.
- `k` is the second integer entered by the user minus 2, so `k = n - 2`.
- `a` is a list of three integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is a list with three elements converted from input.
- `x[0]` is now equal to the element at index `f` of list `a`, so `x[0] = a[f]`.
- `a` is updated with three integers converted from input.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
