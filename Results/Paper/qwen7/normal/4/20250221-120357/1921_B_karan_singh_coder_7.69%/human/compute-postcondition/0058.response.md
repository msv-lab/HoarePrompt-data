Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is `n`
- `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`
- `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`
- `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`
- `s` is the newly input string
- `t` is the newly input string
- `n` must be a non-negative integer
- `i` is `n-1`
- The condition `s1` is equal to `t1` holds true

We need to evaluate the expression `s1 if cnt else 0`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `cnt` is `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `cnt` is a non-negative integer.
2. The condition `s1 == t1` is given to be true, so `s1` and `t1` are equal.
3. The expression `s1 if cnt else 0` checks if `cnt` is truthy. Since `cnt` is `n` and `n` is a non-negative integer, `cnt` is truthy.
4. Therefore, the expression evaluates to `s1`.

Since `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, and it is given that `s1` is equal to `t1`, the value of `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.

Output: **s1 (where s1 is the number of '1's in the newly input string s)**
