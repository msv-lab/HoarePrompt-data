Output State: **`i` is 8, `cnt` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 if `s[8]` is not equal to `t[8]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index `i` (which is 8) in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Since the exact values of `s` and `t` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`. However, we know that `i` remains 8, and `cnt` has been updated based on the condition.
