Output State: **`cnt` is 6, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is equal to 4, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 8, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `s1` (the number of '1's in the string `s`) and `t1` (the number of '1's in the string `t`). The variable `d` is assigned this value. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
