Output State: `cnt` is 6, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is equal to 4, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 4.

This output state is calculated based on the given information. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop executes 3 times, `cnt` is 4. Since the loop increments `cnt` by 1 each time `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, and we know that the loop has executed 3 times so far, it means there were 2 more instances where `s[i]` was not equal to `t[i]` in the remaining part of the loop. Therefore, when the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to 3), `cnt` will be incremented one more time for each of these 2 additional instances, making the total `cnt` value 6. The value of `n` must be 4 for the loop to run exactly 4 times, and `i` will be 4 after the last iteration of the loop.
