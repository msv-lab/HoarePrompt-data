Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` checks if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different. Since `i` was initially 1, and now it has been incremented, `i` is now 2. If the characters at index 2 of `s` and `t` are different, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially 1, it becomes 2 after the operation. The values of `t1`, `s1`, `d`, `s`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
