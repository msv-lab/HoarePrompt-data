Postcondition: **`cnt` is `n`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1`, and the condition `s1` is equal to `t1` holds true.**
