Output State: **`cnt` is 6, `s1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the newly input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 8, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `t` is the newly input string**.

Explanation: The code `t = input()` reads a new string from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of the other variables (`cnt`, `s1`, `n`, `s`, `t1`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
