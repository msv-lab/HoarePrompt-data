You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate through each test case provided by the input. For each test case, the following conditions will be checked and actions performed:
    #
    #1. Count the number of '1's in the strings `s` and `t` (denoted as `s1` and `t1` respectively).
    #2. Calculate the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ (denoted as `cnt`).
    #3. If `s1` equals `t1`, the output will be `s1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise, it will be `0`.
    #4. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, calculate the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` (denoted as `d`), and then compute the final output as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be determined based on the last test case processed. Specifically, the output will be either the count of '1's in the final string `s` (`s1`), adjusted according to whether the counts of '1's in `s` and `t` are equal or not, as described above.
    #
    #The exact numerical value of the output cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each test case, but the process described above will be followed for each one.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s`, and the target state of the boxes `t`.

2. **Counting Cats in Initial and Target States:**
   - `s1` counts the number of cats in the initial state (`s`).
   - `t1` counts the number of cats in the target state (`t`).

3. **Calculating the Number of Boxes that Need to Change:**
   - `cnt` counts the number of boxes that need to change their state (i.e., the number of positions where `s[i]` is different from `t[i]`).

4. **Determining the Minimum Operations:**
   - If the number of cats in the initial state is equal to the number of cats in the target state (`s1 == t1`), the minimum operations required are simply `cnt` if `cnt` is even (since moving a cat from one box to another doesn't change the total count of cats). If `cnt` is odd, it means an extra operation is needed to balance the counts.
   - If the number of cats in the initial state is not equal to the number of cats in the target state, the difference `d` is calculated as `abs(s1 - t1)`. The number of operations required is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Case 1: `s1 == t1`**
  - If the number of cats is the same in both states, the operations are purely about moving cats between boxes without changing the total count.
  - If `cnt` is even, no additional operations are needed beyond the moves to align the boxes.
  - If `cnt` is odd, one more operation is needed to balance the counts.

- **Case 2: `s1 != t1`**
  - If the number of cats differs, we need to account for the difference in counts.
  - The formula `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` ensures that we handle the moves correctly, accounting for the difference in the number of cats.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `s = "10010"`
   - `t = "00001"`
   - `s1 = 2`, `t1 = 1`
   - `cnt = 4`
   - Since `s1 != t1`, `d = 1`
   - Operations required: `(4 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 2`

2. **Example 2:**
   - `n = 1`
   - `s = "1"`
   - `t = "1"`
   - `s1 = 1`, `t1 = 1`
   - `cnt = 0`
   - Since `s1 == t1`, no operations are needed.

3. **Example 3:**
   - `n = 3`
   - `s = "000"`
   - `t = "111"`
   - `s1 = 0`, `t1 = 3`
   - `cnt = 3`
   - Since `s1 != t1`, `d = 3`
   - Operations required: `(3 - 3) // 2 + 3 = 3`

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the target state based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
