Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the constraints, the input value (let's call it `t`) must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
