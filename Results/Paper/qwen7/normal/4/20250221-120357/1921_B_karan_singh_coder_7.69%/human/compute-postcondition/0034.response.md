Output State: `i` is 8 + n, `cnt` is the number of positions from 0 to n-1 where the characters in `s` and `t` differ.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will retain its initial value of 8 because it is not modified within the loop body. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions from 0 to n-1 where the corresponding characters in strings `s` and `t` are different. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop ran, which is `n`.
