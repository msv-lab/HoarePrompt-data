Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` remains `0`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` remains `0`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])` to `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `diff2` is now equal to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and the element at index `tp2` in the list `b`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
