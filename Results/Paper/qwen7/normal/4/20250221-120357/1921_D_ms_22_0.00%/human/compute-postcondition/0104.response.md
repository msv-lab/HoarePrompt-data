Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is empty, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `b`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
