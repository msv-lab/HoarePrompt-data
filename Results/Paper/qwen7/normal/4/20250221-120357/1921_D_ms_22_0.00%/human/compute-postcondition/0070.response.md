Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`; `ans` is `ans + diff2`.**

The code `ans += diff2` increments the value of `ans` by `diff2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
