Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each item popped from `max_heap`, the code updates `ans` by adding either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`. Additionally, `tp1` will be incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, and `tp2` will be decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`.

In summary, `ans` will contain the total accumulated cost based on the specified conditions, and `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described.
