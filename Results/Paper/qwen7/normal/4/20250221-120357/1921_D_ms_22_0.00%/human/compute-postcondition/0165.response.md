Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1] and `b[tp2]`.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `diff1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, while `diff2` remains the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The state of `max_heap` and the value of `item` also remain unchanged.
