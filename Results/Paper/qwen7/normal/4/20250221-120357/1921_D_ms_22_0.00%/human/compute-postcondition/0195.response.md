Output State: The `max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the sum of the maximum differences encountered during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted according to the conditions specified in the loop body, and the loop has processed all items in the `max_heap`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the `max_heap` will be empty because all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum differences calculated during each iteration. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` will reflect the final positions they reached based on the conditions in the loop body, indicating how the algorithm progressed through the elements of the lists `a` and `b`.
