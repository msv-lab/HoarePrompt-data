Output State: **`tp1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

The code assigns the value of `m - 1` to `tp2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
