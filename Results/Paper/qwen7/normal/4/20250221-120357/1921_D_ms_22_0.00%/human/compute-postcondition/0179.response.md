Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater, if `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops the highest priority element from `max_heap` and assigns it to `item`. This means `max_heap` no longer contains `item`. The other conditions related to `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2` remain unchanged because they were not directly affected by the operation.
