Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2]) + ans`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` is either `1` or `0`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated according to the if-else condition, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
