Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, the loop processes the highest remaining item in `max_heap`, updates `ans` by adding either the negative value of the item's first element, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`. Depending on the conditions met, `tp1` may be incremented by 1 or `tp2` may be decremented by 1. The process continues until `max_heap` is empty, at which point `ans` contains the final accumulated value representing the sum of these differences.
