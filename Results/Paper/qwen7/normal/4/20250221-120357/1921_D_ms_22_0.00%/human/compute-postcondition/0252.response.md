Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[1])` where `item[1]` is the element popped from `max_heap` and `item[2]` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which element of `b` was closer to the popped element, `tp1` is `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`.**

Explanation: The line `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Initially, `tp1` is `0`, so after executing this line, `tp1` becomes `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
