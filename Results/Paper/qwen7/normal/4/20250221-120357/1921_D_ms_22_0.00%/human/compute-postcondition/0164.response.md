Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

In this output state, the variable `diff2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
