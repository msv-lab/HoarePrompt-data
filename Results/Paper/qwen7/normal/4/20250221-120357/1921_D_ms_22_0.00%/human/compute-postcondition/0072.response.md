Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` or `b[tp2 - 1]` depending on the condition; `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `diff2`.
