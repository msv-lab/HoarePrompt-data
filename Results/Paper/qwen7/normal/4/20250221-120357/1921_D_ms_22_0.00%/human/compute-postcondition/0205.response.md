Output State: **`tp1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `tp1 = 0` initializes `tp1` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their states. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
