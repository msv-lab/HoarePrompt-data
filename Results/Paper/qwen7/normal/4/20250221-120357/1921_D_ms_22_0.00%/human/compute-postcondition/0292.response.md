Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an empty list.
- `i` is not defined.
- `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined.
- `max_heap` is empty.
- `tp1` is equal to `m`.
- `tp2` is equal to `-1`.
- `ans` is the sum of all the differences calculated during the loop iterations.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of all the differences calculated during the loop iterations. Since the exact differences and the loop iterations are not detailed, we can only refer to the variable `ans` as it is described.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all the differences calculated during the loop iterations)**
