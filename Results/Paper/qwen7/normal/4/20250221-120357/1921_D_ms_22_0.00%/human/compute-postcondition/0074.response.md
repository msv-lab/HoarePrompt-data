Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `tp1` is 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. Since `tp1` was initially undefined (or its value is not specified in the initial state), after this operation, `tp1` becomes 1. The other variables (`ans` and `max_heap`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
