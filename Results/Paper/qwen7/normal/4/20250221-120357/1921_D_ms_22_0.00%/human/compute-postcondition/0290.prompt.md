Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined since the loop has completed, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined as they are local variables within the loop, `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `i` is an element from the original list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which element of `b` (`b[0]` or `b[m - 1]`) was closer to `i`, and `-diff` is the negative of the absolute difference between `i` and either `b[0]` or `b[m - 1]`. The value of `tp1` remains `0`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` remains `0`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` where `item[1]` is the element popped from `max_heap` and `item[2]` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which element of `b` was closer to the popped element, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans + diff2` or `ans - item[0]`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]` or `ans - item[0]` (which means `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]` in both cases), and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, where `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. Otherwise, if `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on the condition `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`. If `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. If `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
