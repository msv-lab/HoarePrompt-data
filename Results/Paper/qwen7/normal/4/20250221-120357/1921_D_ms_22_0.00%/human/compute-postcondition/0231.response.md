Postcondition: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. After executing the if-else block, either a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or a new max heap contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.**
