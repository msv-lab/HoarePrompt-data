Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `a`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. After executing the if-else block, either a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is pushed into `max_heap` if `diff1 > diff2`, or a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is added to `max_heap` if `diff1 <= diff2`.
