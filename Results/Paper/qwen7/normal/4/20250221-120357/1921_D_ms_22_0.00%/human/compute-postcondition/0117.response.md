Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`; `max_heap` contains one element (`-diff2, i, m - 1`).**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the max heap using `heapq.heappush`. Since `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, the value of `diff2` is used to create the first element of the tuple, which is negated to ensure the max heap property. The other elements of the tuple are `i` and `m - 1`, which remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `diff1` and `diff2` are preserved.
