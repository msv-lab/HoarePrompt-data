Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is empty, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`) remain unchanged.
