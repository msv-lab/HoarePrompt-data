Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0.**

The code initializes `tp1` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged.
