Output State: **`i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the second last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates `diff2` to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (which is `b[m-1]`). Since `m` was not defined in the initial state, we assume `m` refers to the length of list `b`, making `b[m-1]` the last element of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
