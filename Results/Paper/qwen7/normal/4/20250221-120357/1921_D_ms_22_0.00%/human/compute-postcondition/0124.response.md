Output State: **`i` is `i_next`, `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto a heap named `max_heap`. The values of `i`, `b[0]`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `max_heap` now contains the specified tuple.
