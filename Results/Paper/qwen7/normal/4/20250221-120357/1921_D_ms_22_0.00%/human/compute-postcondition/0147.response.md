Output State: **`ans` is increased by `diff2`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += diff2` increases the value of `ans` by the value of `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
