Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will be empty, meaning it has processed all elements. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum differences encountered during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, if the popped item's index (`item[2]`) is outside the range defined by `tp1` and `tp2`, the loop calculates the maximum difference between `item[1]` (an element from list `a`) and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`, and increments `tp1` or decrements `tp2` accordingly. If the index is within the range, `ans` is directly increased by the negative value of `item[0]`, which represents the maximum difference found so far. The process continues until `max_heap` is empty, ensuring that `ans` contains the total sum of the maximum differences for all elements in `a`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the total sum of the largest absolute differences between elements in list `a` and the nearest elements in list `b` (either `b[0]` or `b[m-1]`), considering the constraints on the indices `tp1` and `tp2`.
