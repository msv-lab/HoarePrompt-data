Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` and its second last element is equal to `tp1`; `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`; `ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
