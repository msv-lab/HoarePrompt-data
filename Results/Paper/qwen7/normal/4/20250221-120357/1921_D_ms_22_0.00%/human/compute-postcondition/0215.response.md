Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`. Additionally, `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.
