Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The variable `item` is assumed to be a tuple or list where `item[0]` represents the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`. The operation `-item[0]` negates the value of `item[0]` before adding it to `ans`. The state of `max_heap` remains unchanged, and it does not contain the item that was popped.
