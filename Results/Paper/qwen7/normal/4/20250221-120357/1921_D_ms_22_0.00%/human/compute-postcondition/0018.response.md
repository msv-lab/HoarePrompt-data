Output State: **`i` is the first element of `a`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; `max_heap` contains one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1)**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. Since `diff1 > diff2` is false, `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, but the initial values of these variables remain unchanged. The `max_heap` now contains one element, which is the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
