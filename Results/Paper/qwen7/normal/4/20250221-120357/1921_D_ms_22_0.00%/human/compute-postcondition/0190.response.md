Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by -item[0], if `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
