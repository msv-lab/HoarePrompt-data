Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` where `item[1]` is the element popped from `max_heap` and `item[2]` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which element of `b` was closer to the popped element, `tp1` remains `0`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` remains `0`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops the highest priority element from `max_heap`, which is a heap containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`. Here, `item` will be a tuple from `max_heap`. The first element of this tuple is `(-diff)`, the second element is `i`, and the third element is `index`. After popping, `max_heap` will no longer contain this tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.
