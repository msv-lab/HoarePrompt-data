Output State: **`i` is `i_next`, `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`**.

This means that `diff2` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between `i` (which is `i_next`) and the last element of the list `b` (i.e., `b[m - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
