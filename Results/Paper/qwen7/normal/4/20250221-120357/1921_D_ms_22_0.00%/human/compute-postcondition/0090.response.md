Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by the negative value of the first element of the popped item `item`.**

This means that the `ans` variable has been updated by adding the negative value of the first element of the `item` tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. The `max_heap` itself remains unchanged except for the fact that the highest value item (represented by `item`) has been removed.
