The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `max_heap`. For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must not be empty.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
