Postcondition: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
