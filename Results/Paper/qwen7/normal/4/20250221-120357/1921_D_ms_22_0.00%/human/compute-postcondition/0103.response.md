Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is empty, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `t` is equal to `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are stored in the list `a`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
