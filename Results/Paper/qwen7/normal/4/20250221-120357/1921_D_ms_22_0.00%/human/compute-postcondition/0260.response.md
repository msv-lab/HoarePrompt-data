Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans + diff2` or `ans - item[0]`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The line `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops the smallest element (by default, the first element when using a max heap due to the negative sign) from `max_heap` and assigns it to `item`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
