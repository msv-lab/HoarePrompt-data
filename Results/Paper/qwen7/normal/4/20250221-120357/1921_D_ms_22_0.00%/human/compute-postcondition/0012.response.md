Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a:`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from the list `a`.
   - Since the loop starts with the first value of `a`, `i` will be set to the first element of `a` on the first iteration.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans` is initially 0, but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space, and the loop will start with the first element of `a`.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space and sorted in ascending order, but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `max_heap` is an empty list, but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `tp1` is 0, but this is not directly related to the loop head.
   - `tp2` is `m - 1`, but this is not directly related to the loop head.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`, which will be set to the first element of `a` on the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`i` is the first element of `a`**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is the first element of `a`**
