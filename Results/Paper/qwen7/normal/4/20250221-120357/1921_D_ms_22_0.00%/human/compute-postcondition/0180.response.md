Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, if `diff1` is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff1` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. This value is stored in `diff1`, but no other changes occur to the variables. The conditions for updating `tp1` and `tp2` or changing `ans` are not met since those depend on subsequent code execution. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `diff1` along with the unchanged variables from the initial state.
