Output State: **`tp1` is 0, `max_heap` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

In this step, the code initializes `tp1` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
