Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater. If `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1. Alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.
