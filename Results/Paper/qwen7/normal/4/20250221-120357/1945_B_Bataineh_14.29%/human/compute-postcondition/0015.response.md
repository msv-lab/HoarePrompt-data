The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 2**
