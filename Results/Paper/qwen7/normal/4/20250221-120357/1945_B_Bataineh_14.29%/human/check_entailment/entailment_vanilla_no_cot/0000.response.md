Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic used in the `if` statement is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if m < a or m < b:` does not accurately reflect the conditions under which the maximum number of fireworks would be visible simultaneously.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, because that's the interval at which both installations will launch fireworks at the same time. The formula to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be launched within the visibility period `m`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation within the visibility period
        fireworks_a = (m + a - 1) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b - 1) // b
        # Subtract 1 because the fireworks launched at the same time (LCM) are counted twice
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function calculates the LCM of `a` and `b`, then determines the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`. It ensures that fireworks launched at the same time (LCM) are not double-counted.
