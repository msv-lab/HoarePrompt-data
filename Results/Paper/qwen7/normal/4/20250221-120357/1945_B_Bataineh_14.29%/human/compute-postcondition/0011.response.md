Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers equal to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous state. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is now 1, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers entered by the user.
