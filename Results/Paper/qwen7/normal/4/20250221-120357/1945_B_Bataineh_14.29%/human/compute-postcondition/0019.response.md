Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether the condition `m < a or m < b` is true or false, as both the if and else parts maintain the same preconditions and do not alter these variables.
