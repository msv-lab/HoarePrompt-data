Output State: **`l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is incremented by 3, `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 1])`**

Explanation: Initially, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]`, `index` is incremented by 1, and `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. After executing `index += 2`, the value of `index` is incremented by 2. Therefore, `l` remains unchanged (still assigned the value of `data[index - 2]`), `index` is now incremented by 3 (from its original increment by 1 and the additional increment by 2), and `r` remains unchanged (still assigned the value of `int(data[index - 1])`).
