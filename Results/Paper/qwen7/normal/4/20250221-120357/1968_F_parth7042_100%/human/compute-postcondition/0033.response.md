Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]**.

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given that `index` was initially incremented by 1, the new value of `index` is incremented by 3 in total. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
