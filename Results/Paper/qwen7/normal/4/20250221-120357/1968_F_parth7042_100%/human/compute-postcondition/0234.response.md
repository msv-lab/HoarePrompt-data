Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code appends `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since the initial state of `results` was either `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']` or `['YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`, appending `'NO'` to it results in `['YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']` (depending on the initial length). The other variables (`q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `append` operation.
