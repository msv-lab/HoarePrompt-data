Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` now contains 'NO', 'YES'**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained only 'NO'. After appending 'YES', `results` now contains both 'NO' and 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
