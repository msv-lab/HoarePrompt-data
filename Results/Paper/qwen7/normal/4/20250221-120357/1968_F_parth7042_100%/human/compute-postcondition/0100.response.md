Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `i` is increased by 1.
   - `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.
   - `mp[pf[3]]` contains `[3]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` is currently 3, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly mentioned as being modified, so it remains unchanged from its initial value.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. It will be incremented by 1.
   - The other variables (`pf[3]` and `mp[pf[3]]`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
