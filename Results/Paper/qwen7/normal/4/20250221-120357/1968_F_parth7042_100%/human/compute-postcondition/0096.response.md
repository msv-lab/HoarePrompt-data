Output State: **`i` is 3, `a[3]` is an integer value from `data[index]`**.

The code assigns an integer value from `data[index]` to `a[i]`. Since `i` is initially 3, `a[3]` now holds the integer value from `data[index]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` must be the same as before is still valid.
