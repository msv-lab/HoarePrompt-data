Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` calculates the position where `r - 1` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain the sorted order. This does not change the values of `results`, `q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. It only updates `it2` to reflect the position calculation.
