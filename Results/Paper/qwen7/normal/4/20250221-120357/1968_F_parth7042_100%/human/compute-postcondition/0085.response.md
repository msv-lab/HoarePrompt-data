Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `q` is `q - (n + 1) - int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `l` and `r` are the integers from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, and `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
