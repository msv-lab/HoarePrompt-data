Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in the range of `v2` up to the end, or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted.**

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained 'YES', 'NO', 'YES'. After appending 'NO', `results` now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO'. The other variables (`q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
