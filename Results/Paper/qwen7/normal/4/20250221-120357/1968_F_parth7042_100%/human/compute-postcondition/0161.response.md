Output State: **`index` is now `initial_index + 2 * (q + 1) + 2`, `q` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`, `l` and `r` have their final values after `q` updates, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` have their final values after `q` iterations, and `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, the new value of `index` is calculated as `initial_index + 2 * (q + 1) + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
