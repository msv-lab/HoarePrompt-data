Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `v1` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `it2` is now `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that after the execution of the if-else block, the variables retain their initial conditions as described in the precondition, with `results` containing either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the evaluation of the conditions within the if-else block.
