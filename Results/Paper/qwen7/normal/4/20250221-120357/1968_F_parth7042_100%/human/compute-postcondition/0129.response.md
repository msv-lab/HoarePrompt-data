Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, `results` now contains 'YES'; otherwise, `results` now contains 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increases the value of `index` by 2. Since `index` was previously increased by 2, the total increase in `index` is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
