Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is not explicitly given in the state before the loop, but it is implied by the range `range(1, n + 1)`. The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the State of `n`**: The value of `n` is derived from `data[index]`, which means it is an integer obtained from the data at the position specified by `index`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range `range(1, n + 1)` implies that `i` will increment from 1 up to `n + 1 - 1 = n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state after adjustment would be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
