Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns `mp[pf[l - 1]]` to `v2`. Since `pf[l - 1]` is already known from the initial state, `v2` is now set to the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
