Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains 'YES', `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously containing either `'NO'` or `'YES'` based on the condition, it now contains `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
