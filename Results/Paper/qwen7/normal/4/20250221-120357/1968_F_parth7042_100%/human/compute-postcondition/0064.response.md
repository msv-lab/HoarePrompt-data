Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1`, `index` is `index + 8`, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, `results` contains 'YES'; otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.**
