Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 5, `pf[5]` is `pf[4]` ^ `a[5]`, `mp[pf[5]]` is a list containing the value 5**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to `i + 1`, making `i` equal to 5. It also updates `a[i]` to the value of `data[index]`. Since `index` was previously increased by 3, the new value of `index` is the old value plus 3. The value of `pf[5]` is calculated as `pf[4]` XOR `a[5]` (which is the same as `data[index]`). The dictionary `mp` is updated such that `mp[pf[5]]` contains the value 5.
