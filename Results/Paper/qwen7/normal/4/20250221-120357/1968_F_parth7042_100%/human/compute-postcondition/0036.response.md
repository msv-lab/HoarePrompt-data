Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and the value of `x` is 0, `results` now contains 'YES'**.

This means that the list `results` has been appended with the string `'YES'`, while all other variables retain their previous states. The value of `x` remains 0 as per the initial condition.
