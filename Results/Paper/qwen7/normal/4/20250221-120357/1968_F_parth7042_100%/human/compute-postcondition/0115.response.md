Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, the current value of `x` remains 0, and the `results` list now contains 'YES' and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `x` does not equal 0, no changes occur to the variables.
