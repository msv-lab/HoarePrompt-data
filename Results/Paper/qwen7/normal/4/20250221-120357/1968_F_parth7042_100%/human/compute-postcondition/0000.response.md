Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not affected by this operation. The value of `n` and `q` are not known yet because they are part of the subsequent input, and the list `data` now holds the split input as strings.
