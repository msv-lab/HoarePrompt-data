Output State: **`i` is 2; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`; `mp[pf[2]]` is `[2]`**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` updates the dictionary `mp` such that the key `pf[i]` (which is `pf[2]` given the current state) gets the value `i` (which is 2) appended to its list. Initially, `pf[1]` is set to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
