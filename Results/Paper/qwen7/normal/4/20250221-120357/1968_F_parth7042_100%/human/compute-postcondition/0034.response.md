Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r]` XOR `pf[l - 1]`. The other variables retain their initial conditions or the changes specified in the initial state.
