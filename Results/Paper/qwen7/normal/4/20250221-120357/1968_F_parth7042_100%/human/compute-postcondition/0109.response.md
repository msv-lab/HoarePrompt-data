Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2.**

The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The other variables (`q`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
