Postcondition: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in the range of `v2` up to the end, or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `it2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `it2` is updated based on the condition of the else part.**
