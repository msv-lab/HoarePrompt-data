### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through each test case, parsing `n` and `q` for each test case, and subsequently the array `a`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly computed, where `pf[i]` stores the cumulative XOR from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - This is done efficiently with a single loop.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**:
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that XOR value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding the positions of the prefix XOR values.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program computes the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array (`pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`).
   - If this XOR is zero, the subarray is considered interesting, and 'YES' is appended to the results list.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if there exists a valid split by using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices in the mapped lists. If such indices exist, the subarray is marked as interesting ('YES'); otherwise, it is not ('NO').

5. **Output**:
   - The results list is printed after processing all test cases and queries.

Given the detailed steps and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly processes each test case and query according to the problem's requirements and produces the expected output.
