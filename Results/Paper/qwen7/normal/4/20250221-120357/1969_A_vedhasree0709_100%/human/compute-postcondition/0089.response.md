Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `i` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and the value of `q` is updated to the value of `l[p - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of the variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged except for the fact that we now know we have exited the loop or conditional block.
