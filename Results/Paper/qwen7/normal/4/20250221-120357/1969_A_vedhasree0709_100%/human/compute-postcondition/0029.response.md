Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 4 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.**

The code `j = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. Since `j` was already 1 in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
