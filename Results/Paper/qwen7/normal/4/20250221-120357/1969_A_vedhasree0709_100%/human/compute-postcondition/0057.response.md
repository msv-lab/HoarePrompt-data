Output State: **`i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[1]`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2 and `p` is set to `l[2]`. The code snippet `q = l[p - 1]` means that `q` is assigned the value of the element at index `p - 1` in list `l`. Since `p` is `l[2]`, `p - 1` is `l[2] - 1`, which is `l[1]`. Therefore, `q` is assigned the value of `l[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
