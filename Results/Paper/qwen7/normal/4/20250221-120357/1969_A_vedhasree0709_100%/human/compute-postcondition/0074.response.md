Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n` (since the loop increments `i` until it is greater than `n-1`). The variable `j` is set to 1 inside the loop if the condition `q == i + 1` is met at any point, which it is based on the given output states after the first three iterations. Therefore, `j` remains 1. The values of `p` and `q` will be the last values computed within the loop, which are `l[n-1]` and `l[l[n-1] - 1]`, respectively.
