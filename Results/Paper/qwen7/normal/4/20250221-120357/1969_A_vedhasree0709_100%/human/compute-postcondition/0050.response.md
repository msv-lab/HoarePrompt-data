Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index 0 of the list `l`, so `p = l[0]`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and it is given that `q` is equal to `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `q` is `0 + 1 = 1`.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This statement will print the integer 2 directly.

Output: **2**
