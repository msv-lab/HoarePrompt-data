Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
