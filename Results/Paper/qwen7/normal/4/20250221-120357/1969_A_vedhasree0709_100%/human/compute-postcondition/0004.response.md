Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. Since `i`, `t`, `n`, and `l` are not affected by this assignment, their states remain unchanged.
