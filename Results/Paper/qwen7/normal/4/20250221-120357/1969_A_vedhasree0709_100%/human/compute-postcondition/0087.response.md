Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index `i` of the list `l`, so `p = l[i] = l[0]`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, so `q = l[p - 1] = l[l[0] - 1]`.
- The value of `q` is updated to the value of `l[p - 1]`, which means `q = l[l[0] - 1]`.
- Additionally, `q` is equal to `i + 1`, so `q = i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2.

Output: **2**
