Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `p` is `l[2]`
   - `q` is `l[1]`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 3. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` remains 3 (no change needed as it already satisfies the condition)
   - `p` and `q` remain unchanged (no change needed as they are not part of the loop condition)

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 3.

**State: **`i` is 3, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[1]`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
