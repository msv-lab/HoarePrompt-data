Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 0 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
