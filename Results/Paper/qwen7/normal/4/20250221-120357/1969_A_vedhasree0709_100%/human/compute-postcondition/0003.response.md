Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
