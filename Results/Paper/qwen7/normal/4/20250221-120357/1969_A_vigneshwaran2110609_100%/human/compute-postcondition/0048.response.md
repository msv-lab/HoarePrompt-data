Output State: **`x` is a new input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a new input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `x`, `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
