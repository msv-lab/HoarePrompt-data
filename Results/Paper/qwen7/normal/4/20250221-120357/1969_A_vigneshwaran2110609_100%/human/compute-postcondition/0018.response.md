Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though the value of `i` after incrementing is not relevant to the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `flag` is `True`.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This statement will print the integer `2` directly without referencing any of the other variables or objects.

Output: **2**
