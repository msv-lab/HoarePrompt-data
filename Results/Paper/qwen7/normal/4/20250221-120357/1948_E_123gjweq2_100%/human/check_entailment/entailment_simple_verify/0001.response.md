### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the claims:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques correctly using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - However, the function initializes `arr` and `cliquess` as lists of zeros and then attempts to fill them using the `make_array` function.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function is intended to fill `arr` and `cliquess` with values and corresponding clique numbers.
   - The logic inside `make_array` is flawed:
     - The indices used in the loops do not correctly distribute the elements into different cliques.
     - The values being assigned are not consistent with the problem constraints.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in `func_1` calls `make_array` incorrectly. It should pass the correct indices and values, but the current implementation does not do this properly.
   - The assignment of values to `arr` and `cliquess` is not done in a way that ensures all conditions are met (distinct integers, valid cliques).

### Detailed Issues

- **Incorrect Assignment in `make_array`**:
  - The function `make_array` is supposed to fill `arr` and `cliquess` based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.
  - However, the indices and values being assigned are not correctly calculated to form valid cliques.

- **Incorrect Use of `make_array` in `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` calls `make_array` with incorrect arguments and does not handle the distribution of values and cliques correctly.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Given the example test cases:
- For `n=2` and `k=3`, the expected output is:
  ```
  2 1
  1
  1 1
  ```

- For `n=5` and `k=4`, the expected output is:
  ```
  3 1 5 2 4
  2
  1 1 2 1 2
  ```

- For `n=8` and `k=16`, the expected output is:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  1
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to assign values to vertices and form valid cliques. The functions `func_1` and `make_array` need significant corrections to ensure the output meets the problem requirements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Final: **False**
