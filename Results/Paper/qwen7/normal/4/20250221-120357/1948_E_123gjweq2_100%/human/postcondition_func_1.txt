The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It returns an array `arr` where elements are filled based on the given `left` and `right` indices. Specifically, it fills the array with values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order from the `left + mid - 1` index to the `left` index. It also fills another array `cliquess` with the value `clique` from the `left` index to the `left + mid - 1` index. The remaining elements in both arrays are filled with values from `big_element - (mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1` in ascending order from the `left + mid` index to the `left + not_mid - 1` index.
