Output State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `small_element + mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + mid - 2`, ..., `arr[left]` is `small_element + mid - 1`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `mid`. The array `arr` will have been filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`, starting from index `left + mid - 1` and moving backwards to `left`. The `cliquess` array will have the value `clique` stored from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously unchanged states.
