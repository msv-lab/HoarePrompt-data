You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` with values based on the specified range and clique index.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is at least 1, `i` is `cliques`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, `arr` is a list of `n` ones, `cliquess` is a list of `n` ones.
    #
    #**Explanation:** After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `cliques`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, and it runs from `0` to `cliques-1`, the final value of `i` will be `cliques`. The loop sets elements in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists based on the value of `i * k` and `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`. Given that the loop runs `cliques` times, every index from `0` to `n-1` in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists will be set to `1`, making both lists a list of `n` ones.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is at least 1)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (where there are n ones in the list)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `small_element + mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + mid - 2`, ..., `arr[left]` is `small_element + mid - 1`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `mid`. The array `arr` will have been filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`, starting from index `left + mid - 1` and moving backwards to `left`. The `cliquess` array will have the value `clique` stored from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously unchanged states.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given conditions. Specifically, the `make_array` function is not correctly implemented to assign values to the vertices and create the desired partitioning.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` to store the values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The main logic is in the `make_array` function, which is supposed to assign values to the vertices and determine the clique assignments.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It attempts to split the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assign values to these parts.
   - However, the logic for splitting the range and assigning values is flawed. For example, if `k` is large compared to `n`, the assignment logic may not correctly form the required cliques.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
- `n = 5`, `k = 4`

### Expected Output:
A valid output should partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assign values to vertices such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all edges within the same clique.

### Actual Output:
Running the provided code with `n = 5` and `k = 4` results in:
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

### Analysis:
- The values assigned to vertices are `3, 1, 5, 2, 4`.
- The graph is partitioned into 2 cliques: `{1, 3}` and `{2, 4, 5}`.
- However, this partitioning does not satisfy the condition for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. For instance, vertices `2` and `4` have `|2 - 4| + |2 - 4| = 4`, which is equal to `k`, but they are in different cliques.

This example shows that the program does not correctly form the minimum number of cliques and does not ensure that all vertices within the same clique satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
