Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1; `mid` is ((right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1) // 2; `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - mid.**

Explanation: The variable `not_mid` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` is calculated as `((right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `not_mid` is the total number of elements between `left` and `right` inclusive, minus the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
