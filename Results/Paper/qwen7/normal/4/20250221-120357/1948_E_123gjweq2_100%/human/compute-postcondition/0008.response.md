Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `mid` is a positive integer
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `mid`. Given that `i` is currently 0 (at the end of the previous iteration), it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `mid` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `mid` remains a positive integer.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` becomes `cliquess[left + 1]`.
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` becomes `arr[left + mid - 1 - 1] = arr[left + mid - 2]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1***
