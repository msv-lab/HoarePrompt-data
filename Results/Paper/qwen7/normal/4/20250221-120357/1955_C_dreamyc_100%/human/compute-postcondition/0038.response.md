Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns either the value of n or increments a counter ans by 1 for each iteration where either s_a is less than or equal to a or s_b is less than or equal to b, and finally returns ans after running the loop n times.**
