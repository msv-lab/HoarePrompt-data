You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.
    #State: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of nums is greater than k.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of the last half of the `nums` list (i.e., from `nums[n//2]` to `nums[n-1]`), `i` is `n-1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first half of the `nums` list (i.e., from `nums[0]` to `nums[n//2-1]`).
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first half of the `nums` list, and `s_b` accumulates the sum of the second half of the `nums` list. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where either `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. Since the loop runs `n` times, `ans` will be `n`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is incremented by 1 for each iteration where either `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, and since the loop runs `n` times, `ans` will be `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns either the value of n or increments a counter ans by 1 for each iteration where either s_a is less than or equal to a or s_b is less than or equal to b, and finally returns ans after running the loop n times.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5.

Case_2: The program returns `ans`, which is incremented by 1 for each iteration where either `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, and since the loop runs `n` times, `ans` will be `n`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
