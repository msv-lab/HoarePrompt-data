Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of all elements from `nums[n-1]` to `nums[0]` (i.e., `s_b = sum(nums)`), `i` is `n-1`, `s_a` is the sum of all elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[n-2]` (i.e., `s_a = sum(nums[:n-1])`).

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, meaning it has iterated through all elements of the `nums` list. During each iteration, `s_a` accumulates the sum of elements from the start of the list up to the current index, and `s_b` accumulates the sum of elements from the end of the list backwards to the current index. The `ans` variable is incremented every time either `s_a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to their respective thresholds (`a` and `b`). Since the loop iterates `n` times, `ans` will be `n` if both `s_a` and `s_b` meet their conditions at some point during the loop. In the final state, `s_a` will be the sum of all but the last element of `nums`, and `s_b` will be the sum of all elements of `nums`.
