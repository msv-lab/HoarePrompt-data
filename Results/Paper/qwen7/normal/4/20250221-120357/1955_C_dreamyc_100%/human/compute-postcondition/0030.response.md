Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 3, `s_b` is `nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 5]`, `i` is 4, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3]`**

Explanation: The line `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` adds the value of `nums[n - i - 1]` to `s_b`. Given that `i` is 4, `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 4 - 1` which is `n - 5`. So, `s_b` is updated to include the value of `nums[n - 5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
