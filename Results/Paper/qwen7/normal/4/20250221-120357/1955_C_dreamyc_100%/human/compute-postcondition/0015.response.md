Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 1, `s_b` is `nums[n - i - 1]`, `i` is 0, `s_a` is `nums[0]`. If the first element of `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is set to 1. Given that the condition `(s_b <= b)` is true, `ans` remains 1.
