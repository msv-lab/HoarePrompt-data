State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_b` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_b`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which should be set to 0.
