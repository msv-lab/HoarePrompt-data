The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)), `k` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\)), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)). If the sum of `nums` is less than or equal to `k`, it returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates two values `a` and `b` based on `k`, then iterates through `nums` to count how many times the sum of the first half or the second half of `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, respectively. Finally, it returns the total count.
