Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the array of integers `A`. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values when pairs are formed.
3. **Summation**: It then sums every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This effectively pairs the smallest available elements and adds their minimum value to the score.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the computed score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the approach taken, this program will correctly compute the maximum final score for any valid input as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
