### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that the score increases by \(\min(x, y)\) for each pair, and the process is repeated \(n\) times until no integers remain on the board.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available integers in each pair. Sorting the array ensures that the smallest integers are paired together first, which aligns with the optimal strategy.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums every other element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.), which corresponds to pairing the smallest elements together.
   - This sum is printed as the result.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired first, maximizing the score.
   - Summing every other element starting from the first element correctly implements the optimal strategy of always choosing the smallest available integers.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the optimal solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
