Output State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 4997, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `t` becomes 0), `t` will be 0, meaning the loop condition `t` is no longer satisfied, and thus the loop terminates. At this point, `n` and `A` will retain their last values from the final iteration of the loop.
