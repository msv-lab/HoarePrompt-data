Output State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 4997, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `t` becomes 0), `t` will be 0, meaning the loop condition `while t:` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. At this point, `n` and `A` will still be as they were during the last iteration of the loop, since the loop body does not modify these variables outside of the loop's scope.
