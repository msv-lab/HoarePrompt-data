Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It sorts the list of numbers and then sums up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which corresponds to selecting the minimum of pairs of adjacent elements in the sorted list. This ensures that the score is maximized because the smallest elements are paired together, leading to the highest possible sum of minimum values.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program works as expected for all potential cases. Sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices guarantees the maximum score achievable by always pairing the smallest available elements. Therefore, the program is correct.
