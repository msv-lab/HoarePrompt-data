Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `A` remain unchanged.
