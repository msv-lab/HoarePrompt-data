Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available pair of numbers. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array of numbers. Sorting ensures that when we pick pairs, we always pick the smallest available numbers first, which maximizes the sum of the minimums of each pair.

2. **Summing Every Second Element**: After sorting, the program sums every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This effectively pairs up the smallest elements and calculates the score by adding their minimum values.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.

4. **Correct Output**: The output matches the expected result, as demonstrated in the provided example.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to achieve the maximum score.

Correctness: **True**
