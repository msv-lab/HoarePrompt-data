Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the requirement for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero.
3. **Check the given state**: The state right before the loop is that `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
4. **Adjust the state if necessary**: Since \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) already ensures that `t` is non-zero, no adjustment is needed.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000**
