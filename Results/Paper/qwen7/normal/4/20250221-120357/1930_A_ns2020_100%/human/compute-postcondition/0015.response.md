Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `A`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `n` remains an input integer. The list `A` is updated to contain the integers obtained from the input.
