### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
   - The maximum possible sum can always be obtained in no more than \(2n\) operations.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls the function `func_1()` for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads the size of the matrix \(n\).
   - It then prints a formula for the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6\) and \(2n\) respectively.
   - It then performs \(2n\) operations, but these operations do not actually change the values in the matrix. Instead, it prints permutations of the numbers from 1 to \(n\) for both row and column operations.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
     ```
     7 4
     1 1 2 1
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 2 1
     2 2 2 1
     ```
   - This suggests that the maximum sum is 7 and the operations are performed as specified, but the actual matrix values remain unchanged. The printed permutations do not reflect any meaningful changes to the matrix values.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum, we need to strategically set the values in the matrix. For example, for \(n = 2\), setting the matrix as:
     ```
     1 2
     2 1
     ```
     gives a sum of \(1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6\), which is the correct maximum sum.
   - The program, however, does not perform any such strategic setting of values. It merely prints permutations, which do not affect the matrix values.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and is thus incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
