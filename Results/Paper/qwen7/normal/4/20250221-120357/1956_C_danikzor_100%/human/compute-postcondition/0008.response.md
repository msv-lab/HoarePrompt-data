Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 1

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition that `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
