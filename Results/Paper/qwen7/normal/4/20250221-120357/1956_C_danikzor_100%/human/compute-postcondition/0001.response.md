Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\), and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

When the `print` statement executes, it will print two values:

1. The result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
2. The value of `2 * n`.

Since `n` is determined by user input, let's denote the user input as `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq 500\). Therefore:

- The first part of the print statement evaluates to \(k * (k + 1) * (4 * k - 1) // 6\).
- The second part of the print statement evaluates to \(2 * k\).

So, the output will be:

Output: **k * (k + 1) * (4 * k - 1) // 6, 2 * k**
