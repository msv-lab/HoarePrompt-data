Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, with `i` taking on each integer value from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n`, and `n` can be any integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

This means that the last line printed will be `2 n * (range(n, 0, -1))`, showing the sequence from `n` down to 1.
