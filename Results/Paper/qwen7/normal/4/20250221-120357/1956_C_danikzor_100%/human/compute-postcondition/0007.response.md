Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be at least 1, but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The first argument `2` is a constant.
2. The second argument `i` is also a constant and is explicitly given as 2.
3. The third argument uses `range(n, 0, -1)`. Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 1. If `n` were greater than 1, the range would include more numbers, but since no specific value is given, we assume the minimum.

When `n` is 1, `range(n, 0, -1)` generates an empty sequence because there are no numbers between 1 and 0 (inclusive).

Therefore, the `*range(n, 0, -1)` part will expand to an empty sequence, meaning nothing will be printed after the number 2 and 2.

Output: **2 2**
