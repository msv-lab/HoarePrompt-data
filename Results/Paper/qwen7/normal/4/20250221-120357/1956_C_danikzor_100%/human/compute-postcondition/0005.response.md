Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n + 1` must be true.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since 1 < n + 1).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must still be at least 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
