Postcondition: `work` is True, `i` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string with length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string, and the current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.
