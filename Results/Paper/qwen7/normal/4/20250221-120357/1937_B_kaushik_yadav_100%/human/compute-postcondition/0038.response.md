Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is increased by the value of `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `b[i]`, where `i` is currently 3. Since `i` is not reassigned within the given code snippet, its value remains 3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `b[3]` to its current value.
