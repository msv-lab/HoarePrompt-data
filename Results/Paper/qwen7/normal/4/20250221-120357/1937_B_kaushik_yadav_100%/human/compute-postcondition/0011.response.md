Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `work` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so it appends `a[0]` to `ans`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code snippet, it's implied by the context), making `i` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
