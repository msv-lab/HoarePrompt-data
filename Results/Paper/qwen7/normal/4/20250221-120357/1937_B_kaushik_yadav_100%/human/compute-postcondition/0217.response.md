Postcondition: **`i` is either 3 or 2, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `a[1]` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[1]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.**
