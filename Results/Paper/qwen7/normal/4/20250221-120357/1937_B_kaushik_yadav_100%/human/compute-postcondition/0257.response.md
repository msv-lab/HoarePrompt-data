Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, `a` has more than 1 element. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` becomes either 2 or 3. If `a[j + 1] != b[j]`, and neither `a[j + 1] == '0'` nor `b[j] == '1'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, no action is taken.
