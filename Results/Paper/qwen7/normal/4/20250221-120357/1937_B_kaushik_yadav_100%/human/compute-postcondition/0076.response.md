Postcondition: `i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 1 (or 2 if `a[1] == b[0]`), and `j` is 1. If the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is true, `j` will be incremented. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement will be exited.
