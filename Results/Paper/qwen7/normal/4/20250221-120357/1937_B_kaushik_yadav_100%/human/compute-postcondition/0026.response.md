Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and `work` is set to `False`. If `i` is 2, `ans` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, and `work` is set to `False` if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains `True`. If `i` is 1, `ans` is the string `b[0]`, and `work` is set to `False`.
