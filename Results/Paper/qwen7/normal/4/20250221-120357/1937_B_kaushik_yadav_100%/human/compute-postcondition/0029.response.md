Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the value added to `ans` is `a[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the index used in the array access is `i` itself, which is 3. Therefore, `ans` is updated to its current value plus `a[3]`.
