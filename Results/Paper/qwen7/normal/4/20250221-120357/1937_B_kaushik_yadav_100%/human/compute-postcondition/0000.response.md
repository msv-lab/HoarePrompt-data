Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1, and the input function is now set to read from stdin.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` changes the way input is read from standard input (stdin) but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the binary strings. Therefore, these values remain as described in the initial state.
