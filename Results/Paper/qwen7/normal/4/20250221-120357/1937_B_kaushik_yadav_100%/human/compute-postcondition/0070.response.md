Postcondition: **`i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 1, `j` is 0, and either `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', in which case `counter` remains 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
