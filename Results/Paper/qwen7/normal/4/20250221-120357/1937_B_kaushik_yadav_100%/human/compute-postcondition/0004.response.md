Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`**.

The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `a`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
