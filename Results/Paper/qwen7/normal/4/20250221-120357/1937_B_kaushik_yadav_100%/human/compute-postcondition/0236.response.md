Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(len(a) - 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `counter` is initially 1.
   - `a` is a list (since `len(a)` is being used).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `len(a) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `len(a)` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty list (i.e., `len(a) >= 1`).
   - The variable `j` will start from 0 and go up to `len(a) - 2` during the loop iterations. Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` should be 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must be a non-empty list.
- `j` must be 0.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts is:

**State: `counter` is 1, `a` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0**
