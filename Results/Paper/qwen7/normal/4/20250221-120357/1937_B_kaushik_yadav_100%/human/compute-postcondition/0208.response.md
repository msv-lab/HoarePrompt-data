Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `a[1]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace**.

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `ans` was the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]` (which is `a[1]`). After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `ans` now includes the first character of `a` followed by `a[1]` and then `a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
