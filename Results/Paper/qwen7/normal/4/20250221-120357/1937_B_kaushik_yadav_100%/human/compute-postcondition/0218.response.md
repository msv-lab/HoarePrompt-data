To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and ensure that the condition `i < len(a)` is satisfied.

Given the loop condition `i < len(a)`, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `a`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is either 3 or 2
- `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1
- `work` is either True or False
- `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `a[1]` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[1]`
- `counter` is either 1 or 2
- `t` is 0
- `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace
- `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented such that `i < len(a)` holds true. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (either 3 or 2).

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:

- If `i` is currently 3, incrementing `i` to 4 would make `i < len(a)` true.
- If `i` is currently 2, incrementing `i` to 3 would make `i < len(a)` true.

Since the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition is `i`, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`i` must be incremented to 3 if it is currently 2, or to 4 if it is currently 3**
