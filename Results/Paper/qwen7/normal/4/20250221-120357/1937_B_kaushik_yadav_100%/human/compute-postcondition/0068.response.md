Output State: **`i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 1, `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no further operations are performed after the `break`, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions that were valid before the `break` statement was executed.
