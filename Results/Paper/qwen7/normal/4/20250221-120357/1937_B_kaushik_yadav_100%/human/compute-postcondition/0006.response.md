Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
