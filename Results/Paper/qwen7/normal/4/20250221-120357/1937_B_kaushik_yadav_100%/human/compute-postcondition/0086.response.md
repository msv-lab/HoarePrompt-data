Postcondition: `i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is 3. Otherwise, `counter` is either 1 (if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`) or remains 2.
