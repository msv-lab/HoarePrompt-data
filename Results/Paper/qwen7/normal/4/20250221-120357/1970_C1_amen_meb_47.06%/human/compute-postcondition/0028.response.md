Functionality: **The function processes pairs of integers [u, v] within the specified constraints (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), storing each valid pair in a list named 'numbers'. Upon completion, it returns the list 'numbers'. Throughout the process, the variable t remains as 1, and the last pair of integers entered are stored in num1 and num2.**
