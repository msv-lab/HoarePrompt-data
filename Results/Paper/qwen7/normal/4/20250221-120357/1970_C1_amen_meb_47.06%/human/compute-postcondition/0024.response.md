Output State: The loop will terminate when the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. After all iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` and `num2` will be the last pair of integers provided by the user before the loop breaks, and `numbers` is a list containing all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` provided by the user.

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial condition, `t` remains 1, `u` and `v` can be any integers within their defined range, `num1` and `num2` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user, and `numbers` will be a list containing all the pairs of integers entered by the user during the loop's execution.
