The `while True` loop does not have any conditions in the loop head to determine whether it should continue executing. Therefore, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

Given that the loop is `while True`, no adjustments to the states are necessary to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The loop will always execute again because it is an infinite loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, and the list `numbers` contains one element which is `[num1, num2]`.**
