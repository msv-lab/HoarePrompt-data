Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes pairs of integers [u, v] within the given constraints (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), stores each pair in a list named 'numbers', and returns the list. The variables t, u, and v remain as 1 throughout the process, and the last pair of integers entered are stored in num1 and num2.**
