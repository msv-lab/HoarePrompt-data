Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function reads pairs of numbers from standard input until a line with less than 2 numbers is encountered.
   - It appends these pairs to a list called `numbers`.
   - However, the problem statement does not mention any input reading from standard input. Instead, it provides the edges of the tree directly in the input format.
   - Therefore, the function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented for the given problem.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main part of the program initializes `Ron_co` and `Hib_co` to count the number of times Ron and Hermione win, respectively.
   - It then iterates over the result of `func_1()`, but since `func_1()` is not correctly implemented, the `result` will be empty or incorrect.
   - The logic inside the loop checks if `num_1` is greater than `num_2` to increment `Ron_co` or `Hib_co` accordingly. However, this logic is irrelevant to the actual game logic described in the problem.
   - Finally, it prints 'Ron' if `Ron_co` is greater than `Hib_co`, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. This is also irrelevant to the game logic.

### Conclusion:

Given that the function `func_1()` is not correctly implemented to read the input as specified in the problem, and the subsequent logic does not match the game rules, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
