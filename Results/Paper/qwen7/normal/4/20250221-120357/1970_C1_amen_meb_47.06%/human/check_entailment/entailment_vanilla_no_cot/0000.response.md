Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The `func_1()` function reads input from standard input, which is not aligned with the problem's input format. The problem specifies that the input is provided through a predefined format, not through user input.

2. **Misinterpretation of Game Logic**: The program seems to be trying to count something (likely the number of moves each player can make), but the logic for determining the winner based on optimal play is not implemented correctly. The game logic should consider the structure of the tree and the optimal strategy for both players, which is not reflected in the current implementation.

3. **No Game Logic Implementation**: There is no code that implements the game logic to determine the winner based on the structure of the tree and the optimal play of both players. The current approach does not account for the specific properties of the tree (having exactly two leaves) or the optimal strategy for the players.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to implement the game logic based on the structure of the tree and the optimal play of both players. Specifically, you should consider the following:

- The tree structure and the fact that it has exactly two leaves.
- The optimal strategy for both players, which involves understanding the parity of the number of moves and the position of the stone.

A correct solution would involve analyzing the tree structure and determining the winner based on the optimal play of both players.
