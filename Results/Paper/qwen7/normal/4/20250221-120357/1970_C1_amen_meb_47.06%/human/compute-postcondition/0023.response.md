Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, and `numbers` is a list containing one sublist `[num1, num2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a sublist `[num1, num2]` to the list `numbers`. Since `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums` and `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, the list `numbers` now contains one sublist `[num1, num2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
