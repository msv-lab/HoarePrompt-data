You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will terminate when the input no longer consists of exactly two elements. After all iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` and `num2` will hold the last pair of integers provided as input, and `numbers` is a list containing all pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` provided as input until the loop terminates.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `n` remains within its initial range, `t` stays as 1, `u` and `v` stay within their initial range, `num1` and `num2` will be the last two numbers entered, and `numbers` will contain every pair of numbers entered during the loop's execution.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list named 'numbers' which contains every pair of integers [num1, num2] provided as input during the loop's execution, with each element in the list being a pair of integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The variables t, u, and v remain as 1, and the last pair of integers entered are stored in num1 and num2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes pairs of integers [u, v] within the given constraints (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), stores each pair in a list named 'numbers', and returns the list. The variables t, u, and v remain as 1 throughout the process, and the last pair of integers entered are stored in num1 and num2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'numbers' which contains every pair of integers [num1, num2] provided as input during the loop's execution, with each element in the list being a pair of integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The variables t, u, and v remain as 1, and the last pair of integers entered are stored in num1 and num2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
