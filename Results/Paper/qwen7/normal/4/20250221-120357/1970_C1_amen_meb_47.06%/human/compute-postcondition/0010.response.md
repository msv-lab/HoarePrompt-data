The `while True` loop does not have any condition based on the variables in the loop body to determine whether it should continue executing. Therefore, there are no specific conditions to check or adjust based on the loop head variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `num1`, `num2`, `nums`). Since the loop will always execute as long as it is running, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

However, since we need to provide a state that reflects the readiness for the next iteration, we can simply repeat the current state as it is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the second element of the list `nums`, `nums` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`**
