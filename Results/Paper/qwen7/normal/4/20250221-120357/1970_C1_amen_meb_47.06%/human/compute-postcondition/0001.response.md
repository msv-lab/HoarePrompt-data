The only variable in the loop head is the boolean condition `True`, which always evaluates to `True`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time since the loop will always proceed regardless of the current state of the variables.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is an empty list.**
