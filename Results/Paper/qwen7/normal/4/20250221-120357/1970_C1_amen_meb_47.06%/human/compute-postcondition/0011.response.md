Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the second element of the list `nums`, `nums` is a list containing the strings split from the input, where each string represents an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The initial values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `num1`, and `num2` remain unchanged, but `nums` now contains the split strings from the input, which are expected to be integers.
