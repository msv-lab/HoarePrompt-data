Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Strategy**: Eve should remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. Bob wins if the final XOR is zero.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Reasoning
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the number of pairs of identical numbers. Since XOR of identical numbers is zero, removing these pairs ensures that the remaining numbers' XOR might be zero.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it means there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s combined, which can contribute to making the final XOR zero.

### Correctness Check
- **Pairs Removal**: Removing pairs of identical numbers (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`) ensures that the XOR of the remaining numbers can be zero, maximizing Bob's wins.
- **Odd Remainder Check**: The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` correctly identifies if there are enough odd numbers to potentially make the final XOR zero.

Given the logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
