Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into four integers and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `i` was initially set to 0 and remains unchanged. The input values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positive integers between 1 and \(10^4\).
