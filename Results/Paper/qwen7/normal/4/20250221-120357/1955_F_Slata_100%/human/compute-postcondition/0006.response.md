Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the expression `for i in range(int(input())):`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is the first input integer
   - `b` is the second input integer
   - `c` is the third input integer
   - `d` is the fourth input integer

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. The value of `int(input())` will determine if the loop continues or not.

5. **Update the state**: Since the loop head only involves the variable `i`, we only need to update `i` to 2. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer**
