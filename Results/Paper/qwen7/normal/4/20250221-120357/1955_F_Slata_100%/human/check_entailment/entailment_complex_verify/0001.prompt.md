You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: i is 3, a is the first input integer, b is the second input integer, c is the third input integer, d is the fourth input integer, the values of a, b, c, and d are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, and the loop has executed 3 times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts. Specifically, it computes the sum of half the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (using integer division), plus an additional 1 if the sum of the remainders when dividing the counts by 2 equals 3. The function executes this process for up to 10,000 test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Strategy**: Eve should remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. Bob wins if the final XOR is zero.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Reasoning
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the number of pairs of identical numbers. Since XOR of identical numbers is zero, removing these pairs ensures that the remaining numbers' XOR might be zero.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it means there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s combined, which can contribute to making the final XOR zero.

### Correctness Check
- **Pairs Removal**: Removing pairs of identical numbers (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`) ensures that the XOR of the remaining numbers can be zero, maximizing Bob's wins.
- **Odd Remainder Check**: The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` correctly identifies if there are enough odd numbers to potentially make the final XOR zero.

Given the logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
