Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes four space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are preserved, but now `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` hold the integer values from the input.
