Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes four space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 1. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are now the integers entered by the user.
