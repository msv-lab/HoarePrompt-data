### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem statement step-by-step to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

#### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

#### Key Observations
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input `t` and for each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
2. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part calculates the number of pairs of identical numbers. Since XOR of identical numbers is zero, removing these pairs ensures that the remaining numbers' XOR might be zero.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it means there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s combined, which can contribute to making the final XOR zero.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Removing Pairs**:
   - Removing pairs of identical numbers reduces the problem size and ensures that the remaining numbers' XOR can be zero.
   - For example, if there are two 1s, their XOR is zero, and they can be removed without affecting the overall XOR result.

2. **Odd Remainder Check**:
   - The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3. This means there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s combined.
   - If this condition is true, it indicates that there is a way to balance the XOR to zero by strategically removing numbers.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: There is one 1, one 2, and one 3. Removing one 1 and one 3 (since they are odd), we are left with one 2, which results in a zero XOR. Hence, Bob wins once.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: There is one 1, one 3, and two 2s. Removing one 1 and one 3, we are left with two 2s, which results in a zero XOR. Hence, Bob wins once.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: There are two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s. Removing two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s, we are left with no numbers, resulting in a zero XOR. Hence, Bob wins three times.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: There are three 1s, three 2s, and two 3s. Removing three 1s, three 2s, and two 3s, we are left with no numbers, resulting in a zero XOR. Hence, Bob wins three times.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: There are nine 2s, nine 3s, and no 1s or 4s. Removing nine 2s and nine 3s, we are left with no numbers, resulting in a zero XOR. Hence, Bob wins twelve times.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins by removing pairs of identical numbers and checking for the possibility of an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s. The logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples.
