Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a sequence defined by four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively. It returns a value based on the given constraints where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
