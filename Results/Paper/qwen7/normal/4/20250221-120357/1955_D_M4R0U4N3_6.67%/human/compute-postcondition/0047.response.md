Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `done` contains `a[r]` and no changes occur to `todo`.**

The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is `m`, the value of `a[r - m]` remains unchanged and is still referred to as `old`. The value of `todo` remains unaffected, so it still does not contain `a[r]`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `done` now contains `a[r]`.
