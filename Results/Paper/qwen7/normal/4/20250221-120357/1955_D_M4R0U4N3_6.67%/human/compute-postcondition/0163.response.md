Output State: **`ans` is 3, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 2, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 3. The values of `r`, `m`, `old`, `a[r - m]`, `todo`, and `done` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them directly.
