Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `r`. The range of the loop is from `m` to `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `r` is within the range `[m, n)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` was equal to `m`.

3. **Determine the next value of `r`**: Since `r` starts at `m` and increments by 1 in each iteration (assuming no other changes), the next value of `r` will be `m + 1`.

4. **Check the postconditions**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `r` will be incremented to `m + 1`.
   - `old` is either already in `done` or has been added to `todo`. This state does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the loop body, which is omitted.

5. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `r` and its relationship with `m` and `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is 2, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is either already in `done` or has been added to `todo`**
