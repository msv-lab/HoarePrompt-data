Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is now `a[r - m]`, `a[r]` is in `todo`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since no conditions are checked or changes made to `done` and `todo`, their states remain unchanged. The other variables also retain their initial conditions.
