Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra` (but `extra` does not contain `old` now), no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; `old` is no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]` because `extra.remove(old)` has been executed.**

This means that the value of `old` has been removed from the `extra` list, and the other variables retain their previous conditions.
