Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `extra` contains `a[r]`; `old` is either already in `done` or has been added to `todo`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. `extra` now includes `a[r]`, but the conditions for `ans`, `r`, `old`, and the status of `a[r]` in `todo` remain the same as before.
