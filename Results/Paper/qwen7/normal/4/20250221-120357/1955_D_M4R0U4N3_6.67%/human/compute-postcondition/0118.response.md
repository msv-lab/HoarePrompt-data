Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[j]` or `a[0]` depending on whether `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]` if `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise it does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`**.

This postcondition covers both cases of the if and else parts. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `done` will contain `a[j]` and `extra` will be as described. If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `done` will contain `a[0]` and `extra` will be as described.
