Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then no changes occur to `done` and `todo`. Otherwise, if `a[r]` is in `extra` and `old` is no longer in `extra`, then either `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, or no changes occur to `done` and `todo`.
