Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing either `a[0]` (if `a[j]` is in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`), `extra` is a set containing either `a[j]` (if `a[j]` is not in `todo`) or no elements (if `a[j]` is in `todo`), `j` is incremented by 1 if it was 0, or reset to 0 if it was 1, `a[j]` is removed from `todo`.**

Explanation: The line `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. If `j` was 0, it is now 1; if `j` was 1, it is now reset to 0.
