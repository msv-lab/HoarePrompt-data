Output State: **`r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r_end + 1 - m]`, `extra` is `extra - {old}` if `old` was in `extra`, `done` is `done - {old}`, `todo` is `todo + {old}` if `old` was in `done`, `old` is now `a[r - m]`**

Explanation: The code `done.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. Since `old` is defined as `a[r_end + 1 - m]`, the value of `done` is updated by removing `old` from it. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
