Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; if `old` is in `extra`, it is no longer in `extra` and `old` is either in `done` or added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `extra`, it remains in `extra` and `old` is either in `done` or added to `todo`.
