Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing the element `a[j]`, and `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Since `a[j]` is not explicitly given, we know it is one of the elements in the list `a`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 0, and all other variables retain their previous states.
