Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `ans` if the length of the set `done` is greater than or equal to the integer `k`. Otherwise, it assigns `0` to `ans`. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, along with the list `a` and the integer `m`, remain unchanged from their initial states.
