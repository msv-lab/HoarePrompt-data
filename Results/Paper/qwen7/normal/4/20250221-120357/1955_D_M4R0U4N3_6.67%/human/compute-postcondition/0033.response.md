Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, and `old` is no longer in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously in `extra`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in `extra`. All other variables retain their previous values.
