Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`, `old` is no longer in `done`.**

Explanation: The code `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `done`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is still equal to `m`, `m` and `n` remain integers with `m <= n`, `old` is still the value of `a[r - m]`, `old` is still not in `extra`, but now `old` is no longer in `done`.
