Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]`, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[j]` to the `extra` set. Given that `j` is 0, `a[j]` is the first element of the list `a`. All other variables retain their original values.
