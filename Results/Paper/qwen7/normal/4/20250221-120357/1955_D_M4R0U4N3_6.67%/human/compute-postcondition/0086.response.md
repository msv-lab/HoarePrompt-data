Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; if `old` is in `extra`, `extra.remove(old)` is executed and `old` is no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` is in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `todo` now contains `old`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
