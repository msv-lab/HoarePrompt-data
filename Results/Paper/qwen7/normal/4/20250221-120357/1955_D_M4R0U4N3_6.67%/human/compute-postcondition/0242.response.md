Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.
- If `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`.
- If `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`.
- If `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`.
- If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
- If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and may or may not be in `extra` or `done` depending on the conditions mentioned.
- The length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Loop Head
```
for r in range(m, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
1. **Variable `r`:**
   - The loop variable `r` starts from `m` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` was some value `r_end`.
   - For the next iteration, `r` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` will be `r_end + 1`.

2. **List `a`:**
   - The value of `a[r]` may change depending on the loop body, but the problem does not specify what happens inside the loop body.
   - Therefore, we cannot make assumptions about `a[r]` without knowing the loop body. We will keep it as `a[r]` where `r` is now `r_end + 1`.

3. **Set `extra`:**
   - The set `extra` may change based on the value of `old` and its presence in `extra`.
   - Since `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and `r` will be `r_end + 1`, the new value of `old` will be `a[(r_end + 1) - m] = a[r_end + 1 - m]`.
   - If `old` is found in `extra`, it will be removed from `extra`.

4. **Set `done`:**
   - The set `done` may change based on the value of `a[r]` and its presence in `todo`.
   - Since `a[r]` is in `todo` (if it was), it will be removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - The length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Set `todo`:**
   - The set `todo` may change based on the value of `old` and its presence in `done`.
   - If `old` is found in `done`, it will be added to `todo`.
   - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it will be removed from `todo` and added to `done`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `r` is `r_end + 1`.
- `old` is `a[r_end + 1 - m]`.
- `extra` has `old` removed if it was present.
- `done` has `a[r_end + 1]` added if it was in `todo`.
- `todo` has `old` added if it was in `done` and `a[r_end + 1]` removed if it was in `todo`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r_end + 1 - m]`, `extra` is `extra - {old}` if `old` was in `extra`, `done` is `done + {a[r_end + 1]}` if `a[r_end + 1]` was in `todo`, `todo` is `todo - {a[r_end + 1]}` if `a[r_end + 1]` was in `todo` and `todo + {old}` if `old` was in `done`. The length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
