Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`.**

This means that `remaining_cells` is calculated based on the value of `y`. If `y` is even, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4`. If `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`. All other variables retain their initial states.
