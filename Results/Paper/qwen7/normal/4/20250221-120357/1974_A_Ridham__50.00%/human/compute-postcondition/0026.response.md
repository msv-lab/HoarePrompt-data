Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a placeholder used when the loop variable is not needed. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `n`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `n` should be `n - 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` should be `n - 1`.

The other variables (`remaining_cells`, `t`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`) do not change within the loop head and are not part of the loop condition.

**Final State**:
State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`); `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`.**
