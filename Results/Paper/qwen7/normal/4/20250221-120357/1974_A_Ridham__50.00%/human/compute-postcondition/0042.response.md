Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` and `n`. Since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, it doesn't affect the loop condition. The key variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `n > 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was greater than 0, and now `n` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: Since the loop continues if `n - 1` is still greater than 0, we need to decrement `n` by 1.

4. **Other variables**: All other variables (`remaining_cells`, `t`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space`, `extra_screen`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect the loop continuation condition.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `remaining_cells` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` is decremented by 1.
- `result` remains the same.
- `space_x` remains the same.
- `space_y` remains the same.
- `total_space` remains the same.
- `screen_require_for_y` remains the same.
- `extra_space` remains the same.
- `extra_screen` remains the same.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing two elements, either `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `space_x % 15 == 0`, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`.**
