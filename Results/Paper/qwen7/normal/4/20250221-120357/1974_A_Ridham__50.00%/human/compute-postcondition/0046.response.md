Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing two elements, either `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`**.

Explanation: The code updates `total_space` to be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
