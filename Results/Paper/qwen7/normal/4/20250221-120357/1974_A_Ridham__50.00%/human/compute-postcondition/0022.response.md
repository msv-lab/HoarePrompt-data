Output State: **`extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `result` is an empty list; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`; `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`; `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`; `space_x` is not divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
