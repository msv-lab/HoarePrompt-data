Output State: **`screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, and the current value of `y` is even.**

Explanation: The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` assigns the value of `y // 2` (integer division of `y` by 2) to the variable `screen_require_for_y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
