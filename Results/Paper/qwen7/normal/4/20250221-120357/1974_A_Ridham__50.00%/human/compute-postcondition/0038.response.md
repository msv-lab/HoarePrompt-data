Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` as `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `extra_screen` is included in the output state.
