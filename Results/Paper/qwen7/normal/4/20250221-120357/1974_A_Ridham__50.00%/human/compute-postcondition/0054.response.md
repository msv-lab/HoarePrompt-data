Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing two elements, either `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`**

Explanation:
- The variable `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. Since `extra_space` is defined as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` becomes `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`.
- The value of `extra_screen` is updated to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, which means it is the integer division of `extra_space` by 15 plus 1. This does not affect the values of the other variables listed.
