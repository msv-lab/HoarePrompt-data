Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells`. Since `space_x` is `x * 1` (which simplifies to `x`) and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is updated to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
