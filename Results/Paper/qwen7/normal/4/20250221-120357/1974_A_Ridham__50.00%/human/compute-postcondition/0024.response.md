Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `result` is a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`; `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

The code appends `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. Since `result` was initially an empty list, now it contains one element, which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
