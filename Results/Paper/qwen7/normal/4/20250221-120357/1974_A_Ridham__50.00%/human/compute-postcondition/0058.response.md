Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `n` has been reduced to 0. At this point, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is 0. The `result` list contains up to `n` elements, which are either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions provided within the loop. Each element in `result` corresponds to the outcome of each iteration of the loop, with `screen_require_for_y` being `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` being calculated as described. The `space_x` and `space_y` variables reflect the last input values of `x` and `y` processed by the loop, and `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`. The `remaining_cells` and `extra_space` variables are no longer relevant since the loop has completed.
