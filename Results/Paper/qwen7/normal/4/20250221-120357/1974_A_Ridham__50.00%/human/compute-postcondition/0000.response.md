Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state where it is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
