Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing two elements, either `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`**.

In simpler terms, the extra space (`extra_space`) is now calculated as the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`, which is `space_x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
