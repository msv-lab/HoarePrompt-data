Output State: **`frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1 to become `k`, `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`, which means it increments the existing value by 1 to become `k`. The value of `num` remains the next element in `arr`, and the initial state of `frequency_table[num]` being incremented by 1 is no longer relevant since it has already been updated to `k`.
