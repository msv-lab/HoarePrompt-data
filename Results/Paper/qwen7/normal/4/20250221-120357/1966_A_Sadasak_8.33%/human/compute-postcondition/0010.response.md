Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body updates the `frequency_table[num]` based on the value of `k`. Specifically, `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k` if it is greater than `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k` if it is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `num` is the next element in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `arr`.
   - The state of `frequency_table` does not change based on the loop head alone; it changes inside the loop body depending on the value of `num` and `k`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `num`, which should be the next element in `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`frequency_table[num]` is set to `k` if it is greater than `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. `num` is the next element in `arr`**. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`frequency_table[num]` is set to `k` if it is greater than `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. `num` is the next element in `arr`**.
