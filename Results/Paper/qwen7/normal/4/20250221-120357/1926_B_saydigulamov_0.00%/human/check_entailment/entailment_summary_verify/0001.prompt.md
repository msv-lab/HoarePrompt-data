You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'). It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in a list. If the first two counts in the list are equal, it prints the list. The function does not return any value but prints the list of counts if the specified condition is met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires determining whether a given binary grid contains a square or a triangle.
   - A square is defined by `k` consecutive rows, each containing `k` consecutive `1`s at equal distances from the left edge.
   - A triangle is defined by `k` consecutive rows, where the `i`-th row contains `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s centered in one column.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - For each row, it checks if there is any `1` and counts the number of `1`s in that row.
   - If the first row has `1`s, it appends the count of `1`s in that row to the list `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `k`.

3. **Issues in the Given Program**:
   - The program does not check if the grid forms a square or a triangle.
   - The program only checks if the first row has `1`s and counts them, but it does not verify the pattern required for a square or a triangle.
   - The program does not handle the specific patterns required for a square or a triangle.
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to identify the shapes (square or triangle) based on the grid pattern.
