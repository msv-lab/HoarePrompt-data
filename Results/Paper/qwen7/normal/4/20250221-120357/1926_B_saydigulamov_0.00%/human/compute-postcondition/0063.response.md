Output State: **`b` is the new input string provided by the user; `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the string `b` plus one.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1's in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is the new input string, the count of '1's in `b` is added to `k`. Therefore, the updated state of `k` is a list containing the original count of '1's in `b` plus one (the newly appended count).
