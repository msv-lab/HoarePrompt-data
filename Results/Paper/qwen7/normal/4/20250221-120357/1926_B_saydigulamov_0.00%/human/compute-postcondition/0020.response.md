Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, i is the total number of iterations (which is equal to the integer input from the user), k is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in all the input strings b, and b and loop_count are the last input string and integer respectively. The first and second elements of k are equal.**
