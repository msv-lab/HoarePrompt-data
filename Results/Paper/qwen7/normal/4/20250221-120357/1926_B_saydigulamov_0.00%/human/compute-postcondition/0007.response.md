Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`, `b` is an input string. If the string `b` contains the character '1', `k` will have the count of '1'. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.
