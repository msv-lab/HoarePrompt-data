Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`, `b` is an input string containing the character '1'.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` contains the character '1', `b.count('1')` returns 1. Therefore, `k` now contains the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
