Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` must be within the range [1, n-1]
- `n` must be at least 2

We need to determine the values of `v1` and `prev` to understand what will be printed. However, these values are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their specific values. 

Given this, the print statement will output a formatted string with placeholders for `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]**
