Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prev` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `i`, `n`, `v2`, or `v1`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `prev` and retains the original values of `i`, `n`, `v2`, and `v1`.
