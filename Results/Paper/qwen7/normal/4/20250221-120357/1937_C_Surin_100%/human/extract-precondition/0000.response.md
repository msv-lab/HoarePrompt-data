Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to determine the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) through a series of queries. The input variables are the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, the size of the permutation \( n \).**
