Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input string from the user, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 2, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` must still be greater than 2, `r` remains the input string from the user, `v2` is now 3, `v1` is still 2, `prev` is still 1, `kp` is still 0, and `g` is still 0.
