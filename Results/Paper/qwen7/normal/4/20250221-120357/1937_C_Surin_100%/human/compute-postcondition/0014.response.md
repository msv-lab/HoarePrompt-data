Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `v2` is 1
   - `v1` is 1
   - `r` is equal to '<' if the condition `r == '<'` is true (though this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 1, `v1` is 1**
