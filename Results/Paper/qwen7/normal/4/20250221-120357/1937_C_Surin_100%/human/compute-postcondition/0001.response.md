Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `R` is a lambda function that returns an integer obtained from input**.

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes an integer input using `int(input())`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `I`, but it changes what `R` does. Therefore, `t` remains the number of test cases, and `R` is now defined as described.
