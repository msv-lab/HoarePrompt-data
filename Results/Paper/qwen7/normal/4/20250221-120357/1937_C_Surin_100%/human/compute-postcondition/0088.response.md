Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is at least 2) to the variable `n`. All other variables (`i`, `r`, `v2`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
