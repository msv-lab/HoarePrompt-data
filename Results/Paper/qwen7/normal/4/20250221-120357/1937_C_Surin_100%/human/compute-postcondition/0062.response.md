Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, `r2` is an input string**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) to the variable `prev`. The values of `n`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is now equal to `i`, which was `i + 1` before the assignment.
