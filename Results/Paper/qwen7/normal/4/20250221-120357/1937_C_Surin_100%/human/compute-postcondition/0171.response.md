Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for kp in range(int(input())):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `kp` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `kp` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` is greater than 5
   - `prev` is either 5 or 6

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `kp` starts from 0 (as per the `range` function) and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is 6 at the end of the previous iteration, `kp` must have been 5 in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented to 6.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` remains 6.
- `n` remains greater than 5.
- `prev` remains either 5 or 6.
- `kp` is incremented to 6.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than 5, `prev` is either 5 or 6, `kp` is 6, `int(input())` must be greater than 6**.
