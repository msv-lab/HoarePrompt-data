### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation \(p\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a lambda function to read input values.
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables and performs queries to determine the permutation \(p\).
   - The program attempts to identify the largest possible XOR value by comparing bitwise OR results.

3. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - **Initialization**: Sets up the number of test cases and the size of the permutation \(n\).
   - **First Loop**: For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\) with \((p_{v2} \mid p_{v2})\) and updates \(v1\) if the latter is greater.
   - **Second Loop**: Compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_{i})\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\) and updates `prev` if the former is greater. It also checks equality and updates accordingly.
   - **Final Output**: Prints the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly initializes and iterates over the test cases.
   - The logic for determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) seems to follow the problem constraints.
   - The number of queries is within the limit of \(3n\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles different permutations and ensures that the maximum XOR is found.
   - The use of bitwise operations and comparisons is appropriate for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to follow the problem's requirements and constraints. It correctly identifies the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) using at most \(3n\) queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
