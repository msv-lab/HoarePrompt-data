Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` must be at least 6.
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `prev` is `n - 1`.

2. **Substitute Values**:
   - Since `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 6.
   - Therefore, `v2 = n - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`.
   - `v1 = n - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`.
   - `prev = n - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(f'! {prev} {v1}')`.
   - Substituting the values, it becomes `print(f'! 5 5')`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The formatted string will be `! 5 5`.

Output: **! 5 5**
