Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `prev` is 3, and `r` is '>'**

Explanation: The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still greater than 2, `prev` is now 3, and `r` remains as the input string '>'.
