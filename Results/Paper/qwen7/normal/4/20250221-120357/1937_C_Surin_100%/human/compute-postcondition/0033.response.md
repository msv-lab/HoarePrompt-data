Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means that `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `i` is initially `n-1`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(1, n)`. Since `i` is initially `n-1`, it needs to be adjusted to be within the range [1, n-1].
   - `n` must be at least 2 to ensure that the range `range(1, n)` is valid and non-empty.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be adjusted to be within the range [1, n-1].
- `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` must be within the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 2**.
