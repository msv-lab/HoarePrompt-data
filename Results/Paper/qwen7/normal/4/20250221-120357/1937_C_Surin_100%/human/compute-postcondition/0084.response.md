Output State: **i is 1, n is at least 2, r is an input string, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, prev is i.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 1 because it starts from `n-1` and gets decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1 (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`). The value of `n` remains at least 2 as it was initially. The variable `r` will be the last input received, which could be either '>' or '=' or '<'. The variables `v2` and `v1` remain unchanged at `n-1` since they are not affected by the loop. The variable `prev` will be equal to `i` after the final iteration of the loop.
