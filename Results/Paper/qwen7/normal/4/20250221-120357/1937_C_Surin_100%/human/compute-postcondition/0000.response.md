Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, for each test case, `n` is the size of the permutation determined by input, and `I` is a lambda function that returns a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `I` which takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers. However, it does not execute any queries to determine the permutation itself. The number of test cases `t` and the size of the permutation `n` for each test case are yet to be determined through input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is the number of test cases and for each test case, `n` is the size of the permutation, which will be determined later through input. The lambda function `I` is also defined and ready to be used for further input processing.
