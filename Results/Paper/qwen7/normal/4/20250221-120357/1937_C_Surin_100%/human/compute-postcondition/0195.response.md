Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 6 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `v2` is 3
- `v1` is 2
- `r` remains unchanged as it was input by the user (though its value is not relevant for this print statement)

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2` inserted into the placeholders. Specifically, it will print:
- The character '?'
- The value of `v1` (which is 2)
- Another instance of `v1` (which is also 2)
- The value of `v2` (which is 3)
- Another instance of `v2` (which is also 3)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
