Output State: **i is n, n must be at least 6, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, prev is n-1.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `n` must remain at least 6. The variables `v2` and `v1` both remain at `n-1` since they are not modified within the loop. The variable `prev` is set to `n-1` based on the conditions within the loop, but since the loop has completed, `prev` retains this final value of `n-1`.
