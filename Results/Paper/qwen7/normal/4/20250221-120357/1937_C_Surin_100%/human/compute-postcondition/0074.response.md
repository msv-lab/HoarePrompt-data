Output: **? i i prev prev**

Explanation:
- `i` is defined as `prev + 1`. Since `prev` is the previous value of `i`, this means `i` is one more than `prev`.
- `prev` is explicitly stated to be the previous value of `i`.
- The print statement uses `f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}'`, which will print the values of `i` and `prev` twice each.

Given the initial conditions, the print statement will output the values of `i` and `prev` as specified.
