Output State: **`i` is 3, `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<', and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '='**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `r2`, and `prev`. It only flushes the output buffer, which is an operation related to the standard output stream and does not change any variable values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `r2`, and `prev` remain the same as their initial states.
