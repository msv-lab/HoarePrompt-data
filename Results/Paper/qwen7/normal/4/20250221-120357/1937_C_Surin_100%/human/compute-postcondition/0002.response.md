Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for kp in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `kp` and the value returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `kp` starts at 0 (as per the `range` function).
   - The value of `int(input())` is determined by user input, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means that `int(input())` should be at least 1.
   - The variable `kp` will start at 0, so no adjustment is needed for `kp`.

5. **State the final state**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases (this is not directly involved in the loop execution).
   - `R` is a lambda function that returns an integer obtained from input (this is not directly involved in the loop execution).
   - The input for `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`R` must return an integer that is at least 1**
