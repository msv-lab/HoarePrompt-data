Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the provided state, `i` is initially 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **List the variables that need adjustment**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since `i` is already set to 1, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can start executing.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input string, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**
