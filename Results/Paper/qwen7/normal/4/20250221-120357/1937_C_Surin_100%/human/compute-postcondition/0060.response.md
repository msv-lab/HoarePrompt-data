Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i` from the previous iteration, no changes made by `sys.stdout.flush()`**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation that affects the execution flow but not the variables' values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
