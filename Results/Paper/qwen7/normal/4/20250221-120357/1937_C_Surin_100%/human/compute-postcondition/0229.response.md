Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `r` is an input string**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the initial state remains unchanged.
