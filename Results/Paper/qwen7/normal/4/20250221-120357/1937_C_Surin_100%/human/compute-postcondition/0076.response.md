Output State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`, `r2` is the new input string.**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r2`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
