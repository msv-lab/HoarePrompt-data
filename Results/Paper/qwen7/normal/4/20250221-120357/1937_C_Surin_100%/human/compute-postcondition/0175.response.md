Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 6.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will start when `i` is 1 and continue until `i` reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can run. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 5, the smallest possible value for `n` that allows the loop to execute is 6.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `n` to at least 6.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 6**
