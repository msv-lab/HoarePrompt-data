Output State: **i is n, n must be at least 6, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1, prev is n-1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written out to the terminal. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
