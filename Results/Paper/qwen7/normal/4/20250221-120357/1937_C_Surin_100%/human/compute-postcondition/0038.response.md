Output State: **`i` must be within the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, and the current value of `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is equal to `i`.**

The code assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since the initial value of `i` is within the range [1, n-1], and `n` is at least 2, `prev` now holds the same value as `i`. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it was an input string with the value '>'.
