Output State: **i is 6, n is greater than 5, and prev is either 5 or 6.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the final value of `i` will be `n`. Given that the loop has run three more times after the initial conditions were met, `i` will increment from 5 to 6. The value of `prev` will depend on the inputs received during the loop's execution. If `r` was '>' at any point, `prev` would be updated to the current value of `i`, which would be 6. If `r` was '=' followed by '<', `prev` would remain as it was before the update. Therefore, `prev` could either be 5 (if no '>' was encountered) or 6 (if '>' was encountered). The variable `n` must be greater than 5 because the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, and `i` starts from 1 and increments up to `n-1`.
