### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The solution involves comparing the original array with all possible substrings of the concatenated array (the original array repeated twice).

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if any substring of the concatenated array (`a + a`) matches the sorted version of the original array (`sorted_a`).
   - If such a substring is found, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If no such substring is found after checking all possible substrings, it returns `'No'`.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`), the array itself (`a`), and then calls `func_1(a)` to check if the array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - It collects the results and prints them out.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly checks if any part of the concatenated array can be rearranged to match the sorted version of the original array.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each array.
   - The overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
