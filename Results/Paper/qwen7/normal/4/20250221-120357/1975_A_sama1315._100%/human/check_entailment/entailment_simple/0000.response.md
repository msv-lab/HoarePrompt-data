### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the given array `a` can be split and rearranged into a non-decreasing order by checking if any rotated version of the sorted array matches a subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct. It concatenates the array with itself (`a + a`) and then checks if any subarray of length `n` (where `n` is the length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is correct. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the array length and the array itself, and then calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by rotation.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The main program calls `func_2`, which correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the appropriate results.
   - The program structure and logic align with the problem statement and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
