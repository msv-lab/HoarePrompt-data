Output State: **`idx` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` (where `idx` is currently 2) to `n` after converting it to an integer. Since `idx` is incremented by 1 during the assignment (as `data[idx]` is accessed), `idx` becomes 3. The other variables (`t` and `results`) remain unchanged.
