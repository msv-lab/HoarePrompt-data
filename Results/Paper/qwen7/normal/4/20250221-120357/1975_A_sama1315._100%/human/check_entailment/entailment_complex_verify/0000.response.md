### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the concatenated array `a + a` contains a subarray that matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. For instance, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Concatenating `a + a` gives `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, and it does contain a subarray `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`, but this does not mean the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - Function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles the input reading and processing, but it relies on `func_1` to determine the result, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, one needs to check if there exists a valid split point such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the end of the first part is less than or equal to the start of the second part.
   - This involves iterating through the array and checking if the array can be split at any point to form a non-decreasing sequence.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
