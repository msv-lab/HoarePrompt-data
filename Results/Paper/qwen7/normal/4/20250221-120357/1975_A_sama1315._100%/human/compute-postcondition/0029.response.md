Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of an array `a`, and an array `a` consisting of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function does not return any value but processes each test case according to the given constraints and relationships.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` indicating the number of such test cases, then for each of those `t` cases, it receives an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs without returning any value, adhering to the specified constraints and relationships.
