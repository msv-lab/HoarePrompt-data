Output State: **`idx` is 8 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is applied to the list `a`, which is derived from the list `data` starting from the element at index `idx` and taking `n` elements, converting them to integers using the `int` function. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
