Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
2. **Steps**:
   - `n = len(a)`: Get the length of the array.
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)`: Sort the array `a`.
   - `concatenated_a = a + a`: Concatenate the array with itself.
   - Loop through possible splits:
     - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, check if the subarray `concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)]` matches `sorted_a`.
     - If a match is found, return `'Yes'`.
   - If no match is found after the loop, return `'No'`.

**Issue with `func_1`**:
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the problem's requirement of splitting and swapping parts of the array. Instead, it checks if the entire array `a` plus itself can contain a sorted version of `a` as a subarray. This is not equivalent to checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Purpose**: This function reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.
2. **Steps**:
   - Read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Parse the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the size of each array `n`, and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, call `func_1` and store the result.
   - Print the results.

**Issue with `func_2`**:
- While the function correctly handles reading and processing multiple test cases, the underlying `func_1` is flawed as explained above.

### Conclusion
Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts, the overall program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**:
Correctness: **False**
