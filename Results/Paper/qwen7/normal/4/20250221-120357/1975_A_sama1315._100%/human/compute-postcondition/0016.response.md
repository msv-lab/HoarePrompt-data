Output State: **`idx` is 8 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` creates a list `a` by converting each element in the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` (inclusive) into an integer using the `map` function and then converting the map object to a list. The value of `idx` remains unchanged as it is just used as a starting point for slicing the list `data`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is used to determine the length of the slice. The value of `t` and the list `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
