Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is now 10 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

In this output state, the variable `idx` has been updated by adding `n` to its previous value, which was `10 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
