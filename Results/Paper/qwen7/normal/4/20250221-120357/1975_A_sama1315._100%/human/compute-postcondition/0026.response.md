Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is now 10 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`, and `results` has the additional element `result`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` adds the value of `result` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is `10 + n + n`, `n` is derived from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`. After appending, `results` contains the original return value of `func_1(a)` plus the new value `result`.
