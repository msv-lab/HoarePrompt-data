Output State: **`idx` is 8 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` appended.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `results` which now contains the return value of `func_1(a)`.
