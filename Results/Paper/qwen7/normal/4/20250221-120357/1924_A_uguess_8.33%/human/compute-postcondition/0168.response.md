Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a', and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the value of `'a'` to `tmp` because `i` is initially set to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
