Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1 << cur_ss`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by shifting `1` left by `cur_ss` positions. Since `cur` was originally `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, after this operation, `cur` becomes `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1 << cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.
