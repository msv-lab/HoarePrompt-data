Output State: **The final value of `i` is `k-1`, `cur` is an integer where the bits from 0 to `k-1` are not set (i.e., `cur` is 0), and `tmp` is 'c'**.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have taken on all values from 0 to `k-1`. The condition `if cur & 1 << i == 0:` ensures that `tmp` is updated with the character corresponding to the current value of `i` only when the bit at position `i` in `cur` is not set. Since `cur` starts as 0 and no bits are set during the loop, `tmp` will be updated to 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence, resulting in `tmp` being 'c' by the end of the loop. The value of `cur` remains 0 because no bits are set during the loop iterations.
