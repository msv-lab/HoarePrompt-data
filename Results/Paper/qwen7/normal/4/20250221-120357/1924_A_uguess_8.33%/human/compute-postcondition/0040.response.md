Based on the initial state described:

- `s` is a string where all characters have been processed.
- `cur` is reset to 0.
- `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).
- The count `cnt` is less than `n`.

The print statement `print('NO')` simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
