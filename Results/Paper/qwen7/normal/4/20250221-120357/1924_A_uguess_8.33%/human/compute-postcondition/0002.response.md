Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `i` remains 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers entered by the user.
