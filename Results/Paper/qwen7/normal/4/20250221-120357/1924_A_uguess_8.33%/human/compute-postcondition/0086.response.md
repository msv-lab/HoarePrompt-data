Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and `cur` remains unchanged as it is set to `(1 << k) - 1` in the if condition, meaning all bits up to the `k`-th bit are set. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` (where `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a') is already set in `cur`, `cur` remains unchanged. If not, `cur` remains unchanged as well since the if condition always evaluates to true and the update operation does not occur.
