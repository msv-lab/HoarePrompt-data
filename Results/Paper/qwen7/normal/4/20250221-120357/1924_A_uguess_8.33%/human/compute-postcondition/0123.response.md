Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is \(k-1\) if `cnt` >= `n`, otherwise `2k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being set to 0, while all other variables remain in their initial states as described.
