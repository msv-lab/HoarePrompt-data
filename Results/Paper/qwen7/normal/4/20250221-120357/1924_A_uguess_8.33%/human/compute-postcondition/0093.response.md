Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, or `cnt`. The value of `cur` is now explicitly set to 0, while the other variables retain their previous relationships and values.
