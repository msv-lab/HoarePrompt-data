Output State: **`i` is 1; `cur` is an integer where the bit at position 1 is not set; `tmp` is 'b'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ord('a') + i` equals `ord('a') + 1`, which is `98` (since `ord('a')` is `97`). The function `chr(98)` returns the character `'b'`. Therefore, `tmp` is updated to `'b'`. The values of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged.
