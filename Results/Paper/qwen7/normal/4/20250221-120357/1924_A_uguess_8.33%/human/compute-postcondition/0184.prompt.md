You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s in each test case consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final output state depends on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`. Here's a detailed description:
    #
    #- `t` is the initial input integer, representing the number of test cases.
    #- After processing all test cases, for each test case:
    #  - `n` is the number of times the pattern needs to appear.
    #  - `k` is the length of the pattern.
    #  - `m` is not used in the provided code and can be ignored.
    #  - `s` is the input string that was processed.
    #  - `cnt` is the count of times the pattern `(1 << k) - 1` was fully formed in the string `s`.
    #  - `cur` is the current bitmask value, which tracks the characters seen so far.
    #  - `tmp` is a temporary string used to store the last incomplete pattern.
    #  - `ans` is the final answer string, constructed based on whether `cnt` meets or exceeds `n`.
    #
    #If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO' followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows:
    #- A string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
    #- Followed by `tmp`, which is either an empty string or 'a' + `2k-1`.
    #- Followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times if `cnt` is less than `n`.
    #- Or 'a' repeated `n - 1` times followed by `tmp` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
    #
    #The final output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' answers followed by the corresponding `ans` strings for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers t, n, k, m, and a string s. It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified: if n and k are within the given range and m does not exceed the limit, it processes the string s which consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
