Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is \(k-1\)
   - `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `i` is not set
   - `tmp` is a character which is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`. Therefore, if `i` is currently \(k-1\), the next value of `i` would be \(k\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` will increment by 1, the new value of `i` will be \(k\).
   - The value of `cur` and `tmp` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be \(k\)
   - `cur` remains the same (integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) is not set)
   - `tmp` remains the same (ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is \(k\), `cur` is an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) is not set, `tmp` is a character which is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`**.
