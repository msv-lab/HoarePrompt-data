Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt` + 1, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `ss` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0. This directly updates the value of `cur`. The values of `cnt`, `cur_ss`, and `ss` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `ss` is noted to be the next element in `s`.
