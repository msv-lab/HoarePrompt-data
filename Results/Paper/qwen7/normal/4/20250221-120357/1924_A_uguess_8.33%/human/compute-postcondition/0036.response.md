Output State: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed, and `cur` is reset to 0. `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `cur` will be reset to 0 because it resets whenever it reaches \((1 << k) - 1\). The variable `cnt` will be incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\) during the loop's execution. All characters in the string `s` will have been processed by the loop.
