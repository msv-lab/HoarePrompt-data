Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the characters seen in `s` and checks if they form all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The bitmask approach is efficient for checking subsequences because it allows tracking the presence of each character in the sequence.
   - The program correctly handles the logic for determining if all possible strings of length `n` are present as subsequences.
   - If not all possible strings are found, it constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence and prints both 'NO' and the constructed string.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `cnt` (the count of complete patterns) is less than `n` correctly by printing 'NO' and constructing a string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The construction of the string `ans` ensures that it is the lexicographically smallest string that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the problem requirements: 'YES' if all possible strings are found, and 'NO' followed by a string that does not occur as a subsequence otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
