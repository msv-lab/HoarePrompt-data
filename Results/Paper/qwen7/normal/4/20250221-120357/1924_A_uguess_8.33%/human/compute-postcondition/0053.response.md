Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `cur` is the same as before, `tmp` is 'c'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp`. Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` equals `ord('a') + 2`, which is `97 + 2 = 99`. The `chr(99)` function converts the integer 99 back into its corresponding character, which is 'c'. Therefore, `tmp` is updated to 'c', while the other variables remain unchanged.
