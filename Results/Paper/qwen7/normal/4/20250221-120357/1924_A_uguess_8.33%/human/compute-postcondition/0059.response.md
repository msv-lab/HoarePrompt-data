Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `k-1`: This means `i` is assigned the value of `k-1`.
   - `cur` is 0: This means `cur` is assigned the value 0.
   - `tmp` is 'c': This means `tmp` is assigned the character 'c'.
   - `ans` is 'ca' * (n - cnt - 1): This means `ans` is a string consisting of the substring 'ca' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times. Here, `cnt` is not explicitly defined, but it must be a variable or constant that is known in the context.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(ans)`: This will print the value of `ans`.

Given the information, the value of `ans` is determined by the formula `'ca' * (n - cnt - 1)`. Since `cnt` is not explicitly defined, we will keep it as part of the expression.

Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of 'ca' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Output: **'ca' * (n - cnt - 1)**
