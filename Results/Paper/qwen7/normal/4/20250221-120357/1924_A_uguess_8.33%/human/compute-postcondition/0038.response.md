Based on the initial state described:

- All characters in the string `s` have been processed.
- `cur` is reset to 0.
- `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since no other variables or objects need to be evaluated, and the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
