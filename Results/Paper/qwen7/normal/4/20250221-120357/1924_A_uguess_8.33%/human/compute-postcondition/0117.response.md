Output State: **`i` is `2k-1`, `cur` is an integer where none of the bits from position `0` to `k-1` are set (i.e., `cur` is `0`), `tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is `0`, `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)`, and `ans` is concatenated with `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends a string consisting of `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to the existing value of `ans`. Given that `cnt` is initially `0`, the expression simplifies to `ans += 'a' * (n - 1)`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `ans` will contain `n - 1` occurrences of 'a'. All other variables (`i`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
