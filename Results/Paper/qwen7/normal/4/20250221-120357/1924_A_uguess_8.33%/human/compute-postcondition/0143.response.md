Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1 << cur_ss`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 1, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 2. All other variables (`ss`, `i`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
