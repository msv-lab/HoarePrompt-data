Output State: **`ans` is 'z' * cnt, `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\), `tmp` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times. Since `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` results in the character 'z', `ans` becomes 'z' repeated `cnt` times. The value of `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\). The value of `tmp` remains an empty string as it was not affected by the code.
