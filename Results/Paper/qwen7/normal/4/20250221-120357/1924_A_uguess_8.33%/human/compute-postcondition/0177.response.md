Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a' + \(2k-1\), and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`; `ans` is concatenated with `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += tmp` concatenates the value of `tmp` to the end of the string `ans`. Given that `tmp` is initially set to `'a' + (2k-1)`, the final value of `ans` will be the original string `ans` plus the character `'a' + (2k-1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
