Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a' + \(2k-1\), `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**

Explanation: The code appends 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to the end of `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, after appending 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, `ans` now has a total length of `cnt + (n - cnt - 1) = n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
