Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + (1 << ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` by adding \(1\) left-shifted by `cur_ss` (which is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`). Since `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Therefore, `cur` becomes `ord(ss) - ord('a') + (1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
