Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is \(k-1\), `t` must be greater than \(k-1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from input, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
