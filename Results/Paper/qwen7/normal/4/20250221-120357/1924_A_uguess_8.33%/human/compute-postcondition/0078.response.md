Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cur` is incremented by 1 and then shifted left by `cur_ss` if the condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to `False`.
- If the condition evaluates to `True`, `cur` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over each character `ss` in the string `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `ss` (which is the current character from the string `s`) and `cur` (the current value of the variable being modified).

2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - The condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` checks if the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` is set.
   - If the condition is `False`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and then shifted left by `cur_ss`.
   - If the condition is `True`, `cur` remains unchanged.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `cur` is modified based on the condition.

### Adjusting the State
- Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`, the character `ss` changes with each iteration.
- The variable `cur` is modified based on the condition, but it does not depend on `ss` directly. Therefore, the modification of `cur` does not affect the character `ss`.

### New State for Next Iteration
- The string `s` remains the same since the loop is iterating over its characters.
- The character `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
- The value of `cur` will be the updated value based on the condition from the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and `cur` is the updated value based on the condition from the previous iteration.**

Since the exact value of `cur` cannot be determined without knowing the specific string and the exact sequence of operations, we can represent it as "updated value of `cur`".

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and `cur` is the updated value of `cur`.**
