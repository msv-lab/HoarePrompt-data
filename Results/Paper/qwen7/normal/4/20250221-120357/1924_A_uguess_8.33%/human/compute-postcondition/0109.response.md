Postcondition: `i` is \(k\), `cur` is an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) remains not set, and `tmp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`. If the bit at position \(i\) (which is \(k-1\)) in `cur` is not set, then no changes are made to `cur` and `tmp` retains its original value.
