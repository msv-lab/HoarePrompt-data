Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'c', `ans` is 'ca' * (n - cnt - 1)**

Explanation: The code `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times to the end of the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially `'c'`, after executing this line, `ans` becomes `'c'` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
