Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Bitmask Logic**: The logic used to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s` using bitmasking is flawed. The current implementation checks if a specific combination of characters (using binary representation) is present in the string `s`, but it does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The approach to generate a missing subsequence is incorrect. It tries to find a missing character by looking at the least significant bit that is not set in `cur`, but this does not guarantee that the generated string will be a valid subsequence of `s`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the string `s` is too short to contain all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is not a subsequence, return "NO" and that string.
- If all strings are subsequences, return "YES".

Here's a more appropriate solution outline:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, subseq):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in subseq)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_possible_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        missing_subsequence = None
        for subseq in all_possible_subsequences:
            if not is_subsequence(s, subseq):
                missing_subsequence = subseq
                break
        
        if missing_subsequence:
            print('NO')
            print(missing_subsequence)
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This solution generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, checks each one against `s`, and prints the appropriate output.
