Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `i` is 9.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` is not explicitly given but is stated to be greater than or equal to 10.
   - `res` is 81. This value is not needed for the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part formats the string to include the value of `i` (which is 9) after the number 2. So, it becomes `'2 9'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function into separate arguments. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 10, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Given these details, the print statement will output the formatted string `'2 9'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **2 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... n**
