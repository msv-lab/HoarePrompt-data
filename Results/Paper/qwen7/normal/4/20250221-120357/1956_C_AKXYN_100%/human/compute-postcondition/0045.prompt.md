Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n+1`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4.

To calculate this, we observe the pattern in the loop. The loop updates `res` as follows:
\[ res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \]
For each iteration, `i` increases by 1. After 3 iterations, `i` is 4, so `n` must be at least 4. To find the value of `res` after all iterations, we need to sum up the terms until `i` equals `n`.

The formula for the sum can be derived as:
\[ res = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \]

For `n = 5` (since `i` goes from 1 to `n` and after 3 iterations `i` is 4, so `n` must be 5 for the next iteration):
\[ res = (1+1)(2*1+1) + (2+1)(2*2+1) + (3+1)(2*3+1) + (4+1)(2*4+1) + (5+1)(2*5+1) \]
\[ res = 2*3 + 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 + 6*11 \]
\[ res = 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66 = 160 \]

However, since the problem states the output after 3 iterations is 108, it implies `n` is actually 4 (as the pattern matches the given values). Therefore, continuing with `n = 4`:
\[ res = (1+1)(2*1+1) + (2+1)(2*2+1) + (3+1)(2*3+1) + (4+1)(2*4+1) \]
\[ res = 2*3 + 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 \]
\[ res = 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 = 94 \]

But since the problem states the output after 3 iterations is 108, we infer the correct `n` is indeed 4, and the next iteration would be `i = 5`:
\[ res = 94 + (5+1)(2*5+1) \]
\[ res = 94 + 6*11 \]
\[ res = 94 + 66 = 160 \]

Given the pattern and the problem constraints, the final value of `res` after all iterations is 360 when `n` is appropriately set to ensure the loop completes its iterations correctly.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n-2`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
