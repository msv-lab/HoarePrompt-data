Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` (which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)) will be inputted.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The key variable here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines whether the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range (i.e., \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)).
   - The initial state should reflect that the input value will be a valid integer within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is within the given range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
