Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to 1 (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to continue, `i` must decrease by 1. Thus, `i` will be `n-2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n-2`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4**
