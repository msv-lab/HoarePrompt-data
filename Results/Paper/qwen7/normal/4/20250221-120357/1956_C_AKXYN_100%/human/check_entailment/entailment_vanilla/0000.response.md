Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations.
2. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
3. The given solution initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row and column is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
4. The sum of the matrix after initialization is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \).
5. This sum is correctly calculated in the code.
6. The code prints the total sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
7. The operations are performed in reverse order, setting each row and column to their initial permutation values.

Let's verify the correctness of the solution step-by-step:
- The sum calculation: The formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \) is derived from the structure of the matrix where each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to \( j \). This results in a triangular sum pattern.
- The operations: The code performs \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the row or column to a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \). This ensures that the matrix is filled with the desired permutations.
- The number of operations: Since the code performs exactly \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, the total number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the problem constraints.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
