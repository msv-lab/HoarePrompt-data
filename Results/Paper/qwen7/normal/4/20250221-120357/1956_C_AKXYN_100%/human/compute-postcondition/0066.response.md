Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the print statement.
   - `i` is 8.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.
   - `res` is 81. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
   
2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 1. Since `i` is 8, this part of the string becomes `'1 8'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into separate arguments and prints them. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 10, for the sake of precision in the output.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- The string `'1 8'`
- Followed by the numbers from 1 to 10 (since `n` is at least 10).

Output: **1 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10**
