Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`, `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `0`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `res` is 140
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `n-2`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n-2`**
