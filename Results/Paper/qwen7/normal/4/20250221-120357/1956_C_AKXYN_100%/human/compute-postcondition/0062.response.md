Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `n` to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1. This means `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 360
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `i` is 10
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `res` is 81
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decreases `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 10 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 9.
   
5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` is now 9, the loop will still execute.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`. Therefore, `i` will be 9.
   - The other variables (`total`, `t`, `mat`, `res`, `n`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 9, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
