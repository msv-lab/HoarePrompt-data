Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0 in the range function).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < n`) must still hold true. Since `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is now 3, `n` must still be greater than 3.

Given these points, we can update the state as follows:

State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 9, `n` must be greater than 3**
