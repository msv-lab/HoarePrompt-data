Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range object defined by `range(n)`. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (as `range(n)` generates values starting from 0), we need to set `i` to 0 initially.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `res`, `t`, and `mat` are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop head itself. Thus, they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
