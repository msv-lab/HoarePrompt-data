Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted with the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, this part of the string will become `'2 n-1'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range object into individual arguments, resulting in printing the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Putting it Together:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'2 n-1'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given that `n` must be greater than 4, let's assume a specific value for `n` to illustrate. For example, if `n = 5` (which satisfies the condition \(n > 4\)):
   - `i` would be `5 - 1 = 4`.
   - The print statement would then output: `'2 4' 1 2 3 4 5`.

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we should express the output in a general form.

**Output:** **2 n-1 1 2 3 ... n-2 n-1**
