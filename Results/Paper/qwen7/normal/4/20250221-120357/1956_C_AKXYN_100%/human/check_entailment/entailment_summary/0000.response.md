Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The given program processes each test case by initializing an \( n \times n \) matrix with the identity permutation for each row.
3. The sum of the matrix after these operations will be the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, which is \( n^2 \).
4. The program calculates this sum correctly as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \) and prints it along with \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
5. The program then prints \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2, each setting the row or column to the identity permutation, which ensures the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
