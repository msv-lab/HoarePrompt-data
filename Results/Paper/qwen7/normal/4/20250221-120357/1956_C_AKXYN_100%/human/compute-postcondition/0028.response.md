Output State: **`res` is 0 plus (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 2, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\). Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression evaluates to \((1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6\). Therefore, `res` becomes `0 + 6 = 6`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `mat` remain unchanged, and the condition on `n` still holds.
