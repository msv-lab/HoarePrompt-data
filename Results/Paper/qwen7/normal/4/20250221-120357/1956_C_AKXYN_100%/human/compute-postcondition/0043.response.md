Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 360.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - Since `i` is defined as `n-2`, and `n` is greater than 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to be 5 (since it must be greater than 4). Therefore, `i = 5 - 2 = 3`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`. For `n = 5`, this will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted with the value of `i`. Given `i = 3`, this becomes `'1 3'`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range into separate arguments, resulting in `1 2 3 4 5`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Combining these, the print statement will output: `'1 3' 1 2 3 4 5`.

Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5**
