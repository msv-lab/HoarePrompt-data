State before the loop starts: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 10, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than 9.

The loop in question is:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the loop head and determine which variables need adjustment:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` equal to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches 0. Since the loop is specified to run in reverse order from `n` to 1, `i` must start at `n` and decrease to 1.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1, but since the problem states `n` must be greater than 9, we can confirm that `n` must be at least 10.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, we need to ensure that `i` starts at the correct value and that `n` is set appropriately to allow the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must start at `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 9.

Since the initial state already specifies that `i` is 10 and `n` must be greater than 9, no further adjustments are necessary for these variables.

However, we need to ensure that the loop will execute correctly based on the given constraints. The loop will decrement `i` from `n` to 1, and the loop will terminate when `i` becomes 0.

So, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute is:
State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 10, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**.

This ensures that the loop will start with `i` at 10 and `n` at least 10, allowing the loop to decrement `i` correctly and terminate when `i` reaches 0.
