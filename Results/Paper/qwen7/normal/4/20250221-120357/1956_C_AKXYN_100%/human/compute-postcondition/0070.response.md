Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns the result.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers t and n within specified ranges, and it processes these test cases according to some defined logic, ultimately returning the result of these operations.
