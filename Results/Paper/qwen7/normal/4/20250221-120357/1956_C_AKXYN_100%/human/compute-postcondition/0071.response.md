Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates the sum `res` of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, prints this sum along with `n << 1`, and then prints a sequence of operations involving the integers from 1 to `n`. The function returns the total sum of all `res` values across all test cases.**
