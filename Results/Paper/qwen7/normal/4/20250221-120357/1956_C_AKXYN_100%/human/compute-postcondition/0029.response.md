Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 0 plus (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1). This simplifies to `res` being 6.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1**
