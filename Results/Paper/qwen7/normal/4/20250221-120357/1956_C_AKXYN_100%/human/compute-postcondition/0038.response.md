Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 360.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `i` is `n`.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of this print statement:

1. `'2 %d' % i`: This part formats a string to include the value of `i` after the number 2. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this will result in a string like `'2 n'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments and prints them separated by spaces. The range starts from 1 and goes up to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be greater than 4, let's assume a specific value for `n` to illustrate. For example, if `n = 5`, then `i` would also be 5. Therefore, the print statement would output:

- `'2 5'` (from the formatted string)
- `1 2 3 4 5` (from the range)

Combining these, the output would be:

Output: **2 5 1 2 3 4 5**
