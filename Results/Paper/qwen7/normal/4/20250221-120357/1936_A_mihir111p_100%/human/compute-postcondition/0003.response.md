Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), all of which are non-negative integers less than \(n\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^4\). After printing these values, the function waits for user input and returns a non-negative integer between 0 and \(n-1\).**
