You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n and k, where n is between 2 and \(10^8\) and k is between 1 and \(4n - 2\). For each test case, it prints a calculated value based on the conditions: if k is 1, it prints 1; if k is less than or equal to 2n, it prints the ceiling of k/2; otherwise, it prints k/2 rounded down plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `1`. This is a special case where only one diagonal needs to be colored, and the minimum number of cells required is 1.
   - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program calculates the minimum number of cells needed using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`.

3. **Diagonal Consideration**:
   - The problem states that a grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - The logic in the program seems to consider the number of diagonals that need to be colored, but it does not fully account for the structure of the diagonals in the grid.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Case 1: \( k == 1 \)
- The program correctly prints `1` when \( k == 1 \).

#### Case 2: \( k \leq 2n \)
- The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` is used here.
- This formula assumes that each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). However, this is not always true because some diagonals overlap.

#### Case 3: \( k > 2n \)
- The formula `k // 2 + 1` is used here.
- This formula suggests that each cell covers 2 diagonals, which is an over-simplification. Some diagonals may require more than one cell to be covered.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
   - Expected output: `2`
   - Explanation: Coloring 2 cells can cover 4 diagonals.

2. **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - Expected output: `2`
   - Explanation: Coloring 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

3. **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
   - Expected output: `6`
   - Explanation: Coloring 6 cells can cover all 10 diagonals.

4. **Example 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
   - Expected output: `5`
   - Explanation: Coloring 5 cells can cover 9 diagonals.

5. **Example 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
   - Expected output: `4`
   - Explanation: Coloring 4 cells can cover 7 diagonals.

6. **Example 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
   - Expected output: `6`
   - Explanation: Coloring 6 cells can cover 11 diagonals.

7. **Example 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - Expected output: `2`
   - Explanation: Coloring 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the complexity of covering diagonals in the grid. The formulas used in the program do not accurately reflect the minimum number of cells required to cover the specified number of diagonals. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
