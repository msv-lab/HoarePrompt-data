Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input from the next iteration, `k` is the second integer input from the previous iteration, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
