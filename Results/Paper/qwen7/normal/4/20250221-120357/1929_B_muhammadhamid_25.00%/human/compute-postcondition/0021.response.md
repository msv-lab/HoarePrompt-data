Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1.
- We continue the loop with the next input being an integer, updating `n` to this new integer and updating `k` to the second integer input.

However, the specific value of `k` that will be used in the `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement is not explicitly stated in the initial conditions. Since `k` is initially set to 1 and it is updated to the second integer input during the loop, the value of `k` used in the print statement will be the second integer input from the user.

Given that the initial value of `k` is 1, and it gets updated to the second integer input, let's denote the second integer input as `second_integer`.

Therefore, the value of `k` in the `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will be `second_integer`.

Output: **math.ceil(second_integer / 2)**
