Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input from the next iteration, `k` is the second integer input from the previous iteration, and `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the integers separated by a space from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
