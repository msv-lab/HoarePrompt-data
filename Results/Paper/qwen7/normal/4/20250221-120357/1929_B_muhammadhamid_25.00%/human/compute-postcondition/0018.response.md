Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1, and the next input is an integer, `n` is an integer input, `k` is updated to the second integer input, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, or `k` within the loop (other than the initial assignment of `k`), these variables retain their initial values. The loop continues, meaning that the next input will be processed in the same manner as the previous one.
