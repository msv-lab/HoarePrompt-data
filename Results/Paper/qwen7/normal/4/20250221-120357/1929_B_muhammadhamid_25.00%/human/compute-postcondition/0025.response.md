Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `range(int(input()))`, which means the loop will run for as many times as the integer input provided.
   - The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables, but it implies that the loop will take an integer input each time it runs.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
   - `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1.
   - The next input is an integer, `n` is an integer input, and `k` is updated to the second integer input.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop takes an integer input each time it runs, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for the next iteration.
   - After the loop runs once, `k` is updated to the second integer input, and the next input is taken for the next iteration.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` is the integer input for the next iteration.
   - `k` is updated to the second integer input from the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer input for the next iteration, `k` is the second integer input from the previous iteration.**
