Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple (1, 0), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is now an empty set excluding the element 1, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 2, `r` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `visited.remove(x)` removes the element `x` from the `visited` set. Since `x` is 1, the `visited` set, which was initially empty, now contains no elements, effectively making it an empty set again. All other variables remain unchanged.
