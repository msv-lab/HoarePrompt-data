Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, and `n` is the number of vertices in the tree.**

Explanation: The code initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. The other variables (`A`, `g`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
