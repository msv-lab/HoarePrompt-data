Output State: **`g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.**

This means that the stack now has an additional tuple containing the values of `node` and `x` appended to it, while the other variables remain unchanged with their previous conditions.
