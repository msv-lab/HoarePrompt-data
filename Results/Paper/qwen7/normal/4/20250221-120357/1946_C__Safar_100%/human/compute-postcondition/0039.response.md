The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting vertices `a` and `b`.

After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions:
- If `k` is greater than `n-1`, the function returns an error message indicating that the number of edges to remove cannot exceed the number of edges in the tree.
- Otherwise, the function returns the list of edges after removing `k` edges from the original list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of edges. It then returns the list of edges after removing `k` edges, or an error message if `k` exceeds the number of edges in the tree.
