Output State: **`g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` contains an additional tuple `(node, x)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack`. Since `g[1]` contains at least one element and `node` is not equal to `p`, these conditions remain unchanged. The `stack` now includes the new tuple `(node, x)`.
