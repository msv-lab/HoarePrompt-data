Postcondition: **`stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 2 (since `d[x]` is incremented by `d[x]` if `d[x] >= A`), `r` is 0.**
