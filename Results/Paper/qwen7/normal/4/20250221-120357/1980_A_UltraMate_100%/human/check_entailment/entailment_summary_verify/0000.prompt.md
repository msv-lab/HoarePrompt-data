You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Example

Input

    10 1
    
    BGECDCBDED
    
    10 2
    
    BGECDCBDED
    
    9 1
    
    BBCDEFFGG

Output

    2
    5
    1

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and a string \( a \) consisting of \( n \) characters from 'A' to 'G'. It then calculates the sum of \( m - \text{count}(i) \) for all unique characters \( i \) in the string \( a \) where the count of \( i \) is less than \( m \). Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round has at least one problem of each difficulty level. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that once a required difficulty level is met for a round, it does not need to be repeated in subsequent rounds. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
7 2
ABCDEFED
5 2
ABCDE
6 2
ABCDEF
```

- For the first test case, the program calculates that 4 additional problems are needed, but only 2 are actually required since 'A' and 'E' are already present in sufficient quantity for both rounds.
- For the second test case, the program calculates that 3 additional problems are needed, but only 1 is actually required since 'A' is already present in sufficient quantity for both rounds.
- For the third test case, the program calculates that 1 additional problem is needed, which is correct.

The program fails to correctly handle cases where certain difficulty levels are already available in sufficient quantity for all rounds, leading to an overestimation of the number of additional problems needed.
