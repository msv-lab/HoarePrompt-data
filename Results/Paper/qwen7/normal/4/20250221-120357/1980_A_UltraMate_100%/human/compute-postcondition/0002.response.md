Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the integers entered by the user.
