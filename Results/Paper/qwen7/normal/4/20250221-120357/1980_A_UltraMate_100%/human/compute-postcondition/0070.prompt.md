Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `ans` will be `m * len(p)`, assuming all characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') are not in `hmp`. The variable `p` remains unchanged as 'ABCDEFG', and all other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`, `t`, `s`, `hmp`) maintain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be `m` multiplied by the length of the string `p`, which is 7. This is because the loop increments `ans` by `m` for each character in `p` that is not found in `hmp`. If none of the characters in `p` are in `hmp`, `ans` will be `7 * m`. The string `p` remains 'ABCDEFG', and the other variables retain their states from the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` retains its state from the last iteration, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `m`, `n`, `t`, `s`, and `hmp` retain their states from the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` retains its state from the last iteration, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `m`, `n`, `t`, `s` retain their states from the last iteration. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `m`, `n`, `t`, `s` retain their states from the last iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
