Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \), and the string \( a \) which represents the difficulties of the problems.
3. It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string \( a \).
4. The program then iterates over the difficulty levels 'ABCDEFG'.
   - If a difficulty level is not present in the string \( a \), it adds \( m \) to the answer because Vlad needs to create \( m \) problems of that difficulty.
   - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than \( m \), it adds the difference \( m - \text{count}(i) \) to the answer.
5. The final result is printed for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can conduct \( m \) rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
