Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each key in the dictionary `hmp`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second key in `hmp`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next key in the dictionary.
   - **`hmp`**: The dictionary `hmp` retains its state from the last iteration, meaning no changes are made to it within the loop.
   - **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on the condition `if hmp[i] < m: ans += m - hmp[i]`. However, since we are determining the state before the update, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - **`p`**: The variable `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and does not change within the loop.
   - **`m`, `n`, `t`, `s`**: These variables retain their states from the last iteration.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i` to the next key in `hmp`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `hmp` retains its state from the last iteration, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `m`, `n`, `t`, `s` retain their states from the last iteration**.
