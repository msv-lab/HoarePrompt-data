Output State: **`ans` is `m * len(p)`, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `i` is in its final state, `m` is in its final state, `n` is an input integer, `s` is in its final state, `hmp` is in its final state, `t` is `t - 1`**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. However, since the initial values of `i`, `s`, `hmp`, and `t` are not specified and no further operations are performed on these variables, their states remain unchanged. The value of `ans` remains as `m * len(p)` because `len(p)` is 7 ('ABCDEFG' has 7 characters), and `p` itself remains 'ABCDEFG'. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1` due to the operation in the initial state.
