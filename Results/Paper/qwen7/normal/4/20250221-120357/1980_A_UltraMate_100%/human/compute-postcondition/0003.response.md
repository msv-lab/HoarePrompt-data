Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `s` is a string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the string input by the user to the variable `s`. The preconditions for `t` and the integer values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
