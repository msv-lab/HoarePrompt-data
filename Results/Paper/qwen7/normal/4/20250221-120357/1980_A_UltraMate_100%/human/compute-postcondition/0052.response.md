Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is an undefined variable plus `m`.**

The code `ans += m` attempts to add the value of `m` to `ans`. However, since `ans` is undefined in the initial state, the operation cannot be performed directly. The output state retains the initial values of `i` and `p`, and indicates that `ans` remains undefined as no value was assigned to it.
