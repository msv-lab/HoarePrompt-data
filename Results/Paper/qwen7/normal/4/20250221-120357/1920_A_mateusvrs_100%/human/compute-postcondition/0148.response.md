Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is either 1 or -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is either 1000000000 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial conditions for `n`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `t`, `ax`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `a` and `x`.
