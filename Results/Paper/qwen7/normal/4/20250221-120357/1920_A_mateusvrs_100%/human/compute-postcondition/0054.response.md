Output State: **`cx` must have at least one unique `x` value, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `tmp` will be increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, the increment operation does not depend on the current value of `tmp`. The other variables (`cx` and `i`) remain unchanged.
