Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`. Additionally, the condition `bx > ax` is true.**
