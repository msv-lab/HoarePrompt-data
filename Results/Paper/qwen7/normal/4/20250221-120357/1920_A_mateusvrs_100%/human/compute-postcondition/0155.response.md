Postcondition: **`n` is equal to the total number of iterations executed, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `a` is the last input integer, and `x` is the last input integer. The current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`.**
