Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `cx`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `cx` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, for the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will now be the next element in `cx`.
   - The value of `tmp` will either remain unchanged or increase by 1 depending on the condition (if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `cx` and `i`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `cx` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.

Since the exact values of `cx` and `i` are not specified, we can only state the conditions they must satisfy.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `cx`**.
