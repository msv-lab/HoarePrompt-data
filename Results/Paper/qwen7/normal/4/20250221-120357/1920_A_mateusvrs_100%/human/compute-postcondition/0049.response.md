Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, the variable `tmp` is incremented.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` must have at least one unique `x` value.
   - The loop condition checks if `i` (an element from `cx`) is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `cx`, we need to consider the next element in `cx`.
   - The postcondition ensures that `cx` has at least one unique `x` value, so there will always be at least one element left to iterate over unless `cx` becomes empty.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cx` will still have at least one unique `x` value because it must have at least one unique `x` value.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`cx` must have at least one unique `x` value, `i` is the next element in `cx`**.
