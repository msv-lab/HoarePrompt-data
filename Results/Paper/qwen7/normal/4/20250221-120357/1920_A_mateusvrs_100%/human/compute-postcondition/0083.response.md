Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from the input; `x` is an integer from the input; `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current values of `x` and `ax`. The conditions and values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
