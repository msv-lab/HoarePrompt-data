Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Processing Constraints**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to a set `cx` of excluded values.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there are no feasible values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
4. **Calculating Valid Range**: If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` but are not in the set `cx` of excluded values.
5. **Appending Result**: The calculated number of valid integers is appended to the result list `r`.
6. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees provided (such as the existence of at least one constraint of type 1 and type 2, and no duplicate constraints), the program correctly handles all cases as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
