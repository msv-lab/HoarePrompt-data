Output State: **`n` must be equal to the total number of iterations executed, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `a` is the last input integer, `x` is the last input integer, `bx` is not greater than `ax`, `tmp` is 0.**

The code `tmp = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tmp`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `t`, `ax`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `tmp` is now 0.
