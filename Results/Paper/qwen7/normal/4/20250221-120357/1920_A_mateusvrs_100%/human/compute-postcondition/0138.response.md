Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is either 1 or -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is 1000000000 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 1, `bx` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.
