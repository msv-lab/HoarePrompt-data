Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it initializes variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` appropriately.
3. It processes each constraint, updating `ax`, `bx`, and adding `x` to `cx` based on the type of constraint.
4. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because there are no valid `k` values.
5. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of `x` values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`).
6. The final result is printed correctly.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
