Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is not 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, and `a` is not equal to 2**.

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
