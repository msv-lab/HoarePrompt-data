Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is `n - 1`, `cx` is a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is -1, `a` is either 2 or not 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `a` is updated to the first input integer, and `x` is updated to the second input integer.
