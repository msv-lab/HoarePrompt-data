Output State: **`counter` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', `i` is 1, the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]` or `i` is equal to `n-1` or the next element in `s1` is equal to the next element in `s2`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 0. After executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables (`counter`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`) remain unchanged. The condition regarding the elements of `s1` and `s2` also remains valid as it was a condition before the increment operation.
