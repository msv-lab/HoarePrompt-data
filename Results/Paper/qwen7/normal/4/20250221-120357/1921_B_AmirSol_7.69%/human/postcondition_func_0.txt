The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It counts and returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, following specific conditions. If `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are different, and either `i` is not the last index or the characters at `i+1` in both strings are also different and not equal to `s1[i]`, then it counts this as a valid mismatch. Otherwise, it counts it as a mismatch without the additional condition. After checking all positions, it returns the total count of valid mismatches.
