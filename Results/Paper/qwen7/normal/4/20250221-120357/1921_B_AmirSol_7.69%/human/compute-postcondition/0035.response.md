Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially 3, after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
