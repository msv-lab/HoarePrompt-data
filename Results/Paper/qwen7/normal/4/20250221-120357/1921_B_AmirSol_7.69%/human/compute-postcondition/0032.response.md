Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 2, `i` is 4, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The `counter` variable, which was initially incremented by 1, is incremented again by 1 due to the `i += 1` operation. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
