Postcondition: `counter` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', `i` is 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, the current value of `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i + 1]`.
