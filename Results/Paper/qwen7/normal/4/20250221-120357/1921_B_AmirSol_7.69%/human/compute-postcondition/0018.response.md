Postcondition: `counter` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', and `i` is 1.
