Output State: **`counter` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`; otherwise, `counter` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1. After executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
