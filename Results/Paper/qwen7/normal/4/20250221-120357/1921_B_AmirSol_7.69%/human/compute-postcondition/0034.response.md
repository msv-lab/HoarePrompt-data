Postcondition: `counter` is increased based on the conditions. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, then `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is set to 5. Otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 2 and `i` is set to 4. Both `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain as strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.
