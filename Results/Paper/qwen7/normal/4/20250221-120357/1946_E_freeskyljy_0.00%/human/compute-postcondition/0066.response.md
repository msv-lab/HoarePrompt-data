Output State: **`ans` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by multiplying its previous value with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `nums_left` is reduced by 1 due to this operation. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial state.
