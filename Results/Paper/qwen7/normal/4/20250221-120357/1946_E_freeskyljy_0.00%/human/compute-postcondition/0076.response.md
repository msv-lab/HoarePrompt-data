Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is either 2 or 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1, and if `i == R[cur]`, then `cur` becomes 2; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` reduces the value of `nums_left` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `nums_left` being reduced by 1, while `cur`, `i`, `N`, and `R[cur]` retain their previous conditions and values. The expression for updating `ans` also remains valid.
