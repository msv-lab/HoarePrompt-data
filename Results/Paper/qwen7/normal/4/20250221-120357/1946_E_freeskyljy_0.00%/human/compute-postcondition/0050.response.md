Postcondition: `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, `M2` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, `i` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.
