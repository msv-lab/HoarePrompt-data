Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given that `cur` was initially 1, after executing the code, `cur` becomes 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
