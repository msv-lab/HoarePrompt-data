Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs until `i` becomes 1. Since `i` starts from `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the number of iterations is `L[-1] - 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1) = L[-1] - len(L) + 1 - 1 = L[-1] - len(L)`, `i` will be 1, and `cur` will be `M1 - len(L)` as `cur` is updated by `-1` each time `i` matches `L[cur]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is only modified when `i` does not match `L[cur]`, and since `i` eventually reaches 1, it will match `L[cur]` on the last iteration, leaving `ans` as the initial value calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
    #State: `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, and `i` is 1. If `M1 > 1`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - len(L)`, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if (M2 > 1) :
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `nums_left` is 0, `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N - 1`, `i` is less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.
        #
        #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `nums_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until there are no more elements left. The value of `cur` will depend on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, as it increments `cur` only when `i` matches `R[cur]`. The variable `i` will be `N - 1` since it starts from `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `N - 1`. The condition `i < N` must hold true for the loop to complete its iterations. Additionally, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1` for the loop to start executing. Finally, `ans` will be the cumulative product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1`, taken modulo `MOD`.
    #State: `nums_left` is 0, `cur` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `i` equals `R[cur]` during the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N - 1`, `i` is less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` modulo `MOD`.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the product of all nums_left values from R[0] + 1 to N-1 modulo MOD.
