Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only used to indicate that it is an input integer in the initial state.
