Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a` is greater than 0.
- `s` is equal to the count of '@' characters in the string `b`.
- `b` is a non-empty string.
- The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement whenever a `*` followed by another `*` is encountered.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the count of '@' characters in the string `b`.

Since the exact content of `b` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of '@' characters in `b`. However, we know that `s` is the count of these characters.

Output: **s (where s is the count of '@' characters in the string b)**
