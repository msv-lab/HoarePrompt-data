Postcondition: `j` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, and if the character at index 0 of `b` is either '@' or '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index 3 of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, `j` remains 2 and `b` remains a non-empty string.
