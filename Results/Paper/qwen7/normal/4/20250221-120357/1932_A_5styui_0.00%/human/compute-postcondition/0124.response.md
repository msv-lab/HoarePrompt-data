Output State: **`s` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, and the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either '*' or '@'**.

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially set to 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise it was 0. After executing `s = s + 1`, `s` is now incremented by 1, making its value 2. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains the length of `b`. The character at index `j + 1` in `b` is still either '*' or '@', as the code did not affect the string `b` or the condition checking the character.
