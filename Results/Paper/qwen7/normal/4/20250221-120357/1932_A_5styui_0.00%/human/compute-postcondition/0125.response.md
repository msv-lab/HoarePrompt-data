Output State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1, while `i` is the length of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are exiting the context where `j` was being incremented and `s` was being set based on the character at index `j + 1` in `b`. The values of `i`, `b`, `d`, and the condition regarding the character at index `j + 1` in `b` remain unchanged.
