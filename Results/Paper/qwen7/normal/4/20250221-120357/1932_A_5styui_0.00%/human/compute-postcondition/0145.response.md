Postcondition: `s` is either 3 or 2 depending on whether the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the length of `b`. If the condition `b[j] == '@'` is true, then `s` becomes 3. Otherwise, `s` remains 2 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', or `s` is 1 if it is not.
