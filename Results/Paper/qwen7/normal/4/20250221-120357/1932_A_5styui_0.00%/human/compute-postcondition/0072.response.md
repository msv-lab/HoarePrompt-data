Postcondition: `j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index 0 of `b` is either '@' or '*'. If the character at index 0 of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the character at index 0 of `b` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the character at index 0 of `b` is neither '@' nor '*', the conditions remain unchanged.
