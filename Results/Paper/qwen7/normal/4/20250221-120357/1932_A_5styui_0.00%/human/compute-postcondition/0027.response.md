Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `j` in the range of the length of the string `b`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The string `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is 1 if the character at index `j` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 0.
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - The character at index `j` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1.
   - The value of `s` will depend on the character at the new index `j` of `b`.
   - The conditions for `t`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `s` is 1 if the character at the new index `j` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 1 if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+1` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`**.
