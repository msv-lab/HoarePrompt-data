Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is 3, `j` is 3, `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer.**

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues as long as it encounters the character '@' and increments `s`. The loop breaks when it encounters two consecutive '*' characters. Given that the loop has executed three times, it means it encountered '@' three times without encountering two consecutive '*' characters before the third iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `s` will be 3, and `j` will be incremented to 3 (since each iteration increments `j` by 1). The values of `i` (which is the length of `b`) and `d` (an input integer not affected by the loop) remain unchanged.
