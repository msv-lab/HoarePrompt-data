Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1` or remains `999999999999999999` if `i` is not less than `n - 1`; `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prog_cities[i] = 1` sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `back`, or `forward`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `back`, and `forward` remain as per their previous conditions.
