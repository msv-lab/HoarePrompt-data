Output State: **`i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, `back` remains unchanged. The absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back` is now equal to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged; `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `prog_cities[i]` to be the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. This changes the value of `prog_cities[i]`, but does not affect the values of `i`, `back`, or `forward`. The condition about the absolute differences between `cities[i]` and `back` versus `forward` remains true, but now both sides of the comparison are equal due to the assignment.
