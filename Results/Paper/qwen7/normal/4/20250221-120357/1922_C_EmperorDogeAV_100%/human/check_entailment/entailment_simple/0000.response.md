Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin and the cost of moving to any other city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - The main program processes multiple test cases, each with a set of cities and queries to find the minimum cost to travel between two specified cities.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the neighboring cities.
   - It handles edge cases where the current city is the first or last in the list by setting those positions to zero.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly reverses the list of cities and computes the prefix sums for both the original and reversed lists.
   - It then processes each query by determining whether to use the prefix sum from the original or reversed list based on the order of the query cities.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as per the problem statement.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided example and the logic in the main program align with the problem requirements.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the distances to the closest cities, and the main program uses these values to compute the minimum cost for each query.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
