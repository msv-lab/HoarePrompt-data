Output State: **`i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]`, and `i < n - 1` is satisfied.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to `cities[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `back`, and the condition `i < n - 1` remain unchanged from the initial state.
