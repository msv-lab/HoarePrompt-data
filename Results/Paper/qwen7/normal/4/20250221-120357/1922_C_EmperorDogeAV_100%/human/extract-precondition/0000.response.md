Precondition: **cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct indices x and y (1 <= x, y <= n) representing the starting and ending cities for the travel.**
