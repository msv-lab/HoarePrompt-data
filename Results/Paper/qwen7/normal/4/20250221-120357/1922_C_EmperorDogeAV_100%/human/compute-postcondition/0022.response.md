Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`**.

This means that the value of `back` has been explicitly set to -99999999999999999999, while the values of `i` and `forward` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `forward` retaining its condition of being the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`.
