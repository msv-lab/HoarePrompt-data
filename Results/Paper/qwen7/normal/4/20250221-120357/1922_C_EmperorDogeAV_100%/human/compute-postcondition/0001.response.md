Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop.
   - The loop runs from `range(n - 1)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, `i` should be set to 0 initially.

3. **Determine the Range Condition:**
   - The loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Check the State of `n`:**
   - The value of `n` must be such that `n - 1` is a valid non-negative integer. Given the constraint `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `n` must be at least 2.

5. **State of `prog_cities`:**
   - `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros. This state does not change based on the loop itself but is a given condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
