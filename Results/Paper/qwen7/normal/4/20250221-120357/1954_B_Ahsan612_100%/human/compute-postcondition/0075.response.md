Output State: **`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values from the precondition; `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since no specific initial value for `i` was given, we assume it retains its initial value from the precondition, which means it simply gets incremented by 1. All other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
