Postcondition: `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their initial values. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, `i` is increased by 1, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, and `same` is set to 1.
