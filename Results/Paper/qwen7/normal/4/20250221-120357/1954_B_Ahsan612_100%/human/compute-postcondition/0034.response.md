Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is 2 or `min(2, same)`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `same` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Since `same` was initially either 3 or 1, setting `same` to 1 does not change its possible values. The value of `minn` remains 2 or `min(2, same)` because `same` is now 1, and `min(2, 1)` is 1, but since the initial value of `minn` was 2 or `min(2, same)`, it stays as 2 or `min(2, 1)`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state.
