Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is equal to `ar[6]`, `minn` is 2, `i` is 6**.

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. Given that `same` is 2 and assuming `minn` was at least 2 (or possibly undefined initially), `minn` remains 2 after this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
