Output State: **`same` is 4 or 2 or 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is equal to `ar[i]` if `ar[i] == num` is true, otherwise `num` remains unchanged, `minn` is 2 or `min(2, same)`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being incremented by 1 while keeping all other variables in their original conditions.
