Output State: **`same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `ar`. This operation does not affect the values of `same`, `t`, `n`, `num`, `minn`, or `i` directly. However, it updates the value of `ar` to a new list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
