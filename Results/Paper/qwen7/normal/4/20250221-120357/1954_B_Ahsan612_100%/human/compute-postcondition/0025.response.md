Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is equal to `ar[6]`, `minn` is 2, `i` is 6**.

Explanation: The line `same = 1` changes the value of `same` from 2 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
