Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `minn` is infinity, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is either 2 or 3, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is incremented by 1, `same` is equal to 1, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, and `num` is not specified.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
