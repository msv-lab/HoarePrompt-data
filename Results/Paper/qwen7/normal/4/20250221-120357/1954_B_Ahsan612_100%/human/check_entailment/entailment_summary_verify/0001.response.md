### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the number to which the sequence is currently uniform (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array to find the shortest uniform sequence.
   - If the minimum sequence length is infinite (`inf`) or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum sequence length.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the shortest uniform sequence in the array.
   - However, the program does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the uniformity.
   - The program only finds the shortest uniform sequence but does not ensure that removing these elements will make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` has a shortest uniform sequence of length 2 (e.g., `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`). Removing one element (e.g., the third element) breaks the uniformity.
   - The program correctly identifies this but does not handle the removal of elements to break the uniformity.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary states that the function finds and prints the smallest number of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`. If no such sequence exists, it prints `-1`.
   - This summary aligns with the behavior of the given program, which indeed finds the shortest uniform sequence but does not ensure that removing these elements will break the uniformity.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It only finds the shortest uniform sequence without ensuring that removing these elements will break the uniformity.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not ensure that removing the identified uniform sequences will make the array non-beautiful. It only finds the shortest uniform sequence but does not handle the removal of elements to break the uniformity.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
