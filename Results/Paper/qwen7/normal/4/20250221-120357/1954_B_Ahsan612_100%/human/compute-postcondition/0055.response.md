Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i < len(ar)`.
   - The only variable involved in the condition is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i` and `ar`**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a string and converting each element to an integer. The length of `ar` is not explicitly given, but we know `i` starts at 1.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

4. **Current state of `i`**:
   - `i` is 1.

5. **Determine the required state of `ar`**:
   - To make `i < len(ar)` true, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 because `i` is currently 1.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that needs adjustment is `ar`. Specifically, `ar` must have more than one element for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than one element, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 1**.
