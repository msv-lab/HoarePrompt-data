Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1.
- `same` is equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num` is not specified.
- Either `minn` is infinity or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This means it will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
