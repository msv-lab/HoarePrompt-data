Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is set to infinity.**

Explanation: The code initializes `minn` to infinity (`inf`). This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `num` remain unchanged, and `minn` is now set to infinity.
