Output State: **`same` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than 3 elements, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. Since `same` was initially 2, it now becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
