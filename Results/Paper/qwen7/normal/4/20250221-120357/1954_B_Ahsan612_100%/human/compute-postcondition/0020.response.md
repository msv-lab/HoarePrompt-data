Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `same` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - `i` is either 2 or 4.
   - `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `same` is 2. If `same` is 1, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` where `i` is 4.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given that `i` is either 2 or 4, and assuming `i` is 4 (since `i` is 2 would mean the loop has already executed once), `i` needs to be incremented to 5 for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i` must be set to 5 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` must be set to 5.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is 5, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `same` is 2. If `same` is 1, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` where `i` is 4.**
