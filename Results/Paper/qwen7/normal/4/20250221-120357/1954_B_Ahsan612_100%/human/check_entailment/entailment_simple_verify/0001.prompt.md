You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`. If `minn` was infinity or equal to the length of `ar` at any point, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is the smallest value found during the loop execution. If no valid minimum consecutive occurrence was found, `minn` will be infinity, indicating that there were no repeating elements in the list `ar` that met the criteria. The final value of `minn` is either the smallest count of consecutive occurrences or infinity, depending on the input list `ar`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `minn` will hold the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in the list `ar`, or it will be infinity if no such sequence exists.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the number to which the sequence is currently uniform (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array to find the shortest uniform sequence.
   - If the minimum sequence length is infinite (`inf`) or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum sequence length.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the shortest uniform sequence in the array.
   - However, the program does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the uniformity.
   - The program only finds the shortest uniform sequence but does not ensure that removing these elements will make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` has a shortest uniform sequence of length 2 (e.g., `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`). Removing one element (e.g., the third element) breaks the uniformity.
   - The program correctly identifies this but does not handle the removal of elements to break the uniformity.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It only finds the shortest uniform sequence without ensuring that removing these elements will break the uniformity.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not ensure that removing the identified uniform sequences will make the array non-beautiful. It only finds the shortest uniform sequence but does not handle the removal of elements to break the uniformity.
