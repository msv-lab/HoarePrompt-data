Postcondition: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is the total number of occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `i` is the index of the next element in the list `ar` to be processed, and either `minn` is infinity or `minn` equals the length of the list `ar`.**
