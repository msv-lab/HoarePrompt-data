Output State: **`i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
