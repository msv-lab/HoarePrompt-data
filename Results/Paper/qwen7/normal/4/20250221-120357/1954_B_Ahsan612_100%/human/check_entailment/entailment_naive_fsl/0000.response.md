Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments of consecutive identical elements. Specifically, the program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and does not account for the possibility of removing elements from different segments to break the beauty condition.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct output should be `1` because removing the element at index 2 (value 1) would break the beauty condition. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly. It only considers the minimum segment length and does not ensure that the removal of elements from different segments is considered.

To fix this, the program needs to track the lengths of all segments of consecutive identical elements and ensure that the minimum number of elements to remove is calculated correctly by considering the overlaps between these segments.
