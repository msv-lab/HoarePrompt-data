Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is 3, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`infinity` initially) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Therefore, `minn` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
