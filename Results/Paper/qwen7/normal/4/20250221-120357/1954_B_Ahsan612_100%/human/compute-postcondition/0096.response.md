Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1.**

The variable `same` is initialized to 1, but none of the other variables (`ar`, `minn`, `n`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial states.
