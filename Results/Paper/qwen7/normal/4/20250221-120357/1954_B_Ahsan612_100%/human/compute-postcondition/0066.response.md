Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than one element, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2 if `ar[2]` was not equal to `num`, or `i` remained 1. After incrementing, `i` becomes 3 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, and remains 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
