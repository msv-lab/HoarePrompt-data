Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 1.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`.
- `b` and `c` are updated to their respective integer values from the input split.

The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `a`, `i`, `q`, `b`, or `c`, it will directly print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
