Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `a` is at least 1. If `a` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `a`, we need to ensure that `a` is at least 1. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` being at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be at least 1**
