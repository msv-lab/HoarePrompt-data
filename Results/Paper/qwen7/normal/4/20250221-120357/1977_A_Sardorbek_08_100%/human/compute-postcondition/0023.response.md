Postcondition: `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, and `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` does not equal `c`, then either `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd) or `b` is less than `c`.
