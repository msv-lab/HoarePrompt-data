Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is incorrect. This condition checks if the sum of the number of moves (`b`) and the desired number of cubes (`c`) have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), but it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

For example, consider the test case `(5, 3)`. According to the problem description, it should be possible to achieve 3 cubes after 5 moves by adding 1 cube 3 times and removing 1 cube 2 times. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print "No" because `5 % 2 != 3 % 2`.

To fix this, the program should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, as the number of additions and removals must balance out to achieve the desired number of cubes. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
