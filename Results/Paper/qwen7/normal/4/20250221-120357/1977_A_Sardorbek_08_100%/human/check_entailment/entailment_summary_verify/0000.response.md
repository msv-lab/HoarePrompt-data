### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes exactly one cube.
   - The key observation is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves (`n`) and the desired number of cubes (`m`) must match for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes pairs of integers `(n, m)` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions.
   - The conditions provided in the original assessment are incorrect.

3. **Original Program Analysis**:
   - The program checks several conditions but does not correctly determine the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Specifically, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is incorrect because it checks the parity of the sum of `b` and `c`, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The correct condition should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, i.e., `(b - c) % 2 == 0`.

4. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected version of the program checks if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The original program did not correctly determine the possibility of achieving the desired number of cubes, and the provided corrected version fixes this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
