Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains logical errors in its conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition `if b == c:`**: This condition correctly identifies when the number of moves `b` equals the number of cubes `c`, which means it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, this should print "Yes" (uppercase).

2. **Condition `elif b < c:`**: This condition incorrectly handles the case where `b` (number of moves) is less than `c` (number of cubes). It should always print "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes than moves.

3. **Condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`**: This condition checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of `b` and `c` are the same. This is a crucial part of the solution. If the parities match, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the condition should print "Yes" (uppercase) if true.

4. **Else block**: This block incorrectly prints "No" without checking the parity condition properly.

Given these points, the program needs to correctly handle the conditions to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct implementation should be:

- If `b == c`, print "Yes".
- If `b < c`, print "No".
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

The provided code does not fully meet these criteria, particularly in the handling of the parity check and the printing of "Yes" or "No" in the correct format.

Correctness: **False**
