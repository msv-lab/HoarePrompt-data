You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the original value of `a` (which was at least 1), and `q` will be a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` from the last iteration of the loop. The values of `b` and `c` will be the integers provided as input in the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves:
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES' because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means he can just add cubes without removing any.
     - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is intended to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes. However, this condition alone is not sufficient.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Condition `b == c`:**
  - This is correct; if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add cubes without removing any, hence it's possible.

- **Condition `b < c`:**
  - This is correct; if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

- **Condition `b % 2 == c % 2`:**
  - This condition is necessary but not sufficient. The key point here is whether the number of additions and removals can balance to result in `c` cubes. 
  - For example, if `b` is even and `c` is odd, it's impossible to achieve `c` cubes because every move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity must match.

- **Else Condition:**
  - This condition should handle the remaining cases where `b % 2 != c % 2`. Given the above analysis, this condition should always be 'No' if the other conditions do not match.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the logic, we need to ensure that the parity condition is handled properly and all other conditions are checked correctly.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the `else` condition. The correct condition should be `print('NO')` instead of `print('Yes')`.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
