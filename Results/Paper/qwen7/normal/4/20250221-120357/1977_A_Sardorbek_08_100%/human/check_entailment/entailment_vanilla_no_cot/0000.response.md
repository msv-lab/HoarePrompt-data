Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Case where `b` (number of moves) is greater than `c` (number of cubes):**
   - The program checks if `b == c` and prints 'YES' if true.
   - It then incorrectly checks if `b < c` and prints 'NO'.
   - It should also check if `b >= c` and ensure that the difference between `b` and `c` is even because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes.

2. **Case where `b` and `c` have the same parity:**
   - The program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` and prints 'Yes' if true.
   - This condition alone is not sufficient; it should also check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the difference between the number of moves (`b`) and the number of cubes (`c`) is even, which is necessary and sufficient for the tower to have exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.
