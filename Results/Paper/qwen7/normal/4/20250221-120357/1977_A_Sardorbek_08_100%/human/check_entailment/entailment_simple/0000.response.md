Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.
4. The logic inside the loop checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'.
5. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
6. If `b` is not less than `c`, it further checks if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is an issue with the condition `if b % 2 == c % 2:`. This condition should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if both numbers have the same parity. The current condition `if b % 2 == c % 2:` is redundant and does not affect the logic but is incorrectly placed.

Given the problem statement and the logic, the code should correctly determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The current implementation, despite the redundant condition, still works correctly due to the correct placement of other conditions.

Correctness: **True**
