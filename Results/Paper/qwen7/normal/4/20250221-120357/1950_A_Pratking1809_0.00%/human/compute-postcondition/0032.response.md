Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is the total number of inputs provided by the user, which is at least 3 since the loop executed 3 times, `i` is now equal to `q-1` (the total number of iterations minus one), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` could be anything as long as they satisfy the input conditions for each iteration, but specifically for the last iteration, they remain unchanged from their initial values entered by the user.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` stays within the range of 1 to 1000, `q` is the total number of lines of input provided, `i` is the total number of iterations minus one, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the values entered during the last iteration of the loop.
