Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, where if `a < b < c` holds true, no changes are made to these variables. If the condition `a < b < c` does not hold, the variables remain as initially entered by the user.
