Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
- The condition `a >= b` or `b <= c` holds.

The print statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NONE'` without any variables or conditions affecting it. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
