Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is the total number of inputs provided by the user, `i` is equal to `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers entered by the user, and the output consists of `q` lines each indicating whether the input triplet forms a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions given.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 1000, `q` is the total number of times the loop ran, which is determined by the user's input, `i` will be equal to `q` because the loop increments `i` for each iteration, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values of the last set of integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The output will consist of `q` lines, each line indicating whether the corresponding triplet `(a, b, c)` forms a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
