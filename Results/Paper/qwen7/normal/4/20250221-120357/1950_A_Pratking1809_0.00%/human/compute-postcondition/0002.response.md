Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `mn` is 100 (this variable is not involved in the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < q`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `q` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `q` is at least 1 for the loop to start executing.
   - The value of `i` will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `q` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
