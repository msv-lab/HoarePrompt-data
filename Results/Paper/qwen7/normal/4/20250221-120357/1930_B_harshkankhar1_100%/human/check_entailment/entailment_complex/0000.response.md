Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided code defines a function `func_1()` which generates a permutation by creating a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \), then reversing every second element in this list.
3. Let's analyze the generated permutations:
   - For \( n = 4 \): The list becomes `[1, 4, 3, 2]`. This is a valid permutation because no pair of elements satisfies the division condition mentioned in the problem statement.
   - For \( n = 3 \): The list becomes `[1, 2, 3]`. This is also a valid permutation for the same reason.
4. The function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to generate such permutations for any given \( n \). It ensures that no two elements in the sequence violate the given condition by reversing every second element, which disrupts any potential divisibility pattern.

Given the analysis, the provided solution meets the requirements of the problem.
