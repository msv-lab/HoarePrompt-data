Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to the value of `n`, which is read from input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the range of `n` also remains the same as the precondition. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `a`.
