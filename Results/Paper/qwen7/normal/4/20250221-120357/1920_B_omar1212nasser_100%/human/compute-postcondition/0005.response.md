Output State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (since `-i` when `i` is 1 refers to the last element) from `s`. The value of `i` remains 1, and the condition that `removals` must be greater than 0 is still valid. Therefore, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-1]`.
