Output State: **`pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * s2`, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to `s2`. The other variables (`pos`, `removals`, and `negatives`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `pos` is now `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`.
