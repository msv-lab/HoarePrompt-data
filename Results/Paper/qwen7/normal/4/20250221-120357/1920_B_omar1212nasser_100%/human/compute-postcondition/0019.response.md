Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variables `i` and `removals`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   The loop condition is `for i in range(1, removals + 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `removals + 1`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `removals` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`
   - `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`
   - `negatives + 3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`
   - `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2, s - 2 * s2]`
   - If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value.

4. **Update the Values for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `removals + 1`.
   - Therefore, `removals` must be at least 3 (since `i` starts from 1).

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `removals` must remain greater than 0 and now specifically must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `removals` must be at least 3**
