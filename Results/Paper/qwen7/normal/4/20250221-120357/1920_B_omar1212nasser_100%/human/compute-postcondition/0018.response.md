Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`, `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2, s - 2 * s2]`, and if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `pos.append(s - 2 * s2)` appends the value of `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos`. Since `pos` was previously `[s - 2 * s2]`, after appending, `pos` becomes `[s - 2 * s2, s - 2 * s2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
