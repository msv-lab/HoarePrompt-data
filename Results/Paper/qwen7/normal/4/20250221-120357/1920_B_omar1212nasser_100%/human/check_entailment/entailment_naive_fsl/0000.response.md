Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2 2
1 2 3 4
```

According to the problem description:
- Alice can remove at most 2 elements.
- Bob can multiply at most 2 elements by -1.

The optimal strategy would be:
1. Alice removes the smallest elements (1 and 2).
2. Bob multiplies the remaining elements (3 and 4) by -1.

After Alice's move, the array becomes `[3, 4]`. After Bob's move, the array becomes `[-3, -4]`, and the sum is `-7`.

However, the program calculates the maximum possible sum as follows:
- It sorts the array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- It considers different scenarios of removals and multiplications, but it does not always choose the optimal combination of moves.

For instance, in the given example, the program might incorrectly calculate the sum without considering the optimal sequence of moves. This leads to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
