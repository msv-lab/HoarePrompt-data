Output State: `i` is equal to `removals + 1`, `removals` must be greater than or equal to `removals`, `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `s2` is `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` contains `removals` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, and `s2` is adjusted by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` for each iteration where `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `removals + 1`, `s` will be the initial `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `s2` will be the initial `s2` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `negatives + removals` will be less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` will contain `removals` values, each calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.
