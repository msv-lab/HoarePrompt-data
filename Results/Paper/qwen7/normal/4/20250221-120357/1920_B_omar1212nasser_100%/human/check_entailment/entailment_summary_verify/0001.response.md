### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the function `func_2` against the problem description and the test cases.

#### Re-evaluation of `func_2`:

1. **Initialization and Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The function starts by calculating the initial sum `s` of the array `elements`.
   - It then appends the sum after removing the last `negatives` elements without negating them to `pos`.

2. **Iterative Update**:
   - The function iterates from 1 to `removals`:
     - In each iteration, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the current largest element.
     - It updates `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements) similarly.
     - If there are enough remaining elements to consider negations, it adjusts `s2` by adding the next largest element.
     - It appends the new sum to `pos`.

3. **Handling Removals and Negations**:
   - The function considers all possible combinations of removals and negations to find the maximum sum.
   - However, the logic for handling the removals and negations might not be fully optimal.

#### Test Case Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Alice removes the only element, resulting in an empty array. Sum is 0.
   - Correct.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4 1 1 3 1 2 4`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Alice doesn't remove any elements. Bob negates the largest element (4). Sum is `3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2`.
   - Correct.

3. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `6 6 3 1 4 3 2 5 6`
   - Output: `-5`
   - Explanation: Alice removes all elements. Bob negates the three largest elements (6, 5, 4). Sum is `-5 - 3 - 2 = -10`. However, the expected output is `-5`, which suggests a mistake in the logic.
   - The function should consider the optimal strategy where Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the largest elements. The current logic does not account for this correctly.

4. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `6 6 1 3 7 3 3 32 15`
   - Output: `-9`
   - Explanation: Alice removes all elements. Bob negates the largest element (32). Sum is `-32 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 15 = -9`.
   - Correct.

5. **Test Case 8**:
   - Input: `2 2 1 4 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Alice removes the two smallest elements (3, 4). Bob negates the largest element (3). Sum is `-3 - 3 + 4 = -2`. However, the expected output is `0`, indicating a mistake.
   - The function should consider the optimal strategy where Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the largest elements. The current logic does not account for this correctly.

### Conclusion:

Upon re-evaluating the logic and test cases, it is clear that the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The logic for updating `s2` and handling the removals and negations needs to be more carefully considered to ensure the optimal solution is found.

**Final: False**

The provided program is not fully correct based on the given problem description and test cases.
