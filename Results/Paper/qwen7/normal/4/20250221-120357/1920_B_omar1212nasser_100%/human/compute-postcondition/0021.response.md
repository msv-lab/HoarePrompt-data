Output State: **`i` is 3; `removals` must be at least 3; `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`; `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-3]`**

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the value of `elements[-i]` from `s2`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `s2` is decreased by `elements[-3]`. The values of `i`, `removals`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `s` is already adjusted by `elements[-3]` in a previous operation.
