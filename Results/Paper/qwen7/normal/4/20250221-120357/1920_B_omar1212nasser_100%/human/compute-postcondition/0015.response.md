Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`, `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2], `s2` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `s2` by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2 and `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, the index `-(negatives + i)` will be a valid index within the list `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
