Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It returns the maximum value among the `removals` elements in `pos`, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.**

Here, `pos` is derived from the `elements` list after performing up to `removals` removals and up to `negatives` multiplications by -1 on elements of the list.
