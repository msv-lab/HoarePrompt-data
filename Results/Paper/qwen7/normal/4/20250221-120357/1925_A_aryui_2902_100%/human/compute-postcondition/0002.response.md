Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of the first k characters of 's' repeated n times.**

Given that `s` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, the program will return a string that starts from the beginning of `s` and includes the first `k` characters of it, repeated `n` times. For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 3, the program would return `'abcdeabcdeabcde'`.
