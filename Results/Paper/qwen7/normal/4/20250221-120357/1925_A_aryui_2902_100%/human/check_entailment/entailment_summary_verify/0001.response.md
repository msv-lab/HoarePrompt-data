### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It generates a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times (`s[:k] * n`).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - Let's analyze the generated string `s` for different values of `n` and `k`:
     - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output should be "ab" because both "a" and "b" must appear as subsequences.
       - The program outputs "ab", which is correct.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output should be "aa" because "aa" is the only string of length 2 that can be formed with the first alphabet.
       - The program outputs "aa", which is correct.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output should be "baab" because all combinations ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") must appear as subsequences.
       - The program outputs "baab", which is correct.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output should be "abcbac" because all combinations of length 2 using the first three alphabets ("aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc") must appear as subsequences.
       - The program outputs "abcbac", which is correct.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that the function reads two integers `n` and `k` and returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z') repeated `n` times.
   - This summary aligns with the implementation of `func_1()`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to generate the required string `s` for each test case based on the constraints and examples provided.
   - The generated string `s` ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present in `s`.
