Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. The values of `i`, `n`, `p[b]`, `s`, `bm`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states except for the updates to `sm`.
