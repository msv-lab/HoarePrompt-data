Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`; `sp` is updated to `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
