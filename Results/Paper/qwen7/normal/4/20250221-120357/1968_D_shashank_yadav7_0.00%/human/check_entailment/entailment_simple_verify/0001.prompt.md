You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be less than `n`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variable `k` will be -1, as it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0 and the loop breaks. The variables `b` and `s` will be updated multiple times based on the list `p`, with `b` being updated `n` times and `s` being updated `n-1` times. 
    #
    #The variable `bm` will be the final sum of `bm` and the maximum values calculated during each iteration, considering the updated positions of `b` and `s`. Similarly, `sm` will be the sum of `sm` and the maximum values calculated during each iteration, also considering the updated positions of `b` and `s`. Both `sp` and `bp` will be incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, after each update of `b` and `s`.
    #
    #The final output will be determined by comparing `bm` and `sm`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the output will be 'Bodya'. If `sm` is greater than `bm`, the output will be 'Sasha'. If `bm` equals `sm`, the output will be 'Draw'.
    #
    #In summary, the output state will reflect the final values of `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, `s`, `k`, and `i` after the loop completes, along with the final output string based on the comparison between `bm` and `sm`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` which represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `bm` (Bodya's maximum possible score) and `sm` (Sasha's maximum possible score) with the initial scores at their respective starting positions.
   - It then iterates up to `k` times to simulate the game. In each iteration:
     - It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
     - It calculates the potential scores for Bodya and Sasha if they stay at their current positions or move to the new positions.
     - It updates `bm` and `sm` with the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - After the loop, it compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initialization part correctly converts the starting positions from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - The initial scores are correctly set based on the starting positions.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The loop runs up to `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - For each turn, it correctly updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the potential scores for staying at the current position or moving to the new position.
   - It updates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha accordingly.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` correctly determines the winner or if it's a draw.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- The program handles the case where the game ends after `k` turns without needing to run the loop for all `n` elements.
- The use of `max` ensures that the maximum possible scores are considered for each turn.
- The program correctly accounts for the possibility of different strategies (staying or moving) at each turn.

### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the code.
