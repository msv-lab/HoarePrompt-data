Postcondition: `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is the sum of `bm` and the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * (-1) + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is the sum of `sm` and the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (-1) + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` equals `sm`.
