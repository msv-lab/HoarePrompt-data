Postcondition: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - n + 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - n`, `bm` is `n * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] * n + sp`, `bp` is `4 * a[b] * (n-1)`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the entire if-else block. It states that `k` remains `-1`, `b` and `s` are updated based on the number of iterations `n`, and the values of `bm` and `sm` are updated according to their respective expressions. The values of `sp` and `bp` are also updated as per the summation of their respective expressions over all iterations. The conditions involving `i`, `n`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged from the precondition.
