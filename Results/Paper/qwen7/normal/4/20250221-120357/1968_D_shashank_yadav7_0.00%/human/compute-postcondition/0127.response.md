Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 2] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**
