Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is explicitly given as -1.
- `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - n + 1`.
- `s` is defined as `p[p[s] - 1] - n`.
- `bm` is defined as `n * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` is defined as `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `sp` is defined as `a[s] * n + sp`.
- `bp` is defined as `4 * a[b] * (n-1)`.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
