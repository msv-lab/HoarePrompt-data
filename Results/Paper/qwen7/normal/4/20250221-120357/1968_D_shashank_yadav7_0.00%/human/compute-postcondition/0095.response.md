Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are updated according to the given expressions. The initial state of `i` being 2 and `k` being decreased by 1 remain unchanged, and `b` is set to `p[b] - 1`. After executing the line `s = p[s] - 1`, `s` is updated to the value of `p[s] - 1`.
