Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. It initializes the necessary variables for each test case.
3. The logic for updating the positions `b` and `s` using the permutation `p` is correct.
4. The scores `bm` and `sm` are calculated correctly by considering the maximum possible scores at each step.
5. The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner is accurate.
6. The function handles all the required operations within the constraints provided.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
