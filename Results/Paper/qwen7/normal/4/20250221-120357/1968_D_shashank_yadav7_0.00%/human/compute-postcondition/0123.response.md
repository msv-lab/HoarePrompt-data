Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 2] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the sum of `sm` and the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (-1) + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is now `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `sp` is updated to `a[s]`.**

Explanation:
- `bm` is updated to `a[b] * k`. Given that `k` is -1, `bm` becomes `a[b] * -1` or `-a[b]`.
- The values of `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `n`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states because no other operations are performed on them.
- The conditions for `bm` and `sm` (whether `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm`) also remain the same.
