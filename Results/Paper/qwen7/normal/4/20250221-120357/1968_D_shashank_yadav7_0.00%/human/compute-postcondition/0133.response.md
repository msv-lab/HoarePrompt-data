Output State: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, `b` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates the value of `bm`. Here, `k` is 0, so `a[b] * k` is 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `max(bm, a[b] * 0 + bp)`, which is just `max(bm, bp)`. This means `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `bp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
