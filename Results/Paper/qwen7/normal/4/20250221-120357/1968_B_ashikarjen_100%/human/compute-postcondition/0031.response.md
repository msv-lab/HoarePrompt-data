Output State: **`j` is greater than or equal to `m` + 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is 1, `i` is `m + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it `j` is greater than or equal to `m` + 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
