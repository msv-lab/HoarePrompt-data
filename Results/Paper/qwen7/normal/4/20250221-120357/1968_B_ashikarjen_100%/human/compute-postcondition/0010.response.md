Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that both parts of the condition are true for the loop to continue executing.

   - The first part of the condition is `j < m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - The second part of the condition is `b[j] != a[i]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - For `j < m` to be true, `m` must be greater than `j`. Since `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.
   - For `b[j] != a[i]` to be true, `b[2]` (since `j` is now 2) must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` (which is already set to 2), `m` (must be greater than 2), and `b[2]` (must not be equal to `a[i]`).

However, since `j` is already set to 2, we don't need to explicitly mention it. The key adjustments are on `m` and `b[2]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
