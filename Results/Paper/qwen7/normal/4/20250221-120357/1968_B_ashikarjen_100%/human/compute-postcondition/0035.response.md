Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `k` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is `m + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `m + 1` and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `m + 2`.

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
- `j` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `b` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is either 0 or 1.
- `i` is `m + 2`.

State: **`j` is greater than or equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `k` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `m + 2`**.
