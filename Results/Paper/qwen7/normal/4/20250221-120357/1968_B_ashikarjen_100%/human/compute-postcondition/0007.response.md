Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `b[0]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
