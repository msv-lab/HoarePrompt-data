Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is the total sum of the floor divisions of all elements in the original list `a` by 2, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

In simpler terms, after the loop has run through all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because it processes one element per iteration until there are no more elements left. The variable `cnt` will hold the cumulative sum of the floor division of each element in the original list `a` by 2. This means `cnt` starts at 0 and increases by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 during each iteration of the loop.
