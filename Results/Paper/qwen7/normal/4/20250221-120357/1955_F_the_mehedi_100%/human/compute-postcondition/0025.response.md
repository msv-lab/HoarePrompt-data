Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head is defined as `for x in a`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `x` is the second-to-last element of `a`.
   - `cnt` is 3.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must be the last element of `a` (since it was the second-to-last element in the previous iteration).
   - After processing the current element `x`, `x` will move to the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust States:**
   - `x` will now be the last element of `a`.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modifications are mentioned, it stays as 3.
   - `t` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modifications are mentioned, it stays as a positive integer within the given range.

### Final State:
- `a` will be modified to remove the last element (which was `x` in the previous iteration).
- `x` will be the last element of the updated list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list with its last element being the previous `x`, `x` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
