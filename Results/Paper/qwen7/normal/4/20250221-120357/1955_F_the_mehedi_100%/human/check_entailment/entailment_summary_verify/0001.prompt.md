You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the floor division of each count by 2 and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - A variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to count the number of times Bob can win.

3. **Win Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1`. This condition is used to determine if there is at least one odd count among the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
     - If this condition is true, it means that initially, the sequence has at least one 1, one 2, and one 3. In such a case, Alice would win because the XOR of these numbers (1, 2, 3) is non-zero. Therefore, Bob wins once.
     - If this condition is false, Bob wins zero times initially.

4. **Count Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates over the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - For each count `x`, it adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`. This part of the code does not seem to be relevant to the problem since the goal is to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

5. **Output:**
   - The final value of `cnt` is printed, which should represent the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically, the check `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` is not sufficient to determine the optimal strategy for Bob.
- The program incorrectly adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt` for each count, which is irrelevant to the problem.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not account for the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
