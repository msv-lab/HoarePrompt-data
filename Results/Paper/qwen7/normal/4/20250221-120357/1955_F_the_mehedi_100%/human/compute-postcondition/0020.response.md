Output State: **`a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `x` is the second-to-last element of `a`, `cnt` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
