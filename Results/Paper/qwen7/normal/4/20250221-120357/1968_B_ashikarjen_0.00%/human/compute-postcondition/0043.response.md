Output State: The final value of `j` will be equal to the original value of `j` plus the total number of iterations plus 1, and `j` will be less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, for each iteration, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will have been incremented by the total number of iterations plus one, and it will either be equal to `m` (if the condition `j < m` was no longer satisfied) or it will be the last index where `b[j]` was not equal to `a[i]` before the condition `j < m` became false.
