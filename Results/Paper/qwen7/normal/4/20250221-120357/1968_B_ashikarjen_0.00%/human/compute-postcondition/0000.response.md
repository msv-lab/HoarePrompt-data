Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is the first integer entered, m is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts, and then converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t` and `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
