Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is 0, and for every index `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it is still less than `m`. Additionally, after all iterations, `b[j]` will not be equal to `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is equal to the original value of `j` plus the total number of iterations plus 1, and `j` is less than `m`. During each iteration, the condition `b[j] != a[i]` must hold true. If `j` reaches or exceeds `m` before the loop completes, the loop breaks out.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
