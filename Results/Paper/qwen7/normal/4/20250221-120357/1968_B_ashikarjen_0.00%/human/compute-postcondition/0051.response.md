Output State: **`j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it is still less than `m`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped, and for every index `i` from 0 to `j-1`, `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]` if `j` did not reach `m` during the loop's execution.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `j` will have reached the last index where `a[i]` matched `b[j]` (or the end of `b` if no more matches were found), `k` will count the number of such matches, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) will retain their respective values from the initial state unless they were modified within the loop, which they were not.
