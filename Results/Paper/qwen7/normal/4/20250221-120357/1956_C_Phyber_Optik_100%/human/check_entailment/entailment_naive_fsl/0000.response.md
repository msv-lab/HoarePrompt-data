Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. According to the problem description, the goal is to fill the matrix with values such that the sum is maximized using no more than 2n operations. The program calculates a sum using a formula which is not relevant to the problem and prints a fixed number of operations without actually performing the required permutations.

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

- For \( n = 1 \), the correct output should be:
  ```
  1 1
  1 1 1
  ```

- For \( n = 2 \), the correct output should involve setting the matrix elements to achieve the maximum possible sum, which is 7, using three operations as described in the example.

However, the provided program does not perform any actual operations to set the matrix elements. Instead, it calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the problem and prints a fixed number of operations, which is not valid according to the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
