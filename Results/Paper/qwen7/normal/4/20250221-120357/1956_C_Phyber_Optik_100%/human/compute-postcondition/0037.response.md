State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240**

### Explanation:
1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
4. **Given Information**: The final state of `sum` is 9240, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
5. **Adjust State**: To ensure the loop can execute and reach the final state of `sum` being 9240, we need to set `j` to its initial value (1) and ensure `n` meets the condition for the loop to run sufficiently to achieve the given `sum`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be:
- `j` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
- `sum` is 9240
