Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
   - `sum` is 9240

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n + 1`. Given that `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

5. **Update the state**: The `sum` variable is not part of the loop head and does not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, it remains unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240**
