Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. This means the loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j = 2`.
   - The condition `j < n` must still hold true, meaning `n` must remain a positive integer greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` needs to be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0**
