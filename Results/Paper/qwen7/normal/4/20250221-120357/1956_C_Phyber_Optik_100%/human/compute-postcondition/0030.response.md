Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `sum` is 2 * (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = 6

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, let's assume `n` is at least 3 (since `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue).

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be at least 5.

7. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

8. **Sum Value:**
   - The value of `sum` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here. Therefore, `sum` remains 6.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
- `sum` is 6

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 6**
