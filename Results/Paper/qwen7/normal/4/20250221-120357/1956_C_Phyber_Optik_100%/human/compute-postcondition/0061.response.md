Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `j` is 1, and `n` must be a positive integer.
2. The `print` statement is: `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break down the components of the `print` statement:

- `1`: This is explicitly given as 1.
- `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1` which is simply `n`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` into individual arguments for the `print` function.

So, the `print` statement effectively becomes:
```
print(1, n, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- The number 1.
- The value of `n`.
- All integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 n 1 2 ... n (where n is the positive integer value)**
