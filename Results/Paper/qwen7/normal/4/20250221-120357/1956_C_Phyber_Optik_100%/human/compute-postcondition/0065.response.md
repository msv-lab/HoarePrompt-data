Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.

Let's break down the `print` statement step by step:

1. **First argument**: `2` is directly printed as it is a constant.
2. **Second argument**: `n - j + 1`. Given `j = 2`, this becomes `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`. This value depends on the value of `n`.
3. **Third argument**: `*range(1, n + 1)`. This unpacks the range object into individual elements. The range starts from 1 and goes up to `n` inclusive.

Putting it all together, the `print` statement will output:

- The number `2`
- The value of `n - 1`
- All integers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2, [n - 1], 1 2 ... n (where [n - 1] is the value of n - 1 and 1 2 ... n are the integers from 1 to n)**
