Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or the columns.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates a sum using a loop, which seems unrelated to the problem's requirements.
   - The sum calculated (`sum`) is not used in the final output.
   - The function prints `n + n` as the number of operations, which is not correct because the operations should be defined as per the problem statement.
   - The operations printed do not follow the correct format. Specifically, they should involve permuting rows or columns as described in the problem, but the current implementation just prints a sequence of numbers without specifying the actual permutations.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
