State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, _ is not a variable and does not need adjustment**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when you don't need to use the index or value inside the loop. It does not require any specific state adjustment.
- The variable `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head, and its value determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
