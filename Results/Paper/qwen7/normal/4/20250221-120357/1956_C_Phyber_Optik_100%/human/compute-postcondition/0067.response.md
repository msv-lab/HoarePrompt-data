Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.

Let's break down the `print` statement:

1. The first argument is `1`.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
3. The third argument uses the `*range(1, n + 1)` which unpacks a range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

So, the `print` statement will output three parts:

- The number `1`.
- The value of `n - 2`.
- All integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given these details, the output will be:

Output: **1, n - 2, 1 2 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
