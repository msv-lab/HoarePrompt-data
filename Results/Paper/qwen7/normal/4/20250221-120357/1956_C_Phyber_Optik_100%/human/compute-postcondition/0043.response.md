Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
   - `sum` is 9240

4. **Determine the new value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: For the loop to continue executing, `j` must still be less than `n + 1`. Given that `j` is now 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. However, since `n` must already be greater than or equal to 5 (as per the initial condition), this condition remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we need to update these values. The `sum` variable is not part of the loop head, so its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240**
