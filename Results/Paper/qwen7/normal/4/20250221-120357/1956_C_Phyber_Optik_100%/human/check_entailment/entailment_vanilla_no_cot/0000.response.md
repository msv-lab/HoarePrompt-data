Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it attempts to calculate a sum based on a formula that does not relate to the operations described in the problem. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through specific operations (Type 1 and Type 2), whereas the program tries to compute a sum using a different mathematical approach.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should perform the required operations to fill the matrix with the sequence of numbers from 1 to \(n^2\) in such a way that the sum is maximized. The provided solution does not achieve this.
