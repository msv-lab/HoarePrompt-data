Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n`: This is the upper limit of the range function.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `sum` is initially 1.
   - `j` is initially `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will start with `i` equal to 2 and continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` equal to 2, `i` must be set to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute (since `i` starts from 2).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`sum` is 1, `j` is `n+1`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
