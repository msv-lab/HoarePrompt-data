Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 2 to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at 2 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` as 2, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 2.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`). Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Other variables**: The variable `t` is not involved in the loop itself, so its current state (`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0) does not affect the loop's execution. Similarly, the variable `sum` being 1 is not relevant to the loop's execution either.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
