Output State: The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the input integer. For each iteration, `j` will range from 1 to `n`, and the loop will print two lines for each value of `j`. After all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1` for each of the `t` iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` since it is incremented up to `n` in the inner loop but not reset, and `sum` will be the sum calculated for the last value of `n`. The variable `n` will remain the same as the input for each iteration.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop will run `t` times, with `j` ranging from 1 to `n` for each iteration. After all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, `i` will be `n + 1`, `sum` will be the final sum calculated for the last value of `n`, and `n` will be the original input integer.
