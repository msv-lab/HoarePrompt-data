You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k, a, b)

def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff` is a list representing the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The function then prints and returns this minimum value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to help Kirill minimize the cost to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
   - For each position `i`, we can calculate the cost to move from any position `j` (where `j < i`) to `i` using `a[j]` and `b[k]` for all `k` where `j < k < i`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The cost to move from position `j` to position `i` is `a[j]` initially and then `b[k]` for all `k` between `j` and `i-1`.
   - To minimize the total cost, we can precompute the minimum cost to reach each position `i` from any position `j < i`.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes the array `c` which stores the minimum cost to move to position `i` directly from `i` (either `a[i]` or `b[i]`).
   - It then computes the suffix sum array `suff` which helps in efficiently calculating the cumulative cost from position `i+1` to the end.
   - Finally, it iterates through the first `m` positions to find the minimum cost to move to any of these positions.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for computing the minimum cost is sound.
   - The use of suffix sums allows efficient computation of the total cost when moving from any position `j` to `i`.
   - The iteration through the first `m` positions ensures that the minimum cost is found.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
