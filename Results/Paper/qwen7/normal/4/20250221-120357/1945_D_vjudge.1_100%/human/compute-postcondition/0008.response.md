Output State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, and `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the end of the loop, `suff[0]` accumulates the sum of all elements in `c` because `suff[n]` (which is `0` initially) is added to `c[n-1]`, then `c[n-2]`, and so on, until `c[0]` is added.
