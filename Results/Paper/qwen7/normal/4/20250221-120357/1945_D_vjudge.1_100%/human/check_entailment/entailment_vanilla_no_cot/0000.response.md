Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`n`) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`k`).
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` which contain the costs associated with moving past each person.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - A new array `c` is created where each element `c[i]` is the minimum cost of moving past the `i-th` person, either by paying `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
   - A suffix sum array `suff` is computed, where `suff[i]` represents the total cost of moving past all people from index `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the first `k` positions and calculates the total cost of moving Kirill to each of these positions.
   - The minimum cost among these positions is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The minimum cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that Kirill finds the optimal position within the first `m` people while minimizing the cost. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
