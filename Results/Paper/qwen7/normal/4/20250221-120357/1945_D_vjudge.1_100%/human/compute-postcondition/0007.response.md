Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is `n - 3`. The code updates `suff[i]` to be `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, `i + 1` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `suff[i]` is now `suff[n - 2] + c[n - 3]`, which is the same as the initial value of `suff[i]`. Hence, the value of `suff[i]` remains unchanged, and the only change is the updated expression for `suff[i]`.
