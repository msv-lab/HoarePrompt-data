### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to help Kirill minimize the cost to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
   - For each position `i`, we can calculate the cost to move from any position `j` (where `j < i`) to `i` using `a[j]` and `b[k]` for all `k` where `j < k < i`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The cost to move from position `j` to position `i` is `a[j]` initially and then `b[k]` for all `k` between `j` and `i-1`.
   - To minimize the total cost, we can precompute the minimum cost to reach each position `i` from any position `j < i`.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes the array `c` which stores the minimum cost to move to position `i` directly from `i` (either `a[i]` or `b[i]`).
   - It then computes the suffix sum array `suff` which helps in efficiently calculating the cumulative cost from position `i+1` to the end.
   - Finally, it iterates through the first `m` positions to find the minimum cost to move to any of these positions.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for computing the minimum cost is sound.
   - The use of suffix sums allows efficient computation of the total cost when moving from any position `j` to `i`.
   - The iteration through the first `m` positions ensures that the minimum cost is found.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic used in the code. Specifically, the code assumes that the minimum cost to move to position `i` is either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, but it does not consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions. The suffix sum array `suff` is used to compute the cumulative cost from position `i+1` to the end, but it does not account for the intermediate costs correctly.

Let's break down the issue:

- The array `c` is initialized to store the minimum cost to move to position `i` directly from `i` (either `a[i]` or `b[i]`). This part is correct.
- The suffix sum array `suff` is computed correctly, but it only accounts for the cumulative cost from position `i+1` to the end, without considering the intermediate costs.
- The final loop iterates through the first `m` positions to find the minimum cost, but it does not correctly account for the cumulative intermediate costs.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the suffix sum array `suff` includes the cumulative intermediate costs. Specifically, we need to update the suffix sum array to include the cumulative cost of moving through all intermediate positions.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
    
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        temp_cost = a[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, k):
            temp_cost += b[j - 1]
        ans = min(ans, temp_cost + suff[i + 1])
    
    print(ans)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original code did not correctly account for the cumulative intermediate costs. The corrected code ensures that the cumulative intermediate costs are included in the calculation. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: False**
