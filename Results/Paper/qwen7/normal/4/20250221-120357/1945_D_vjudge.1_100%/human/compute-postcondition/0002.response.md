Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being `n - 1` and decrements until `i` reaches `-1`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be `n - 1`.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`. If `n` were 0, the loop would not execute.

4. **Adjust the other states**: The other states (`c`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `suff`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's execution conditions.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
