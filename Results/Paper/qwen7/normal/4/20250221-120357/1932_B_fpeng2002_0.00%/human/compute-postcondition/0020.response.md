Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `x`: The loop variable.
   - `len(nums)`: The length of the `nums` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` starts at 0.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `x < len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` should be set to 0 because it starts the loop at 0.
   - `len(nums)` should reflect the actual length of the `nums` list.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, but this is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `start_year` is 0, but this is also not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input, and its length must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `len(nums)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, and `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input that must have at least 1 element**.
