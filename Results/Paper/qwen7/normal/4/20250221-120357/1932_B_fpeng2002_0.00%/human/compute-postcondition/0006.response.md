Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The objects involved here are `x`, `len(nums)`, and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x`: This variable will take values from `0` to `len(nums) - 1` during the loop iterations.
   - `len(nums)`: This is the length of the `nums` list.
   - `nums`: This is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 1 because the range function starts from `0` and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - The value of `x` will start from `0` and increment by `1` until it reaches `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Consider the given initial states**:
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` is an input integer: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `start_year` is `0`: This is not directly related to the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `x` will start from `0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`nums` must have at least one element, `x` is 0**
