Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided function to determine if it correctly computes the year when the nth sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a_i`).
3. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to keep track of the current year as the function processes each sign.
4. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates over the list of periodicities (`nums`). In each iteration, it updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `nums[x]` after accounting for the previous sign's occurrence.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in the loop:
- The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is not correct for finding the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`. Instead, it should simply be `((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]`.

To fix this, we need to adjust the formula to correctly compute the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

Here is the corrected version of the loop logic:
```python
for x in range(len(nums)):
    start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]
```

Given this analysis, the original function does not correctly compute the desired result due to the incorrect formula used in the loop. Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
