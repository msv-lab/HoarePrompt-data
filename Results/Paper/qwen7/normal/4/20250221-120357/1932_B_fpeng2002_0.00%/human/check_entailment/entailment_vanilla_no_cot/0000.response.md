Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the year when all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the loop where `start_year` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly compute the next year when the current sign will occur after the previous one.

To fix this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, as the LCM will give us the first year when all signs will occur together. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        current_lcm = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            current_lcm = lcm(current_lcm, nums[i])
        print(current_lcm)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the least common multiple of the periodicities, which gives the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
