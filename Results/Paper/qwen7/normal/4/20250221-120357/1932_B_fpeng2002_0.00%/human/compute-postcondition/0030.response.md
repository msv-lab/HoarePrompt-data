Output State: **`x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`, `start_year` is `((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])`, and `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `num_tests` is decremented by 1. The values of `x` and `start_year` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `x` is still equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`, and `start_year` is still calculated as `((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])`. The only change is that `num_tests` is now one less than its original value.
