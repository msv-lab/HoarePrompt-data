Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; n is an input integer.**

This output state reflects that the variable `num_tests` has been decremented by 1 due to the execution of the input operation, while other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
