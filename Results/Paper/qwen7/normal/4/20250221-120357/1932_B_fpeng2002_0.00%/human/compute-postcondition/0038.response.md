Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `x` is 1
- `start_year` is `(((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `x`**: The loop variable `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `x` should be 2.
2. **Variable `start_year`**: The value of `start_year` is determined by the expression `(((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`. This expression does not depend on `x`, so it remains unchanged for the next iteration.

### Conclusion
The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is `x`.

### Updated State
State: **`x` is 2; `start_year` is `(((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`**
