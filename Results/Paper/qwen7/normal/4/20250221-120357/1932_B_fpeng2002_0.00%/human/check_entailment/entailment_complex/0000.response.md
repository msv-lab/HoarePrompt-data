Reasoning:
The annotated program does not accurately describe the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to update `start_year` is incorrect. The intended logic should involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to determine when all signs will occur sequentially. However, the current implementation uses a different approach that does not correctly compute the LCM.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:
1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign, update `start_year` to the next occurrence of that sign after the previous sign has occurred. This can be done using the LCM of the current `start_year` and the current sign's periodicity.

The provided code uses a formula that does not correctly compute the LCM. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity after the current `start_year`, but it does not account for the sequential nature of the signs.

Given the problem description and the need to find the LCM, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
