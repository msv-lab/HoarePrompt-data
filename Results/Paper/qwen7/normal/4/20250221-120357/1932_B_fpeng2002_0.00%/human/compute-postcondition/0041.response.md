Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list; `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]) + 1) // nums[-1] + 1) * nums[-1].

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list because the loop runs from 0 to len(nums) - 1. The final value of `start_year` will be calculated by applying the loop's operation to the last element of `nums`. Specifically, it starts with the value of `start_year` after the third iteration and continues the operation for each subsequent element of `nums`, ending with the last element.
