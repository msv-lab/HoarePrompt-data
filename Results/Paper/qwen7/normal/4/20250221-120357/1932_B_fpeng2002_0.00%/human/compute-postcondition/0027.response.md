Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`, and `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]).

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop operation. The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list, updating the `start_year` variable based on the current value of `start_year` and the current element in the `nums` list. After each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, eventually reaching the length of the `nums` list.

Starting with `start_year` as 0, the loop updates `start_year` as follows:
1. First iteration: `start_year` becomes (((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0])
2. Second iteration: `start_year` becomes ((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])
3. Third iteration: `start_year` becomes ((((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2])

This pattern continues until the loop has executed `len(nums)` times, at which point `x` will be equal to `len(nums)` and `start_year` will be the final value calculated through the series of operations described above.
