Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will be updated to the next occurrence year for each sign.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates over each sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]`: This gives the quotient when `(start_year + 1)` is divided by `nums[x]`.
     - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures we get the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence year.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs, the final `start_year` is printed.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- `n = 6`
- Periodicities: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`

1. Start with `start_year = 0`.
2. First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
3. Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
4. Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
5. Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
6. Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
7. Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.

The final `start_year` is 36, which matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 2:
- `n = 5`
- Periodicities: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

1. Start with `start_year = 0`.
2. First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
3. Second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`.
4. Third sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
5. Fourth sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
6. Fifth sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`.

The final `start_year` is 5, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
