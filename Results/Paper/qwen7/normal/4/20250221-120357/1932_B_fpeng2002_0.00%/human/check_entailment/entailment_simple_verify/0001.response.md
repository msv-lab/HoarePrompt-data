### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and verifies it through examples. However, let's re-examine the program and the logic to ensure there are no subtle issues or edge cases that might not have been considered.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is correct as the first sign would occur in the first year if it starts immediately.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The loop iterates over each sign and updates `start_year` using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that `start_year` is always the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final `start_year` is printed, which represents the year when the nth sign occurs.

### Detailed Verification:

Let's break down the formula step-by-step:

- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]`: This gives the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year + 1`.
- `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`: This gives the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year + 1`.

This logic ensures that the program correctly computes the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Edge Cases:

1. **Single Sign:**
   - If `n = 1`, the program should return `0` since the first sign occurs in the first year.
   - The program correctly handles this case because `start_year` is initialized to `0`.

2. **Multiple Signs with Small Periods:**
   - If all signs have small periods (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), the program correctly computes the LCM-like progression.

3. **Large Periods:**
   - If signs have large periods (e.g., `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`), the program correctly computes the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the program and the logic, we confirm that the program correctly implements the required functionality. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
