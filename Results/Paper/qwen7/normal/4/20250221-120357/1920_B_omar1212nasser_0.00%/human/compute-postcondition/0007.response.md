Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` should start from 1 and `removals` should be at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically, `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be initialized to 1.

**State:**
- `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 1

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
