Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5] + elements[-5] - elements[-6]`, `pos` is a list with two elements: `s - 2 * n` and `s - 2 * n`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 5, the expression becomes `n += elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5]`. This means `n` is now updated to its previous value plus `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
