The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), along with a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) in ascending order and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product based on the sorted list. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
