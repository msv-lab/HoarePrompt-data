Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`. Given that `i` was initially 1, it is now 2. So, `n` is updated to `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1] + elements[-1] - elements[-2]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
