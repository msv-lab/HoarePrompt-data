You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array elements.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers. Either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: `removals` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is determined by the loop), `i` will be the total number of iterations + 1, `s` will be `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in the list `elements`, `n` will be the difference between the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements and the sum of the last `removals` elements in the list `elements`, `pos` will be a list containing the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `removals` will be at least as large as the total number of elements removed, `i` will be one more than the total number of iterations, `s` will be the original sum of the elements minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, `n` will be calculated based on the last `negatives + removals` elements compared to the last `removals` elements, and `pos` will contain the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration of the loop.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array elements). It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
