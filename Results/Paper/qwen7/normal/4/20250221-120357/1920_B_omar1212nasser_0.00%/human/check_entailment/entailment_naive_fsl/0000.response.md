Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` has hardcoded logic for the case where `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns 0. This hardcoded condition is not general and does not cover all possible values of `removals` and `negatives`.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```

According to the problem description, Alice can remove up to 6 elements, and Bob can negate up to 3 elements. The optimal strategy would involve removing the smallest elements and negating the largest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly due to the hardcoded condition.

A correct approach would involve dynamically calculating the best strategy based on the values of `removals` and `negatives` rather than relying on hardcoded conditions.
