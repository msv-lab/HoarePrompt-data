Output State: `removals` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is `removals` + 2 since we start from 1 and go up to `removals`), `i` is `removals` + 2, `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`, `n` is the adjusted difference considering the last `negatives` elements and the removed elements, `pos` is a list containing `removals` + 1 elements, each being `s - 2 * n`.

To break it down:
- The variable `removals` will be used as the upper limit for the loop, so after all iterations, `removals` must be at least as large as the total number of iterations performed.
- The variable `i` will be `removals + 2` because the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments by 1 each time, so after `removals` iterations, `i` will be `removals + 2`.
- The variable `s` will be updated to subtract the value of the `i-th` last element in `elements` for each iteration, so after all iterations, `s` will be the original sum minus the sum of the last `removals` elements.
- The variable `n` will be adjusted based on the last `negatives` elements and the removed elements, potentially becoming 0 if an `IndexError` occurs due to the subtraction exceeding the list bounds.
- The list `pos` will contain `removals + 1` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * n`, reflecting the result of each iteration's calculation.
