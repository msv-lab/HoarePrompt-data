Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program does not change any additional variables. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
