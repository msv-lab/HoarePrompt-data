Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the input, but their specific values are not provided here.
