Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function does not return a single value but processes each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` according to their values and provides a result for each test case.
