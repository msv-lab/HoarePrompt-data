Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of ((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k), `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` is calculated as specified. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as specified, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
