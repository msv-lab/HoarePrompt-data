Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of ((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, which is calculated using the values of `b` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `k` is determined before the calculation of `ans`.
