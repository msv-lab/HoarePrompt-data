Output State: **t must be a positive integer, n is an input integer, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, k is the minimum value between b - a + 1 and n, ans is the integer value of \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), p2 is \((n - k) \times a\).**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be the initial number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the last set of input values provided. The variable `k` will hold the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n` for the last iteration. `ans` will be the result of the calculation \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\) based on the last values of `b` and `k`. Similarly, `p2` will be \((n - k) \times a\) based on the last values of `n` and `k`.
