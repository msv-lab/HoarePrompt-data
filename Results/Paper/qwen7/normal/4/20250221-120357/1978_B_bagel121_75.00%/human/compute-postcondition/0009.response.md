Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `a < b`.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans + p2)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **`k` Calculation:**
  - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
  - This means `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.

- **`ans` Calculation:**
  - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
  - Simplifying inside the formula:
    - `b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1`.
    - So, `ans = int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
  - This simplifies further to:
    - `ans = int((b - k/2 + 1/2) * k)`.
  - Since `k` is an integer, the expression inside the `int()` function is evaluated as an integer.

- **`p2` Calculation:**
  - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
  - This is a straightforward multiplication.

### Final Expression:
- The final expression to be printed is `ans + p2`.
- Substituting the expressions for `ans` and `p2`, we get:
  - `ans + p2 = int((b - k/2 + 1/2) * k) + (n - k) * a`.

### Output:
Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the result of the expression `int((b - k/2 + 1/2) * k) + (n - k) * a`.

Output: **int((b - k/2 + 1/2) * k) + (n - k) * a**
