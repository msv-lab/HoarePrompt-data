Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves `neighbor` and `current`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[current]`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - **`tree[current]`**: This list should contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - **`neighbor`**: This variable will take on each value from `tree[current]` in each iteration.
   - **`visited`**: If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, it will be added to `visited`.
   - **`queue`**: A tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` will be added to `queue` if `neighbor` is not already visited.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the key states to adjust are `tree[current]`, `neighbor`, `visited`, and `queue`.

Since we are starting a new iteration, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element (ensuring the loop can execute). `neighbor` will be set to the first element of `tree[current]` in the next iteration. `visited` and `queue` will be updated based on the value of `neighbor` but these updates are not directly reflected in the loop head.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `tree[current]` must contain at least one element.
- `neighbor` will be the first element of `tree[current]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the first element of `tree[current]`**.
