Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and `current` will be the next `neighbor` from the previous iteration's `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now contains `neighbor`, and `queue` contains a tuple of `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.
