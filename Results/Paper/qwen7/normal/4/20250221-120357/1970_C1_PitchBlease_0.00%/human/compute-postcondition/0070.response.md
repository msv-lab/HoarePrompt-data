Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, where `start` is an integer representing the starting node and `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 if the target is not found, the distance from the start node to the current node when dequeued from the queue, the distance which was the second element of the tuple dequeued from the queue, or -1 if an error occurs.**
