Output State: **The `queue` now contains all the elements it previously had except for the first tuple (which has been dequeued), `current` is the first element of the tuple that was dequeued, and `dist` is the second element of the same tuple. The `visited` set remains unchanged.**

This means that the `queue` has lost its first tuple, `current` now holds the first neighbor from that tuple, and `dist` holds the distance associated with that neighbor. The `visited` set, which tracks all nodes visited during the traversal, remains the same as before the operation.
