The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, the `queue` contains the tuple (`start`, 0). For the loop to execute the first time, the `queue` must contain at least one element.

Given that the `queue` currently contains the tuple (`start`, 0), it already has one element, which means the loop condition `queue` is satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the `queue`.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
