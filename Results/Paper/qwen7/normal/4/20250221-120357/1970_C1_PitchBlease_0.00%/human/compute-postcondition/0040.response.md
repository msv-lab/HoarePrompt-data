Output State: **`queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the next neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.**

The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that the `neighbor` is now included in the `visited` set, while the other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
