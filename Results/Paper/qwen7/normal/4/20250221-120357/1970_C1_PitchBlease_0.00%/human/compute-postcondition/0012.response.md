Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple that was second in the original queue, `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `neighbor`, and `current` has at least one unvisited neighbor.**

Explanation: The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the `visited` set. Since `neighbor` satisfies the condition `(neighbor not in visited)`, it means `neighbor` was not already in the `visited` set before this line of code was executed. Therefore, the `visited` set now includes all the nodes in its previous state plus the `neighbor` node.
