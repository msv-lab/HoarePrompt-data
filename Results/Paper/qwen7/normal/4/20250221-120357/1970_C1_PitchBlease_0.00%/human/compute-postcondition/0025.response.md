Output State: The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form (neighbor, dist + 1) for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, `current` is the last unvisited neighbor of the current node that was dequeued, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, which is equal to the number of edges traversed, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all unvisited neighbors of `current`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will contain tuples of all unvisited neighbors with their respective distances from the start node. The `current` node will be the last node that was dequeued and processed, `dist` will represent the shortest path distance from the start node to the `current` node, `visited` will include all nodes that have been explored, and `target` will remain as one of the leaves of the tree, though it may or may not have been reached depending on the structure of the tree and the traversal path.
