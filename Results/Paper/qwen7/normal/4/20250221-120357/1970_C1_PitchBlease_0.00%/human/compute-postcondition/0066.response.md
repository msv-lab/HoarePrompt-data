Output State: The `queue` contains tuples of all nodes that can be reached from the starting node, along with their respective distances from the starting node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been processed. The `current` node is the last node that was dequeued from the `queue`. If any node in `tree[current]` has been visited, it is not added to the `queue` again. The `dist` value represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the current node.

In more detail, the `queue` will contain all nodes that can be reached from the starting node, each paired with its distance from the starting node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been explored. The `current` variable will be the last node that was dequeued from the `queue`, and `dist` will be the shortest distance from the starting node to this `current` node. If the target node is found during the process, the function would return the distance, but since we are only describing the final state of the loop, we assume the loop completes without finding the target.
