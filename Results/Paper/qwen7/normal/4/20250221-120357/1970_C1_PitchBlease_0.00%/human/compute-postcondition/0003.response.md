Output State: **`queue` is now a deque containing the tuple that was second in the original queue, `current` is the integer from the tuple that was dequeued (originally the `start`), `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and the `current` node.**

In this output state, the first tuple from the deque `queue` (which was originally (`start`, 0)) has been removed using `popleft()`. The values of `current` and `dist` are now the values from the dequeued tuple. The `visited` set includes both the original starting node and the current node after dequeuing.
