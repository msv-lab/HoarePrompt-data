Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\). The variable `ans1` will hold the value of `a * n` if `n > 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged. Similarly, `ans2` will hold the value of `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n > 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, for each test case, `ans1` and `ans2` will reflect the results based on the conditions provided within the loop, while `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
