Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n > 1:
        ans1 = a * n
        ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
        print(min(ans1, ans2))
    else:
        print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, and `b` is the third integer input. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, there are no additional assignments to `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user. If `n > 1`, then `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n <= 1`, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `new_t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n` if `n > 1`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n > 1`, otherwise `ans2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
