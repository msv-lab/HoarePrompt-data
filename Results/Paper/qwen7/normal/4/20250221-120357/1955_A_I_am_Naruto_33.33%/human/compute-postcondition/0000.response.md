Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the input and loop condition**: The loop will run for each line of input provided by the user. The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, which means the loop will continue until the user provides an integer input.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the user must provide at least one integer input. Therefore, the state before the loop starts must include the condition that the user has provided at least one valid integer input.

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the loop can start executing based on this input.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial State**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is determined by `int(input())`.

Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range, the only thing we need to ensure is that the loop can start by receiving at least one valid integer input from the user.

### Final State:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The user must provide at least one valid integer input for the loop to start.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the user must provide at least one valid integer input**.
