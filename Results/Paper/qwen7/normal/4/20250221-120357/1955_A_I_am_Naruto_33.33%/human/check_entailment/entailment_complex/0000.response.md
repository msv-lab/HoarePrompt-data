Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it correctly calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the regular price (`a * n`) and the promotional price (`b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
- The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the correct approach to find the minimum cost.
- The logic handles the edge case when `n = 1` by printing just the price `a`.
- The program structure and logic align with the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
