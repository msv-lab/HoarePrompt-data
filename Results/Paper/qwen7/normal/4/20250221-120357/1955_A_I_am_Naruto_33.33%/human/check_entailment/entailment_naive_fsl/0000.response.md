Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than half the single price `a`. In such cases, it is always cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at price `a`. For example, consider the input:

```
3 5 10
```

Here, the promotion price `b` (10 burles) is less than half the single price `a` (5 burles). The correct minimum cost should be `3 * 5 = 15` burles, but the program calculates `10 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 17.5`, which rounds down to 17 (since we cannot have a fraction of a burle), making the total 17 burles instead of 15. This is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
