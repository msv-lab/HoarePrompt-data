Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`.**

The code assigns the value of `a * n` to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
