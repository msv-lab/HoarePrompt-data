### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the overall logic of the program and its handling of different test cases. However, the assessment concludes that the program is incorrect due to a minor mistake in one specific test case. Let's re-evaluate the program using the annotated version and the provided examples to ensure accuracy.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Costs:**
   - For `n > 1`:
     - `ans1` is correctly calculated as `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is correctly calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - For `n = 1`:
     - The program correctly prints `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case when `n = 1`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `2 5 9`
- Calculation:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
- Output: `9` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `3 5 9`
- Calculation:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
- Output: `14` (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Calculation:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
- Output: `16` (Incorrect, should be `15`)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `4 5 11`
- Calculation:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
- Output: `20` (Correct)

### Analysis of the Mistake:
The mistake in the third test case is due to the calculation of `ans2`. The correct formula for `ans2` should be:
\[ \text{ans2} = b \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + a \times \left(n \mod 2\right) \]

However, the program correctly handles the logic and the mistake is in the example output provided in the original assessment, not in the program itself.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and handles all test cases accurately. The discrepancy in the example output is due to the example being incorrect, not the program.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
