Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `new_t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n` if `n > 1`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n > 1`, otherwise `ans2` remains unchanged.**

The code reads three integers from the user and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. It does not directly assign values to `ans1` and `ans2` unless `n > 1`. Since the conditions for calculating `ans1` and `ans2` are not met yet, they remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `new_t` is also unchanged as it was part of the initial state and not affected by the code snippet.
