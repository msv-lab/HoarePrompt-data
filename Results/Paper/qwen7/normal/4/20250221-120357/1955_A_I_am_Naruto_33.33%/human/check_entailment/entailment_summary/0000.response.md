Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases \(t\) and processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly calculates the cost of buying \(n\) yogurts without any promotion (\(a \times n\)) and with the promotion applied (\(b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \times (n \mod 2)\)).
3. The logic to determine which cost is lower (either \(a \times n\) or \(b \times \frac{n}{2} + a \times (n \mod 2)\)) is sound. This ensures that Maxim gets the minimum cost for buying \(n\) yogurts.
4. The program correctly handles the edge case where \(n = 1\), printing just the price \(a\) for a single yogurt.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically correct and matches the problem description and expected output.

Correctness: **True**
