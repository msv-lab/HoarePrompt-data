Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans2` based on the values of `b`, `n`, and `a`. Specifically, `ans2` is computed as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
