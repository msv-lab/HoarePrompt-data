Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Costs**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`.
     - `ans2`: The cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price `b`, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price `a`.
   - If `n <= 1`, the program simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price `a`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Base Case (`n <= 1`)**:
   - If `n == 1`, the cost is simply `a`.
   - This part of the code is correctly implemented.

2. **General Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`, which is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
   - `ans2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, which accounts for the promotional price for pairs and the regular price for any remaining single yogurt.
   - The logic here ensures that we maximize the use of the promotional price while minimizing the cost.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is even and the edge case where `n` is odd correctly.
   - For even `n`, `n // 2` pairs are bought at `b` and no additional single yogurt is needed.
   - For odd `n`, `n // 2` pairs are bought at `b` and one additional single yogurt is bought at `a`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 1 = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9`

- **Example 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `14`

- **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Minimum cost: `15`

- **Example 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 2 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20`

All these examples match the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
