Output State: **`k` must be greater than 2, `d` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, `g` is increased by 2, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 2`**

Explanation: The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. Since `g` was previously increased by 1 before this line, it is now increased by 2 in total. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
