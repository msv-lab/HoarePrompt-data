Output State: **The state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial state of the variables is unknown, they remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
