#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, where a_i represents the durability of the i-th ship. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, `z` will be equal to `t - 1`, `a` will be a list of integers obtained from the final input split by spaces, `n` will be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, and `k` will be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space.
    #
    #The loop processes the input `a` based on the value of `k`. Depending on the value of `k`, different operations are performed on `a`. If `k` is one of the special values like 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999, etc., `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is such that it causes elements in `a` to be decremented, the process continues until `k` is fully applied or `a` contains non-positive elements. In the end, `a` will be transformed based on the operations performed over all iterations, and `k` will reflect the final value after processing through the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers representing the durability of the ships. Based on the value of \( k \), the function either prints a specific integer directly or modifies the list \( a \) by decrementing its elements. Finally, it prints the count of zero-valued elements in the list \( a \) after all modifications.
