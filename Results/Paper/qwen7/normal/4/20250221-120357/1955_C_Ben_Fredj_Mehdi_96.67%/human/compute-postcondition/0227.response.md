Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `a[d]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[d]` by 1. Since `a[d]` was previously decreased by 1, it is now further decreased by 1. The other variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
