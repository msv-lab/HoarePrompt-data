Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string.
   - `n` is the first element of `a`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space.

2. **Conditions for No Changes:**
   - If `k` equals 1999999998, no changes occur.
   - If `k` equals 1999999999, no changes occur.
   - If `k` equals 99999999999, no changes occur.
   - If `k` equals 99999999999999, `a` is updated according to specific decrement rules.

3. **Conditions for Updating `a`:**
   - If `n` is 1 and `k` is 10000000000000, `a` is updated to a list of integers.
   - Otherwise, if `k` does not equal 3000000000, `i` will be equal to `k // 2`, `a[d]` will be decremented by the total number of iterations, and `g` will be incremented each time `a[g]` is decremented to 0.
   - If `a[d]` reaches 0 during any iteration, `d` will be decremented accordingly.
   - The condition `k % 2 == 1` remains true throughout the loop.

4. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `z` is used in the loop head.
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `z` starts at 1, for the next iteration, `z` will be 2.
   - `t` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `a`, `n`, and `k` will be updated based on the conditions mentioned above.

Given these points, let's determine the new state for the next iteration:

- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `z` will be 2.
- `a`, `n`, and `k` will be updated based on the conditions provided.

Since the exact updates to `a`, `n`, and `k` depend on the specific values of `k` and other conditions, we cannot provide a definitive new state without knowing the exact values. However, we know that `t` must remain greater than 0 and `z` will be 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space**.
