The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers representing the durability of the ships. Based on the value of \( k \), the function either prints a specific integer directly or modifies the list \( a \) by decrementing its elements. Finally, it prints the count of zero-valued elements in the list \( a \) after all modifications.
