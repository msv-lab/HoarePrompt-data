At which points in the program could such an exception occur?

- The exception can occur when trying to access elements `a[g]` or `a[d]` using indices that are out of bounds, or when trying to convert these elements to integers using `int(a[g])` or `int(a[d])`.

Summarize what the try except statement accomplishes:

- The `try` block attempts to decrement the values of `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1.
- If any of the operations inside the `try` block raise an exception (such as an `IndexError` or a `ValueError`), the `except` block is executed, and the loop or statement is broken.

What the program output state is after it is executed:

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[d]` is decreased by 1. If `a[d]` is initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the loop or statement is broken, and the state is unknown.**
