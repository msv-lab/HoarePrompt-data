Output State: **`k` must be greater than 2, `d` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, `g` is increased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 2`**

Explanation: 
- The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[d]` by 1. Since `a[d]` was initially equal to 0 (from the precondition), after the operation, `a[d]` becomes -1.
- The precondition that `g` is increased by 1 remains unchanged because the code does not directly modify `g`. However, since `g` was increased by 1 due to the precondition, and then `a[g]` is decreased by 1 twice, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 2`.
- All other variables remain unaffected by the given code.
