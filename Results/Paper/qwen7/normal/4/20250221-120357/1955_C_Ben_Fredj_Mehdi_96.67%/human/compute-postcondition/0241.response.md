Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is updated to a list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in `a`, then `i` remains unchanged, `a[d]` is decremented by the total number of iterations, and `g` is incremented each time `a[g]` is decremented to 0. If `k` is less than the sum of elements in `a`, `i` will be set to `k // 2`, `a[d]` will be decremented by the total number of iterations, and `g` will be incremented each time `a[g]` is decremented to 0. If `a[d]` reaches 0 during any iteration, `d` will be decremented accordingly. The condition `k % 2 == 1` remains true throughout the loop.
