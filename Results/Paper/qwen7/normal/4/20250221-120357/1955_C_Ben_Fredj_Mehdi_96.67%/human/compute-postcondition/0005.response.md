Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, and converts each part into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t` and `z` remain unchanged. `n` and `k` are set to the first and second elements of the list `a`, respectively.
