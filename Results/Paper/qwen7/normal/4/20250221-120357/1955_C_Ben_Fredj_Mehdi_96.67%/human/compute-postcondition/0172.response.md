Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `z` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input string
- `n` is the first element of `a`
- `k` is the second element of `a`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is based on the variable `z`. The loop runs as long as `z < t`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
Since `z` starts at 0 and the loop runs for `t` iterations, the next value of `z` will be 1. Therefore, we need to update the state for `z` to be 1.

### Other Variables
- `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Updated State
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`**
