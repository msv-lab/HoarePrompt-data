Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `a[g]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[g]` by 1. Since `a[g]` was initially an integer (as it is being converted to an integer and then decremented), it now holds a value that is 1 less than its previous value. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
