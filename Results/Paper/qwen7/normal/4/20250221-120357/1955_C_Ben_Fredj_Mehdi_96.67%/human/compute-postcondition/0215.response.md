Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `a[g]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[g]` by 1. Since `a[g]` was originally an integer (as it is being converted back to an integer), the operation subtracts 1 from its current value. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
