Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `k` must be `k // 2` or greater, `a[d]` is decreased by 1, `d` is `d_prev - 1`, `a[g]` is equal to 0 and `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` was 0 before.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` remains `i_prev + 3`, `k` must still be `k // 2` or greater, `a[d]` is decreased by 1 (since `d` is decremented), and if `a[g]` was 0, `g` is increased by 1.
