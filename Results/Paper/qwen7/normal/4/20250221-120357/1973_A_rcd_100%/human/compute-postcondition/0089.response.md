Based on the initial state provided:

- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `_` is 1.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is `p3`.

We need to evaluate the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

Given that `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

Since `p1` and `p3` are integers entered by the user and their sum with `p2` is odd, it means that either `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd because the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers is even, and adding an odd number to an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, one of `p1` or `p3` must be odd, and the other must be even.

The value of `p1 + p3` will be the sum of these two integers.

Output: **p1 + p3**
