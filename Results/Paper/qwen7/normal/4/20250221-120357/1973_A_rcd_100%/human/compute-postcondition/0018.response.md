Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), but this variable does not affect the print statement.
- `_` is 1, but again, it does not affect the print statement.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is equal to `p3`.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the expression `p1 - x + p3`:

1. `x` is 0.
2. `y` is equal to `p3`.
3. Therefore, `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1` because `x` is 0.
4. So, `p1 - x + p3` becomes `p1 + p3`.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the expression `p1 + p3` will be an integer that contributes to the odd sum.

Thus, the print statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
