The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
