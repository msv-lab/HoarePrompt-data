Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`.**

The code `y = p3` assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd remains valid.
