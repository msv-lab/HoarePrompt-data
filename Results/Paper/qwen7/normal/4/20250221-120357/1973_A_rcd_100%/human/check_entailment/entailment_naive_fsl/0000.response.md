Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores should be achievable through a combination of wins, losses, and draws. However, the program incorrectly prints `2` for this case, which is not the maximum possible number of draws. The correct output should be `1`, as one possible scenario is that the first and second players drew one game, and the second and third players won one game against the first player.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2)) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the total points are even and if the highest score is less than or equal to the sum of the other two scores. If these conditions are met, it calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
