Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`.**
