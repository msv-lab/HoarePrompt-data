Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3`, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` was incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
