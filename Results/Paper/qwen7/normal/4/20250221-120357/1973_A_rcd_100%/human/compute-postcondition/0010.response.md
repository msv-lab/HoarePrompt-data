Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 + p2**
