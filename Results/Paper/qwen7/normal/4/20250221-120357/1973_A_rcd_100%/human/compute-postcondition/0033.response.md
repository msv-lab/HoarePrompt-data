Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `y >= x`.
- The loop body is omitted.
- The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `y`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't affect the loop continuation).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop breaks out.
- Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.

### Conditions for Continuing the Loop:
- For the loop to continue, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop condition is `y >= x`, we need to ensure that `y` is greater than or equal to `x` for the loop to continue.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` do not directly affect the loop condition `y >= x`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variables that can be adjusted to ensure the loop continues are `x` and `y`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, and `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.**
