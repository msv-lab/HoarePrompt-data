Based on the initial state provided:

- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `_` is 1.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- The program continues the loop.

The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Given that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it implies that either one or three of these integers are odd. Since the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd, the only way for the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to be odd is if one of them is odd and the other two are even, or if all three are odd.

However, the specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact sum. But we know that the sum of `p1` and `p2` will be either even or odd, but not necessarily related to the oddness of the total sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Thus, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2**
