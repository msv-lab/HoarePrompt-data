Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now equal to `p3 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
