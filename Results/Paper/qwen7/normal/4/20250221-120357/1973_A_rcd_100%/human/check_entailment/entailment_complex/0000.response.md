Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved by the given scoring rules.
4. If the sum is even, it proceeds to check if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible score for `p3` if no draws occurred between the first and second player and all draws occurred between the first and third player or the second and third player.
5. If `p3 < p1 + p2`, it enters a loop to find the maximum possible number of draws. The loop adjusts `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, and it prints `p1 - x + p3` when this condition is met. This logic is designed to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.
6. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case, which is appropriate for the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
