Output State: **`ans` is increased by 3, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The initial state shows that `ans` was already increased by 2, and now it is increased by 1 more, making it increased by 3 in total. Similarly, `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables `t1`, `t2`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
