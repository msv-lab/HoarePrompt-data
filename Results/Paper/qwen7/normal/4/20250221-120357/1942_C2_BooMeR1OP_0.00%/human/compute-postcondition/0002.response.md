Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and `a` is a list where each element is reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a = [(num - 1) for num in a]` iterates over each element in the list `a` and subtracts 1 from each element. Since the initial state of `a` contains three integers assigned from the input, after executing the code, each element in `a` will be its original value minus 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
