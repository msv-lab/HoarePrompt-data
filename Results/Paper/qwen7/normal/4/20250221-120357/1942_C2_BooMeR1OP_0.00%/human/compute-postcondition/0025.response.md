Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 3, `i` is incremented by 1, and both `t1` and `t2` are in the `present` set if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`. If the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true, then `ans` is increased by 3 and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition is false, the values of `ans` and `i` remain as they were before the if statement.
