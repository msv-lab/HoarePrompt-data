Output State: **`gaps` is `[gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `next_elem` is `a[3] + (n if 1 == x - 1 else 0)`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `gap` to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
- Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is updated to 3.
- `next_elem` is recalculated as `a[3] + (n if 1 == x - 1 else 0)`.
- `gap` is now `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
