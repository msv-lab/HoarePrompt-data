Postcondition: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `2 * y + gap` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`), `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `y` is decreased by `2 * y`; otherwise, `y` is decreased by `pairs`.
