Output State: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x`, and `i` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The `gaps.sort()` method sorts the list `gaps` in ascending order. However, the sorting operation does not change the content of `gaps` itself but sorts it in place.
- The variable `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value, which was equal to the total number of iterations `x`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged from its previous value, which was also equal to `x`.

Therefore, the output state retains the information about the sorted list of positive `gap` values, the value of `ans` being equal to the total number of iterations `x`, and `i` being equal to `x`.
