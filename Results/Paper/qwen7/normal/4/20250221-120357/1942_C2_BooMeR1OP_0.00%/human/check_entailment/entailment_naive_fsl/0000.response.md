Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `y` is zero correctly. According to the problem description, if `y` is zero, no additional vertices can be chosen, and the number of triangles formed should only consider the initial `x` vertices. However, the program attempts to use `y` to increase the number of triangles, which is incorrect when `y` is zero.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

The program should output `4` because with only the initial 4 vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 4. However, the current implementation will incorrectly attempt to use `y` (which is 0), leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should check if `y` is zero and handle it separately before attempting to use `y` to increase the number of triangles.
