Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The values of `t1` and `t2` are dependent on the current value of `i`, which is updated to `i + 1` after their calculation. Therefore, `t1` and `t2` remain as they are, with `t1` being `(a[i] + 1) % n` and `t2` being `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The value of `i` is also updated to `i + 1`.
