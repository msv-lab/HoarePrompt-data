Output State: **`t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`**

Explanation: The initial value of `t1` is given as `(a[i] + 1) % n`. The code snippet assigns `(a[i] + 2) % n` to `t2`. Since `a[i]` remains unchanged, `t2` is updated to reflect the new expression. The value of `n` remains the same, and no other variables are affected.
