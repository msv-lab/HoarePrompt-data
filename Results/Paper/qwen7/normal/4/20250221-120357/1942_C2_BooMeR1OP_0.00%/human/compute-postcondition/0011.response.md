Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `t1` is not in `present`, and `t2` is in `present`**.

This means that the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions involving `t1` and `t2` remain unchanged. `t1` is still `(a[i] + 1) % n` and is not present in the set `present`, and `t2` is still `(a[i] + 2) % n` and is present in the set `present`.
