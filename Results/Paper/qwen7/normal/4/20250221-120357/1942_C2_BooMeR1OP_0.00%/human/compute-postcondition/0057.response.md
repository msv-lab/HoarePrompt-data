Postcondition: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, and must not be empty, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `2 * y` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`), `i` is equal to `x`, and `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2**.

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`, then `ans` is incremented by `gap`. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. In both cases, `i` remains equal to `x` and `pairs` remains equal to `gap // 2`.
