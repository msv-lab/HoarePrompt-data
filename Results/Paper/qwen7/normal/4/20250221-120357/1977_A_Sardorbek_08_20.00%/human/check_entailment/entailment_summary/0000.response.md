Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The given program attempts to solve this by checking three conditions:
  1. If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), it prints 'YES'.
  2. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
  3. If `b` and `a` (number of test cases) have the same parity, it prints 'Yes'.

However, there are issues with the logic:
- The condition `if b == c:` correctly identifies when the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, which should indeed result in a 'YES'.
- The condition `elif b < c:` incorrectly identifies when the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, which should result in a 'NO'.
- The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks the parity of `a` and `b`, but this does not correctly determine if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is irrelevant to solving the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not accurately solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
