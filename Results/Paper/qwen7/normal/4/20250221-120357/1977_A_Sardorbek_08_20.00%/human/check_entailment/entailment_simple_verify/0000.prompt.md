You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is the last integer obtained from the input split, `c` is the last integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations based on the input value of `a`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has run exactly `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and does not change throughout the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in the `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` condition is incorrect. This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is even and the desired number of cubes `c` is also even, which is not relevant to determining whether it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the difference between the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between `b` and `c` determines whether it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which correctly determines whether it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.
