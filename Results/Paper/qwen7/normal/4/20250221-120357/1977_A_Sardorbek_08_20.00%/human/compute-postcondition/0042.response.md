Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer obtained from the last input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second last input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop executions, and the final values of `b` and `c` depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. The conditions within the loop (whether `b` equals `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or the parity of `a` and `b`) do not affect the final values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` directly but influence the printed outputs during each iteration.
