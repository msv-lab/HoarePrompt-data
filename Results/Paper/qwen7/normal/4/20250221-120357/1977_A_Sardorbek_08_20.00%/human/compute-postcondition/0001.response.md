State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `a`, and the implicit variable `range(a)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `a` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1 (since `range(a)` requires `a` to be a non-negative integer).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as per the behavior of the `range(a)` function.
4. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and its value does not affect whether the loop runs or not.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` to ensure it is a non-negative integer and at least 1, and `i` to be initialized to 0.
