Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `b` and `c` are updated to integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `b` and the second integer to `c`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as does `a`, `i`, and `q`.
