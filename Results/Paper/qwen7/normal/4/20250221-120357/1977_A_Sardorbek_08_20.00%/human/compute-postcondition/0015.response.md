Output: **No**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- `a` is an input integer whose parity (odd or even) is different from `b`'s parity.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `b` and `c` are integers with the condition that `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string "No" to the console. Since no other variables or objects are being referenced in this print statement, the output is exactly as written: "No".
