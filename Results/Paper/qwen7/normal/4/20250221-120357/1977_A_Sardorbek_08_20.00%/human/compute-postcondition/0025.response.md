Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
- `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects within the `print` statement that need to be evaluated further.

Output: **YES**
