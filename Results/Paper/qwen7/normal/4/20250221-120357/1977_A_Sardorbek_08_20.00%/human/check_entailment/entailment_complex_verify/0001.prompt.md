You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is the last integer obtained from the input split, `c` is the last integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations based on the input value of `a`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has run exactly `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and does not change throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `a`. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if both `b` and `a` have the same parity (both even or both odd). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to process each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves:
     - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES' because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means he could just add cubes without removing any.
     - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because he cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
     - If `a % 2 == b % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition seems to be checking if the number of moves (`b`) and the number of cubes (`c`) have the same parity (both even or both odd).
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Condition for Printing 'Yes':**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. This should be `if b % 2 == c % 2:`. The parity check should ensure that the final number of cubes (`c`) matches the parity of the total number of moves (`b`).

2. **Redundant Variable `q`:**
   - The variable `q = (b, c)` is not used anywhere in the program and can be removed.

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - The program uses 'YES' and 'NO' which might not be accepted if the problem specifies exact case sensitivity (e.g., 'Yes' and 'No').

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program has a logical error in the condition where it checks the parity. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
