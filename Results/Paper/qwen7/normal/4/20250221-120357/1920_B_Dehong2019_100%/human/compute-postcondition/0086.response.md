Output State: **`i` is 0; `k` must be greater than 0; `ans1` is `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans1` is updated to be the value of `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
