Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer in the initial state.
