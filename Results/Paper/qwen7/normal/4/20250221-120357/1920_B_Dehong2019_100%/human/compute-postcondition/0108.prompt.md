Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and t is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is the final value of `x`; `ans1` is the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be less than or equal to 0 because the loop runs from `i` in `range(k)`. The variable `i` will take the final value of `x` since `x` is the upper limit of the loop. The variable `ans1` will be updated in each iteration by adding `a[i]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. If `i + x` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans1` is simply incremented by `a[i]`. `ans2` is updated in each iteration to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` from the previous iteration. Therefore, `ans2` will be equal to the final value of `ans1` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans1` will be the maximum value it attains during any iteration of the loop, starting from the initial value of `ans1` minus the sum of `2 * a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `x`. `i` will be equal to `x + k`, where `k` is the total number of iterations the loop executed. `x` will still be less than or equal to 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1` (since `i` starts from `x` and goes up to `x + k`, and `i + x < n` must hold true for the last iteration). `ans2` will also be the maximum value `ans1` attains during any iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, `ans1` and `ans2` will hold the highest value `ans1` reaches throughout the loop's iterations, with `i` ending at the last index processed by the loop, and both `x` and `ans2` remaining as they were initialized.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is the sum of `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 4 * a[2 + x] + a[2]` if `2 + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + 2 * a[2]` if `2 + x >= n`, and this pattern continues until the last iteration where `ans1` is updated based on whether `i + x < n` or not, and `ans2` is equal to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` throughout all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must still be greater than 0, `ans1` will be the result of applying the loop's operations up to `k` times, and `ans2` will hold the highest value that `ans1` has taken during any iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
