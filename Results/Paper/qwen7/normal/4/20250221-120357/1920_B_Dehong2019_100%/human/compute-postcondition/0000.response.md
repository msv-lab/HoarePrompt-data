Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, for each test case n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The code provided does not change any variable values or perform any operations, so the conditions remain the same.**

The given code is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would alter the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
