Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that `ans1` has been incremented by the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is now `x + 1`. The condition that `k` must be greater than `x + 1` remains unchanged. The value of `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `ans1`.
