Output State: `i` is equal to `x`; `ans1` is decreased by the sum of `2 * a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `x`; `x` is less than or equal to 0.

To explain this output state in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the final value of `x` (since `i` increments with each iteration and the loop runs until `i` reaches `x`). The variable `ans1` will have been decreased by twice the value of each element in the list `a` for every index from 0 to `x-1`. Additionally, the variable `x` will be less than or equal to 0 because the loop continues as long as `i < x`, and once `i` equals `x`, the loop terminates.
