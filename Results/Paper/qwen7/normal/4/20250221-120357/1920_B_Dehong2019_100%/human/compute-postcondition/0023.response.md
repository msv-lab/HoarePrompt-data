Output State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` before the operation.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged. `ans1` is updated based on its previous value and the new subtraction.
