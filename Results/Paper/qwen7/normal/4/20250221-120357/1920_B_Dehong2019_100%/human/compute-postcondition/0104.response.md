Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 4 * a[i + x] + a[i]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + 2 * a[i]` if `i + x >= n`, and `ans2` is equal to `max(ans1, ans2)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new relationship for `ans2` based on the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
