Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, the initial state before the loop starts should reflect this assignment. The value of `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the final state**: The state before the loop starts should include the fact that `t` is a positive integer and that `_` is not relevant to the adjustment since it is a throwaway variable.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**`t` is a positive integer**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer**
