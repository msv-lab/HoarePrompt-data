Output State: **`i` is equal to `x`; `ans1` is equal to itself minus the sum of `2 * a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `x`; `x` is less than or equal to 0; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. This does not change the values of any variables. The previous state of `i` being equal to `x` and `ans1` being decreased by the sum of `2 * a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `x` remains unchanged. Additionally, `x` is still less than or equal to 0.
