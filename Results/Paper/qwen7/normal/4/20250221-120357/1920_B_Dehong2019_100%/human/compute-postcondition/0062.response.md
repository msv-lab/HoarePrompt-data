Output State: **`ans1` is the maximum of `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x]` and `ans2`, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. The values of `ans1`, `i`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Additionally, if `i + x < n`, `ans1` would be further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, but since this condition is not checked here, we consider the general case where `ans1` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `ans2`.
