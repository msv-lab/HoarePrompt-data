Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` decrements `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the line of code, `i` is updated to 2. The value of `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`. The precondition that `x` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
