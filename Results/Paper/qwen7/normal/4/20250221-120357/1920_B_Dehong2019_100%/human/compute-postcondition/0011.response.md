Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by 4 (2 * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, it implies `a[i]` is `a[2]`. Since no specific value for `a[2]` is given, we assume it to be a variable. However, the operation performed is `ans1 -= a[2] * 2`, which means `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[2]`. The value of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
