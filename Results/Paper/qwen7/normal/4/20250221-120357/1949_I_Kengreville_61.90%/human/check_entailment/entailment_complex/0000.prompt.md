Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

# Annotated Functions:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x and y are lists of n integers each, representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, and r is a list of n integers, representing the radii of the disks respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())

    #State: Output State: `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is an integer value input by the user. The variable `i` is equal to `n`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values with all elements set to `False`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x`, `y`, and `r` will contain the integer values provided by the user for each index up to `n-1`. The loop has incremented `i` to `n`, indicating that all elements in `x`, `y`, and `r` have been populated. All other variables (`coef1`, `coef0`, `nodes`, and `visited`) remain in their initial state as they were not modified within the loop.

    #State: All elements in `coef0` and `coef1` are either 0 or 1, `nodes` contains a list of all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, `c0` and `c1` are sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in `nodes` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of disk centers defined by their x and y coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on these disks to determine if any connected component of disks has a non-zero sum of a specific coefficient (`coef1`). If such a component exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any explicit value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, and `visited`, `nodes`, and `coef0`, `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to `False`, an empty list, and zeros respectively.

        #State: All elements in the `visited` list are set to `False`, `nodes` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists where each element is either `0` or the sum of the radii of two disks minus the value of `coef0` for one of the disks, depending on whether the distance condition was met during the iterations.
    #State: All elements in the `visited` list are set to `False`, `nodes` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists where each element is either `0` or the sum of the radii of two disks minus the value of `coef0` for one of the disks, depending on whether the distance condition was met during the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the index `i` on a graph defined by the coordinates and radii of disks. It marks the visited status of each disk index, adds them to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the distance condition between pairs of disks. After completing the DFS, all disks are visited, and the `nodes` list contains all indices from `0` to `n-1`. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated such that each element is either `0` or the sum of the radii of two disks minus the value of `coef0` for one of the disks, depending on whether the distance condition was met.
