Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nodes` must contain at least three elements.
   - `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`.
   - `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` remains the same.
   - The values of `nodes`, `c1`, and `ok` do not change based on the loop head alone; they depend on the loop body, which is omitted here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `nodes` must still contain at least three elements.
   - `c1` and `ok` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`nodes` must contain at least three elements, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only say it is incremented by 1 without knowing the exact initial value of `i`.

So, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`nodes` must contain at least three elements, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
