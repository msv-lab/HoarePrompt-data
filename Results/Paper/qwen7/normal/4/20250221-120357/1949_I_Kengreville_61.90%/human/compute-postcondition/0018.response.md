Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j] is `-coef1[i]`; function dfs(j) is called.**

Explanation: The code `dfs(j)` calls the function `dfs` with the argument `j`. This function call does not directly modify the values of `dx`, `dy`, `coef0[j]`, or `coef1[j]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state. The only change is the function call itself.
