Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide specific values for the lists `coef0` and `coef1`, but it states that all their elements are either 0 or 1.
- The variable `nodes` contains a list of nodes that were visited during the execution of a loop.
- The variables `c0` and `c1` are sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`.
- The variable `ok` is explicitly stated to be `True` if the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in `nodes` is not equal to 0.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or values need to be substituted, the output is directly `'YES'`.
