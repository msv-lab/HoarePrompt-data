Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ok` is False, `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer value input by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer value input by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer value input by the user, `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values with all elements set to `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` is a list containing node 0, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes` must contain at least three elements, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ok` remains unchanged or becomes True if `c1` is not equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
