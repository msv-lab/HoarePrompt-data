Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the number of disks `n`, and the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - It initializes several lists and arrays to keep track of visited disks, coefficients, and nodes.
   - For each disk, it performs a DFS to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - During the DFS, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the tangency condition.
   - After exploring all connected components, it checks if any component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`.
   - If such a component exists, it prints "YES" indicating that it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency conditions.
   - If no such component exists, it prints "NO".

2. **Function `dfs`**:
   - The DFS function is called recursively to explore the graph of disks.
   - It marks disks as visited, adds them to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the distance condition between pairs of disks.
   - The function ensures that all disks are visited and the `nodes` list contains all indices from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - It uses the properties of tangency to update the coefficients and check if it's possible to decrease the sum of radii without violating the tangency conditions.
   - The implementation seems to follow the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
