Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in nodes:`. This means the variables `j` and `nodes` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `c0` is 1
   - `c1` is 1 + `coef1[j]`
   - `ok` remains unchanged
   - `i` is 2
   - `coef0[1]` is 0
   - `coef1[1]` is 1
   - `j` is the next element in `nodes`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `nodes` to iterate over. Since `j` is set to the "next element" in `nodes`, it implies that `j` was the last element processed in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will now be the next element in `nodes` after the one processed in the previous iteration.
   - `nodes` will have one less element since `j` has been processed.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `j` will be the next element in `nodes`.
- `nodes` will have one less element.

Since `ok` remains unchanged, `c0` remains 1, `c1` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`, and `i` remains 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`c0` is 1, `c1` is 1 + `coef1[j]`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes` (after the previous `j`), `nodes` has one less element**
