Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function and the `dfs` function do not handle the necessary calculations to ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency conditions.

To illustrate this, consider the following example from the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

However, the provided code does not correctly handle the logic to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency. The `dfs` function only checks for tangency and updates coefficients without ensuring that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. Therefore, the program may fail to identify valid reductions in certain scenarios.

For instance, the provided code does not explicitly check if the new radii result in a strictly decreasing sum. It only checks for tangency and updates coefficients based on that condition, which is insufficient to guarantee the desired outcome.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
