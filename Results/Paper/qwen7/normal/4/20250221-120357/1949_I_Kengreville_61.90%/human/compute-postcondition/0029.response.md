Output State: **All elements in the `visited` list are set to `False`, `nodes` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists where each element is either `0` or the sum of the radii of two disks minus the value of `coef0` for one of the disks, depending on whether the distance condition was met during the iterations.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over all possible pairs of disks (`i` and `j`). For each pair, it checks if the distance between the disks equals the sum of their radii. If so, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and calls the `dfs` function. Since the loop runs for all `j` in the range `n`, eventually all disks will be considered, setting their corresponding `visited` flag to `False`. The `nodes` list accumulates all indices from `0` to `n-1` as the loop progresses. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated based on the distance condition being met for each pair of disks.
