Postcondition: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of length `n` containing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of length `n` containing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True` except for `visited[j]`, which is now `False`, `nodes` is a list with the element `i` appended, `coef0` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `coef1` is a list of length `n` initialized to zeros, `j` is 0, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and the distance between disk `i` and disk `j` equals the sum of their radii, then `coef0[j]` is updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is updated to `-coef1[i]`, and the `dfs` function is called with argument `j`. If the condition is not met, the variables remain unchanged.**
