Output State: **`coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` must be false.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `j`, `n`, and `visited[j]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
