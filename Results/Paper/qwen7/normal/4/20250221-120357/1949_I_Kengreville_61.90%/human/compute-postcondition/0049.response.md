Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one element; `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`**

Explanation: The code `c0 += coef0[j]` increments the value of `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`. The precondition that `nodes` must have at least one element remains unchanged, and the updated value of `c0` is the original value of `c0` plus the value of `coef0[j]`.
