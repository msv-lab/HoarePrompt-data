Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will iterate based on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value; it is used to control the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The function `func_15()` returns a positive integer and its value is printed.
   - `_` is `k`.
   - A positive integer from `func_15()` is printed.

3. **Understand the loop execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. The loop variable `_` is incremented with each iteration, but it does not affect the state directly.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. Since the loop head is controlled by `func_10()`, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

Given this, the state remains the same except for the adjustment needed for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the function `func_15()` returns a positive integer and its value is printed, `_` is `k`, and a positive integer from `func_15()` is printed, and `func_10()` must return a positive integer**.
