Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input, which must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and returns this integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads two integers, n and m, from the input buffer where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and returns these two integers separated by a space.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, which represents the number of subsequent pairs of integers `(n, m)` to be read. It then reads `t` pairs of integers `(n, m)` and returns a list containing these integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` (with a constraint of 1 ≤ `rows_number` ≤ 10^4) and returns a list. This list contains the result of calling another function `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads an integer input from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it. This process is performed without requiring any parameters to be passed to the function.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Functionality: The function reads a line from standard input, decodes it, removes the trailing newline, and returns the processed line.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function processes input data consisting of t lines, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each line, it reads two space-separated integers n and m, and returns a list containing these integers [n, m].
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `rows` representing the number of test cases. It generates a list containing the result of calling `func_7()` for each of the specified `rows` test cases and returns this list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of test cases (t). After executing, the program returns this integer value (t), indicating how many test cases will follow.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  Functionality: The function reads input from the standard input, processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of three integers `t`, `n`, and `m`, and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list contains the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` for each test case, separated by spaces.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (1000000000) and the results of recursive calls to `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it processes each element `di` in `d[da]`, updates `processing` accordingly, and calculates the minimum value to update `tmp`. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the coefficients x and y, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers a and b, such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, it directly returns x = 1, y = 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters b and a % b, then uses the results to compute and return the correct x, y, and g.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of list `a` and decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to zero after the iteration, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function takes no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) and for each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)). The function writes to the standard output a sequence of positive integers, one per line, with the total number of integers written being equal to the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
