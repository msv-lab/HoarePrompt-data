Output State: `i` is greater than `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and the product of `n` and `m` does not exceed \(2 \times 10^6\); `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be greater than `m` or `i * i` will exceed `n + i`. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each iteration where the condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` was satisfied.
