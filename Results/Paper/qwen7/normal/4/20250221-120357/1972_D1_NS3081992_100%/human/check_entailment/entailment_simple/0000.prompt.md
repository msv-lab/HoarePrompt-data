Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have been decreased by the difference between `m` and the value of each element in the list `a` that is less than `m`.

    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
    #- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
    #- The loop stops when `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.
    #
    #Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `m + 1` (since the condition `i <= m` must fail), and considering the increments, `i` will be `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #
    #The value of `ans` accumulates the result of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `m`. This is because the loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, stopping just before `i` becomes `m + 1`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the loop is characterized by `i` being `m + 1`, and `ans` being the cumulative sum described above.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `func_10()` returns an integer within this range, the loop will execute between 1 and 10,000 times. Each iteration of the loop prints a positive integer returned by `func_15()`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will consist of printing a positive integer from `func_15()` for each iteration, up to a maximum of 10,000 such integers.
    #
    #In natural language: The loop will print a sequence of positive integers, one per line, with the total number of integers printed being equal to the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
