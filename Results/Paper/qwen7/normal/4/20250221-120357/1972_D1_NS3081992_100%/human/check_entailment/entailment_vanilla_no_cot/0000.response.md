Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The logic within `func_15` does not properly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check whether they satisfy the specified condition. The current implementation of `func_15` does not perform this necessary check.
