The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) and for each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)). The function writes to the standard output a sequence of positive integers, one per line, with the total number of integers written being equal to the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
