### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its components to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Functions Analysis**:
   - **`func_15`**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It iterates through possible values of \(i\) and computes \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(m\). This computation does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
   - **`func_16`**: This function processes each test case by calling `func_15` and printing the result. However, `func_15` itself does not solve the problem as described.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_15`, which in turn calls `func_7` to read \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_15` does not implement the required logic. It performs a different computation that does not match the problem's requirements.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem. The function `func_15` is not designed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem statement.
   - The program does not implement the core logic needed to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
