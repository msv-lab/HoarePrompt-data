a and b are positive integers where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\). The function is a helper function used within another function to calculate the extended Euclidean algorithm, which returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b along with the coefficients x and y such that \(ax + by = gcd(a, b)\).
