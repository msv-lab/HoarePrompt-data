Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Functions
The provided functions are mostly utility functions for reading input, but they do not seem to be directly related to solving the main problem. We will focus on the function `func_16` which appears to be the main function handling the test cases.

### Function `func_16`
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```
- This function reads the number of test cases using `func_10` and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
- `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

### Function `func_15`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
- This function reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0 and iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) (or until \(i^2 > n + i\)).
- For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Analysis
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic in `func_15` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Key Insight
The key insight is that for a given \(i\), the number of valid \(a\) values is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\). This is because \(a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\) simplifies under certain conditions to count valid \(a\) values efficiently.

#### Verification
Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - \(i = 1\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = 11\)
  - \(i = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = 3\)
  - \(i = 3\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 3}{3^2} \right\rfloor = 1\)
  - \(i = 4\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 4}{4^2} \right\rfloor = 0\)
  - Total: \(11 + 3 + 1 = 15\)
  - Subtract 1: \(15 - 1 = 14\)

This matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
