### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\),
     - \(1 \le b \le m\),
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzed Functions**:
   - **`func_15`**: This function attempts to solve a different problem. It computes the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(m\) and returns the result minus 1. This is not relevant to the current problem.
   - **`func_16`**: This function is responsible for processing the test cases. It calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result. However, `func_15` does not solve the required problem, so `func_16` also does not solve the problem.

3. **Core Issue**:
   - The core issue is that none of the functions provided in the program actually implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_15` does not compute the required number of pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem and instead calls a function (`func_15`) that solves a different problem, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem.
