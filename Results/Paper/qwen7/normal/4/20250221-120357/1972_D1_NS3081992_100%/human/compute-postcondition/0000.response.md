Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains `_` (a placeholder variable) and `func_10()`. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the loop condition. The key variable here is the result of `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Given that `func_10()` is a function, its return value is what determines the number of iterations.

3. **Initial State Information**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. Since no specific information about `func_10()` is given other than its return type being an integer, we assume it returns a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `func_10()` must return a positive integer**.
