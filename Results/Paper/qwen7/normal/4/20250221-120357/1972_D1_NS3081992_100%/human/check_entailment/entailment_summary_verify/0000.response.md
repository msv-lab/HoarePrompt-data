### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summaries and Their Usage:**
   - `func_16` is called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is read from standard input. This suggests that `func_16` should handle the main logic for each test case.
   - `func_15` is called within `func_16` and seems to be intended to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_15`:**
   - The function `func_15` takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates how many times `i * i` divides `n + i` and adds this count to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Function `func_16`:**
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - It then calls `func_15` for each test case and writes the result to standard output.

4. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Evaluation:**
   - The function `func_15` does not directly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It seems to be attempting to count something related to divisors but not the correct divisor count needed for the problem.
   - The function `func_16` correctly processes the test cases and calls `func_15` for each, but `func_15` is not solving the problem as required.

Given that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem, and `func_16` relies on it, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate because the provided program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem.
