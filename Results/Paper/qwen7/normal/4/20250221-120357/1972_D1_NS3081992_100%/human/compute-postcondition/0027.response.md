Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`.**
