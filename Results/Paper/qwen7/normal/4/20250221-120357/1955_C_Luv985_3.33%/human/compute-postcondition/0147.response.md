Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
