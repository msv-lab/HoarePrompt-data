Postcondition: `l` is either 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is adjusted according to the if condition (either `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` or remains unchanged), `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is adjusted to either `a[r] - mi` or `a[r] - mi` (depending on the if condition), and `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1; `t` is `k % 2`.
