Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `l` is increased by 1, and `a[l]` is now 0; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain in their previously described states.
