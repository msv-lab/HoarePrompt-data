Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: If `a[l]` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 2. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part, updating the value of `ans` to 2 regardless of other conditions.
