Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`, `n` remains an integer from the input, and `k` is now an integer from the input.
