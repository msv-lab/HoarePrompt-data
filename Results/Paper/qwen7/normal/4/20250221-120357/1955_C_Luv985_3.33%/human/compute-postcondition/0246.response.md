Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{15}). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters: the number of test cases `t`, a list of integers `a`, and another integer `k`. The function processes each test case according to the provided constraints and returns a result for each one.
