Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is a string from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `T` is also unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The initial condition that `T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1` is not possible for any real number, but since we are updating the type of `n`, we keep the other conditions as they are.
