Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is a string from input, `k` is a string from input**

Explanation: The code `n, k = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter. The first part is assigned to `n` and the second part to `k`. The value of `T` is updated to `T - 1` according to the initial state, and `n` and `k` are assigned strings from the input.
