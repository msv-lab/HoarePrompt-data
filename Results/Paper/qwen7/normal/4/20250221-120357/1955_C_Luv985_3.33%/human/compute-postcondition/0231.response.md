Postcondition: **`a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 4 or 3 (depending on the initial value), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `a[2]` and `a[r]` will be decreased by `mi`, `k` will be decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` will remain as 3, `r` will be `n - 2` and must be greater than 0, `ans` will be either 4 or 3 depending on the initial value, `mi` will still be the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, and `t` will be `k % 2`.
