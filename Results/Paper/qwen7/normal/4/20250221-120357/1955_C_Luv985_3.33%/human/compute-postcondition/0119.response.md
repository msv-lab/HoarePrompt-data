Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[l]` (which is `a[0]` since `l` is 0) by the value of `mi`. The other variables (`l`, `r`, and `mi`) remain unchanged.
