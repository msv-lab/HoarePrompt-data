Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, when using `range(n)`, the loop starts with `i` set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not run even once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `t` (which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) is not directly related to the loop execution and can remain as is.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
