Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is the first integer entered by the user
   - `b` is the second integer entered by the user
   - Either both `a` and `b` are odd integers, or either `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`, or neither `a` nor `b` is half of the other.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, and either both `a` and `b` are odd integers, or either `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`, or neither `a` nor `b` is half of the other.**
