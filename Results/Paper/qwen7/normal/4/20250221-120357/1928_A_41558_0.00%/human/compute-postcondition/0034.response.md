Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user on the last iteration, and the value of `a` and `b` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration. The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. If the conditions inside the loop (both `a` and `b` being odd, or `a / 2` equaling `b` or `b / 2` equaling `a`) are met for any input pair, the loop will print 'NO' for those specific inputs and continue to the next pair. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will reflect the last valid input pair that was processed by the loop.
