Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The logic in the program needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it correctly identifies whether a new rectangle can be formed.

### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions for Printing 'NO':**
   - The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO'. This is because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides unless one of the dimensions is even.
   - It also checks if either \(a / 2\) equals \(b\) or \(b / 2\) equals \(a\). If this condition is met, it prints 'NO'. This is because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, the only possible way to cut would result in two identical rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Condition for Printing 'YES':**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.

### Correctness Check:

Let's verify the logic against the examples provided:

- **Test Case 1:** \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so the program prints 'NO'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'NO' (Correct).

- **Test Case 2:** \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is even, and the other is odd. Since \(a / 2 = 1\), the program prints 'NO'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'NO' (Correct).

- **Test Case 3:** \(2 \times 6\)
  - Both dimensions are even, and neither dimension is exactly half of the other. The program should check if it can form a new rectangle.
  - By cutting the \(2 \times 6\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and then arranging them to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, the program should print 'YES'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'YES' (Correct).

- **Test Case 4:** \(3 \times 2\)
  - One dimension is odd, and the other is even. The program should check if it can form a new rectangle.
  - By cutting the \(3 \times 2\) rectangle into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and then arranging them to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, the program should print 'YES'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'YES' (Correct).

- **Test Case 5:** \(2 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are even, but one dimension is exactly half of the other. The program prints 'NO'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'NO' (Correct).

- **Test Case 6:** \(2 \times 4\)
  - Both dimensions are even, and neither dimension is exactly half of the other. The program should check if it can form a new rectangle.
  - By cutting the \(2 \times 4\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and then arranging them to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, the program should print 'YES'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'YES' (Correct).

- **Test Case 7:** \(6 \times 3\)
  - Both dimensions are even, and neither dimension is exactly half of the other. The program should check if it can form a new rectangle.
  - By cutting the \(6 \times 3\) rectangle into two \(3 \times 3\) rectangles, and then arranging them to form a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle (which is the same), the program prints 'NO'.
  - **Expected Output:** 'NO' (Correct).

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
