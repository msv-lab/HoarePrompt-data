### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'NO':**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two rectangles with odd dimensions, and no further rectangle can be formed from those pieces without violating the problem constraints.
   - If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the program also prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it does not account for all cases where a rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new rectangle. For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be split into two `2x3` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle.

3. **Condition for Printing 'YES':**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This is generally correct, but the specific conditions need to be more robust to cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed, we should consider the following:
- A rectangle can always be split into two smaller rectangles, and these smaller rectangles can often be rearranged to form a new rectangle unless the original dimensions are such that no valid rearrangement is possible.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        # Check if at least one dimension is even
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, it means the rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles with at least one even dimension, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, no new rectangle can be formed as explained earlier.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions for printing 'NO'. The corrected version checks if at least one dimension is even, which is a sufficient condition for forming a new rectangle.

**Correctness: False**
