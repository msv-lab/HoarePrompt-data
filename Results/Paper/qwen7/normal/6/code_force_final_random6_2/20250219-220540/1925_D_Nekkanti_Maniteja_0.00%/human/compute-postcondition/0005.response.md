Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `a`. Since `a` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
