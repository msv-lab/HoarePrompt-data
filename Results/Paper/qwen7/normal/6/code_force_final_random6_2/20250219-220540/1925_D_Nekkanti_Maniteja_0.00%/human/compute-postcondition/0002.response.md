Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code initializes the constant `M` to \(10^9 + 7\). This does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating the value of `M`.
