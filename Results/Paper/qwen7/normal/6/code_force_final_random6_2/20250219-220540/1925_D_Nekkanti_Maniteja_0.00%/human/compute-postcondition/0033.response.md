Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - Initially, `i` is 100000.
   - `m` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 100000.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(m)` to execute, `m` must be at least 1 (since `range(m)` includes 0 up to `m-1`). However, given that `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, this condition is already satisfied as long as `m` is an integer and meets the requirement.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to 100000, it will start the loop from there.
   - The value of `m` must be such that the loop can start, which means `m` should be at least 100000.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 100000, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000**
