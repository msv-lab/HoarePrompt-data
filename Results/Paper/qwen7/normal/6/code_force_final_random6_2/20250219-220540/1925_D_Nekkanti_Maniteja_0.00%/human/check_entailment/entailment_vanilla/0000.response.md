Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads `u`, `v`, and `f`, and adds `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - The formula used is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected value but does not seem to follow the correct logic for the problem.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is correct. This is necessary because \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) represents the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of friendship values `a` is correctly calculated.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over time.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over `k` excursions and summing these expectations.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions. The expected value for each pair `(u, v)` with friendship value `f` is given by:
\[ E(f) = f \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)^k\right) \]

Given the complexity, the correct implementation would involve:
1. Calculating the expected value for each pair.
2. Summing these expected values.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution. The formula used in the program is incorrect and does not follow the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: **False**
