Output State: **`i` is 100000, `k` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the value of `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` is still 100000, `k` must still be greater than or equal to 100000, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are now input integers.
