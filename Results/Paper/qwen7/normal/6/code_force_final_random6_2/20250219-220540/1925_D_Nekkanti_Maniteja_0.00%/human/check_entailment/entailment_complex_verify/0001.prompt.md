You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `100000 + 3 * m` because the loop increments `i` by `m` for each iteration, and it runs `3 * m` times. The variable `k` will be `3 * m` since it represents the total number of iterations the loop executed. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration, where `i` ranges from `100000 + m` to `100000 + 3 * m`. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, and it is updated in each iteration of the inner loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( s \) based on given inputs and a modulus \( M \). Specifically, it computes \( s \) using the formula \( s = \sum_{i=100000+m}^{100000+3m} (c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a) \), where \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( M \), and \( a \) is the sum of all \( f \) values provided for the test case. The function prints the result of \( s \mod M \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads `u`, `v`, and `f`, and adds `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - The formula used is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected value but does not seem to follow the correct logic for the problem.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is correct. This is necessary because \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) represents the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of friendship values `a` is correctly calculated.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over time.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over `k` excursions and summing these expectations.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions. The expected value for each pair `(u, v)` with friendship value `f` is given by:
\[ E(f) = f \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)^k\right) \]

Given the complexity, the correct implementation would involve:
1. Calculating the expected value for each pair.
2. Summing these expected values.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution. The formula used in the program is incorrect and does not follow the logic required to solve the problem.
