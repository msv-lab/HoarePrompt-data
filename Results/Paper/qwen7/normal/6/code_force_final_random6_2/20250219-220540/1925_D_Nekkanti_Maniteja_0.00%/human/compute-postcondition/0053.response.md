Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`
   - `i` is `100000 + m`
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000
   - `k` must be at least 1
   - `u` is an integer from input
   - `v` is an integer from input
   - `f` is an integer from input
   - `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs for `int(input())` times. Each iteration updates `i` to `100000 + m` and accumulates the value of `f` into `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will run one more time if `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `k`.
   - Since `i` is updated to `100000 + m` at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `100000 + m` again.
   - The value of `k` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 100000.
   - The value of `u`, `v`, and `f` will be updated based on the input for the next iteration.
   - The value of `a` will be updated to include the new value of `f` from the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `100000 + m` (unchanged).
   - `m` must still be greater than or equal to 100000 (unchanged).
   - `k` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `k + 1`.
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` will be updated based on the next input.
   - `a` will be updated to include the new value of `f`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `i` is `100000 + m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `k` must be at least 2 (since it was at least 1 before), `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.**

So, the final state is:

State: **`s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `i` is `100000 + m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `k` must be at least 2, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.**
