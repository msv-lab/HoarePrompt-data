### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and provide the correct solution approach.

#### Issues in the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Sum:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It does not account for the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair of friends and then summing these expected values.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is correct.
   - However, the use of `c` in the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not appropriate for the problem.

3. **Friendship Value Update:**
   - The program sums the friendship values for all pairs but does not update them correctly over the `k` excursions.

#### Correct Solution Approach:

1. **Calculate the Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - For each pair of friends \((u, v)\) with friendship value \(f\), the expected increase in friendship value after \(k\) excursions is given by:
     \[
     E(f) = f \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)^k\right)
     \]
   - Here, \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Sum the Expected Values:**
   - Sum the expected values for all pairs of friends to get the total expected sum of friendship values.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Finally, take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f * (1 - pow(1 - 1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2), k, M)) % M
        
        print(s % M)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original program does not correctly implement the solution. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair and summing these expected values. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
