### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. Each pair of friends has a friendship value that increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if chosen again.
3. The friendship value of a non-friend pair remains 0 and does not change.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: This is the modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`: This line computes the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(M\). However, this is not necessary for the problem, as we do not need to use the modular inverse in the way it is used here.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions.
   - `a = 0`: Initializes the sum of friendship values.
   - `for i in range(m)`: Iterates over each pair of friends.
     - `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the indices and friendship value of the pair.
     - `a += f`: Adds the friendship value to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value**:
   - `for i in range(k)`: Iterates over each excursion.
     - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`: This line adds a term to `s` that is not aligned with the expected value calculation. Specifically, `c * i * c * m` and `c * a` do not represent the correct expected value contributions.

4. **Output**:
   - `print(s % M)`: Prints the result modulo \(M\).

#### Detailed Issues:
1. **Modular Inverse Usage**:
   - The modular inverse `c` is computed but not used correctly. The problem does not require any modular inverse calculations for the expected value.

2. **Incorrect Summation**:
   - The summation `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` does not represent the expected value contribution. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected value of each pair being chosen and increasing its friendship value accordingly.

3. **Probability Consideration**:
   - The program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. The expected value should consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these values. This requires understanding the probability of each pair being chosen and the expected increase in friendship value over the \(k\) excursions.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen for the excursions.
