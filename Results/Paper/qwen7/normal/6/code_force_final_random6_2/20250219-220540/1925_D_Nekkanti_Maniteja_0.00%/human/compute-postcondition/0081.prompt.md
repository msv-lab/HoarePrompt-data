You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `100000 + 3 * m`, `k` is `3 * m`, `s` is `3 * m * c * i * c * m + 3 * m * c * a`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `100000 + 3 * m` because the loop increments `i` by `m` for each iteration, and it runs `3 * m` times. The variable `k` will be `3 * m` since it represents the total number of iterations the loop executed. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration, where `i` ranges from `100000 + m` to `100000 + 3 * m`. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, and it is updated in each iteration of the inner loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with arrays a, b, and f. The function validates the constraints for t, n, m, k, a_i, b_i, and f_i, ensuring they meet specified conditions. It then returns different outputs based on the validation results for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
