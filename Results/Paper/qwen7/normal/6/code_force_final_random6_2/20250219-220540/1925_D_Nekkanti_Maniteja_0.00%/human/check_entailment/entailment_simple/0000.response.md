Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified. This part is correct.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common choice for modulo operations to avoid overflow and ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

3. **Inverse Calculation**: The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` calculates the modular inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) under modulo \(M\). This is used later in the computation, which is correct for the formula.

4. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which is correct for accumulating the sum of the expected values.

5. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation**: The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f_i` provided in the input. This is done correctly.

6. **Main Loop Logic**:
   - The outer loop iterates `k` times, as intended.
   - Inside the loop, the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` is computed and added to `s`. However, the logic here seems flawed. Specifically:
     - The term `c * i * c * m` should represent the expected contribution of each pair being chosen at least once, but the way `i` is incremented and used seems incorrect.
     - The term `c * a` should represent the expected increase in friendship values due to previously chosen pairs, but again, the way `i` is used seems incorrect.

7. **Output**: The final result is printed modulo \(M\), which is correct.

Given the flawed logic in the main loop, particularly with how `i` is used, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The provided explanation suggests an incorrect approach to calculating the expected value.

Correctness: **False**
