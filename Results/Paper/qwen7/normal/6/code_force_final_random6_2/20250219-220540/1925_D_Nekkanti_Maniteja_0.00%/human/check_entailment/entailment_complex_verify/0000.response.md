### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The key aspects are:
1. Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value.
2. The friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
3. The probability of choosing any pair is equal.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- **Initialization**: `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Modular Inverse Calculation**: `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
- **Sum Initialization**: `s` and `a` are initialized to 0.
- **Friendship Values Summation**: `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values.
- **Main Loop**: The outer loop iterates \(k\) times, and in each iteration, `s` is updated by adding \(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\).

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
1. It does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.
2. It incorrectly uses modular inverse and multiplication.
3. It simplistically sums the friendship values without considering the expected value.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Probability of Choosing Each Pair**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in a single excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Over \(k\) excursions, the expected value contribution of a pair is \(k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Modular Inverse**:
   - The modular inverse is used to handle division in modular arithmetic, but the program's use of it is incorrect. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value directly.

3. **Summation and Expected Value**:
   - The program sums the friendship values and multiplies by a constant factor, which does not reflect the expected value calculation. The correct approach involves summing the contributions of each pair over \(k\) excursions.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the expected value for each pair.
2. Sum these expected values.

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f_i \right) \]

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided program does not correctly implement this formula.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: False**
