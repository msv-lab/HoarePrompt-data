Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and the condition for `m` remain unchanged.
