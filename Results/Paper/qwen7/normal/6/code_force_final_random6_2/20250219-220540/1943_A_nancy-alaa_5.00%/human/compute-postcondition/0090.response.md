Output State: **i is 3, n is greater than 3, first is True, mpp is a Counter object with counts of elements from the input list arr, and no further output is printed.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 3 because the loop increments `i` for each iteration. The condition `if i not in mpp.keys():` ensures that once `i` reaches a value not present in `mpp`, the loop breaks. Since it's given that the loop executes 3 times, `i` will be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to allow for 3 iterations. The variable `first` remains True because the condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first:` would have been met at some point (since it was specified that the loop executed 3 times), setting `first` to True and preventing it from being set to False within the loop. No further output is printed as the conditions to print (`i`) are not met after the third iteration.
