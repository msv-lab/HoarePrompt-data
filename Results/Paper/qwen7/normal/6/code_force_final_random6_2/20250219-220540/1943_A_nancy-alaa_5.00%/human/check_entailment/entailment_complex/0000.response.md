Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, where Alice and Bob make their moves optimally.
2. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
3. The code instead tries to find the smallest index `i` that either does not exist in the list or exists but appears exactly once. This is not equivalent to computing the MEX of the array `c` formed during the game.
4. The logic in the code does not account for the different rules of the game for Alice and Bob, nor does it construct the array `c` as specified.
5. The code does not handle the game's turns correctly and does not simulate the game state as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the provided code does not solve the problem as stated and therefore is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
