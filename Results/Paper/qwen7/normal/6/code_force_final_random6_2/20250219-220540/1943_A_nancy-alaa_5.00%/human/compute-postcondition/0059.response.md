Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, the value of `first` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block was specified, it implies that the `break` statement is breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `first`, and `mpp[i]`) remain unchanged.
