The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it determines and prints the smallest index \( i \) that either does not exist in the list or exists but appears exactly once. If no such index is found, it prints the length of the list. The function uses a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the list and iterates through the list to find the required index. The final output depends on the conditions met during the iteration.
