Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `n` is greater than 3 but does not affect the value of `i`.
- The condition about `i` being in `mpp.keys()` or not does not change the value of `i`.

The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 2.

Output: **2**
