Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. However, the current implementation does not simulate the game properly. It simply checks for the presence of indices in the array `arr` and prints the first index that is not present or has a count of 1 in the `Counter` object. This does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.

2. **Game Simulation**: The game involves alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Alice always appends an element to `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob only removes an element from `a`. The program should simulate these turns and ensure that the final state of `c` reflects the optimal moves made by both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not consider these strategies. Instead, it just checks for the presence of indices in `arr` without simulating the actual game.

4. **Output**: The output of the provided program does not match the expected results for the given examples. For instance, in the first test case, the expected output is 2, but the program might print a different value due to its incorrect logic.

Given these points, the provided program is not correct for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
