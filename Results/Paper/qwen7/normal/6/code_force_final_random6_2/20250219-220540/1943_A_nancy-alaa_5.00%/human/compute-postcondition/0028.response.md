Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `first` is either `False` if `mpp[1]` is 1, or it remains unchanged if `mpp[1]` is not 1, and if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
