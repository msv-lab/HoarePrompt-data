Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `mpp[i]` equals 1.**

Explanation: The line `first = True` does not change the value of `i`, `n`, or `mpp[i]`. It only updates the value of `first` to `False`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `first` and retains the original values of `i`, `n`, and `mpp[i]`.
