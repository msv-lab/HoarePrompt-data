### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the received amount is \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \).
   - We need to find a distribution of bets \( \text{bet}_1, \text{bet}_2, \ldots, \text{bet}_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{bet}_i < k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function computes the product of \( a \) and \( b \) divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). This is used to ensure that the division is simplified.
   - **func_2()**: 
     - Reads \( N \) (number of outcomes) and a list of multipliers \( k_i \).
     - Computes a denominator `den` by successively applying `func_1` to the multipliers.
     - Creates a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by each \( k_i \).
     - Adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
     - If `den` is non-positive, prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, prints the elements of `vprod`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The core logic of `func_2` seems to be designed to find a valid distribution of bets.
   - The use of `func_1` ensures that the division is simplified, which is crucial for handling large numbers.
   - The logic of adjusting `den` and checking if it is positive ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each outcome.
   - The example outputs match the expected behavior of the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
