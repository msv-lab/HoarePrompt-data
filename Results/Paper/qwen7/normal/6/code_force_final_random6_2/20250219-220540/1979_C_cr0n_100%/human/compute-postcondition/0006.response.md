Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` where `x` is the second element of `vals`, and `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `den` to the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`, where `x` is the second element of the list `vals`. The initial state of `N`, `vals`, and `den` remains unchanged except that `den` is now the result of the function call.
