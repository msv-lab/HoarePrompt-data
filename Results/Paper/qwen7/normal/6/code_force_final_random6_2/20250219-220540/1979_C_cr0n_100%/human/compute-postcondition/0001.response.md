Output State: **`N` is an input integer, and `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, and `vals` is populated with integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual integer values, and assigns these values to the list `vals`. The length of `vals` is equal to `N`, which was the input integer. Each element in `vals` is an integer between 2 and 20, inclusive. The initial state of `N` remains unchanged, and the new state of `vals` is updated with the input integers.
