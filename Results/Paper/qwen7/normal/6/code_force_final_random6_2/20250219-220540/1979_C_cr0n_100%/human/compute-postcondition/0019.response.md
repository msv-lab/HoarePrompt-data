Functionality: **The function reads an integer N and a list of N integers from input. It then calculates a value `den` by successively applying a function `func_1` to the elements of the list. After computing a list `vprod` of integer divisions of `den` by each element in the list, it updates `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`. If `den` becomes non-positive, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces and returns `None`.**
