Postcondition: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then `extroverts` is adjusted such that it becomes divisible by 3 while keeping `universals` unchanged. If the condition is not met, `extroverts` remains unchanged.
