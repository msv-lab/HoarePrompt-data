Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Let's consider the following test case:

- `a = 1` (introverts)
- `b = 4` (extroverts)
- `c = 1` (universals)

According to the problem description, the extroverts should be paired in groups of three. However, with 4 extroverts and only 1 universal, it is impossible to form a group of three without leaving one extrovert unaccommodated. The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not handle this edge case properly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the number of extroverts can always be paired with enough universals. Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts > 2 * universals:
        return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
```

With these corrections, the program should handle all edge cases correctly.
