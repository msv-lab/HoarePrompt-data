You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required for `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - The logic checks if the remaining universals after pairing extroverts are enough to form complete groups of three.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining universals can form a complete group with the remaining extroverts.
   - If the condition fails, it returns `None`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups, and it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly handles the condition where `extroverts` cannot be paired completely with `universals`.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where `extroverts` are more than `universals` but can still form complete groups with some `universals` left over.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly uses `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - It correctly returns `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`.
   - It correctly adds the number of tents for `introverts` to the result from `func_1`.

### Testing the Functions

Let's test the functions with the provided examples:

```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

# Function 1
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

# Function 2
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (1, 2, 3),
    (1, 4, 1),
    (1, 4, 2),
    (1, 1, 1),
    (1, 3, 2),
    (19, 7, 18),
    (0, 0, 0),
    (7, 0, 0),
    (0, 24, 0),
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)
]

for a, b, c in test_cases:
    print(f"Introverts: {a}, Extroverts: {b}, Universals: {c} -> Tents: {func_2(a, b, c)}")
```

### Expected Output

Based on the problem statement and the provided examples, the expected output should be:

```
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3 -> Tents: 3
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1 -> -1
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2 -> 3
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1 -> -1
Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2 -> 3
Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18 -> 28
Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0 -> 0
Introverts: 7, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0 -> 7
Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0 -> 8
Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000 -> 1666666667
```

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate all participants. Therefore, the program is correct.
