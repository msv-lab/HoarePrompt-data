The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers. It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3, ensuring that `extroverts` is adjusted to be divisible by 3 while keeping `universals` unchanged.
