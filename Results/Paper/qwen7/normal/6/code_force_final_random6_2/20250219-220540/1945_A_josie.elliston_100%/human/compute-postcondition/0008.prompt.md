You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. The current value of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3
    #State: Postcondition: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then `extroverts` is adjusted such that it becomes divisible by 3 while keeping `universals` unchanged. If the condition is not met, `extroverts` remains unchanged.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, ensuring that if extroverts is not divisible by 3 and extroverts % 3 + universals is greater than or equal to 3, extroverts is adjusted to be divisible by 3 while keeping universals unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers. It returns None in the first case. In the second case, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3, adjusting `extroverts` to be divisible by 3 if `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, while keeping `universals` unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, ensuring that if extroverts is not divisible by 3 and extroverts % 3 + universals is greater than or equal to 3, extroverts is adjusted to be divisible by 3 while keeping universals unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
