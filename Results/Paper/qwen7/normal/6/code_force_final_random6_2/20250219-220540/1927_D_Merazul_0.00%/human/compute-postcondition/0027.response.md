Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `k` must be at least `i_prev + 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `a` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `b` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `f` is `f & (u | v) & (u | v)`, `m` is `m - (u & ~v)`, `u` is `i in a`, `v` is `i in b`, `n` is `n - (~u & v)`**.

Explanation:
- `t` remains as `t - 2`.
- `k` must be at least `i_prev + 1`.
- `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
- `a` is a set containing one element from `R()`.
- `b` is a set containing one element from `R()`.
- `f` is `f & (u | v) & (u | v)`, which simplifies to `f & (u | v)` since `(u | v) & (u | v)` is just `(u | v)`.
- `m` is `m - (u & ~v)`.
- `u` is `i in a`.
- `v` is `i in b`.
- `n` is updated to `n - (~u & v)`.
