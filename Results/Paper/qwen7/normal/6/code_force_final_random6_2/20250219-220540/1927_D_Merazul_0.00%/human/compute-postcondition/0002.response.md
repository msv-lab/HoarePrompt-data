The only variable in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to the original `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is a positive integer, it can only be zero or a positive number. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is not zero.

State: **`t` must be non-zero**
