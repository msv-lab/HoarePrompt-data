To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]` step by step.

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `'YNEOS'`: This is a string containing the characters 'Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', 'S'.
   - `[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`: This is the slicing operation on the string.

2. **Understanding the Slicing Operation**:
   - The slicing operation `s[start:stop:step]` extracts a portion of the string `s` starting from index `start` up to but not including index `stop`, with a step size of `step`.

3. **Evaluating the Conditions**:
   - `f ^ 1`: This is a bitwise XOR operation between `f` and `1`. The result depends on the value of `f`.
   - `m | n < 0`: This is a logical OR operation. It evaluates to `True` if either `m` is negative or `n` is negative, otherwise it evaluates to `False`.

4. **Combining the Conditions**:
   - `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`: This expression will evaluate to `True` if either `f ^ 1` is `True` or `m | n < 0` is `True`. If both are `False`, it will evaluate to `False`.

5. **Slicing the String**:
   - If the expression evaluates to `True`, the slicing operation will start from the beginning of the string (`0`) and go to the end (`None`) with a step of `2`, resulting in the string `'YNOS'`.
   - If the expression evaluates to `False`, the slicing operation will start from the end of the string (`-1`) and go to the beginning (`None`) with a step of `-2`, resulting in the string `'SOEN'`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - Since the initial state is after 3 iterations, and no specific values for `f`, `m`, and `n` are provided, we need to consider the general case where the expression `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` could be either `True` or `False`.

Given the nature of the problem and the lack of specific values for `f`, `m`, and `n`, the expression `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` could evaluate to either `True` or `False`. Therefore, the output will be either `'YNOS'` or `'SOEN'`.

Output: **'YNOS' or 'SOEN'**
