Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program uses `R = lambda: map(int, input().split())` and then unpacks it incorrectly. It should parse the entire input for each test case and query properly.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The logic inside the loop is flawed. It attempts to check if there are any unique elements in the specified range but does not correctly handle the queries or output the results as required.

3. **Output Format**: The program tries to output 'YNEOS' which is not aligned with the problem statement. The correct format should be printing pairs of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        q = int(input())
        
        # Track the last occurrence of each element
        last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        for i, val in enumerate(a):
            last_occurrence[val] = i
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input().split())
            l -= 1  # Adjusting 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing
            
            # Find the first occurrence within the range [l, r]
            for i in range(l, r):
                if last_occurrence[a[i]] != i:
                    print(i + 1, last_occurrence[a[i]] + 1)
                    break
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Reads the input correctly.
- Tracks the last occurrence of each element in the array.
- For each query, finds the first pair of indices where the elements are different within the specified range.
- Outputs the result in the correct format.
