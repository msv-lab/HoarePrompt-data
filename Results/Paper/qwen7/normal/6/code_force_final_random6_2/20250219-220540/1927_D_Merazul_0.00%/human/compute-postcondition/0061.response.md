Output State: **`k` is the second element of R(), `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing one element from R().**

Explanation: The code `a = {*R()}` creates a set `a` by unpacking the result of the function `R()`. Since `R()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of the set `a`, but we know it contains exactly one element from `R()`. The values of `k` and `t` remain unchanged.
