Output State: **`t` is equal to its original value minus 1, `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `t` is decreased by 1. The code snippet `*_, k = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by `R()`. The `_` is used to ignore the first element of the tuple, and `k` is assigned the second element. The value of `t` is updated to its original value minus 1, and `k` is set to the second element of the tuple from `R()`.
