Output State: **`t` is equal to its original value minus 1, `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`, `b` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `b = {*R()}` creates a set `b` from the tuple returned by `R()`. Since `a` was already defined as a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`, the tuple returned by `R()` remains the same. Therefore, both `a` and `b` will contain the same elements, and `t` and `k` retain their previous values.
