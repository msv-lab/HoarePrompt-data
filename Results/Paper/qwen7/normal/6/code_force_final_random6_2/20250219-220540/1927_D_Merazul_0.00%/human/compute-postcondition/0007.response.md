Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `k` is the second element of `R()`, `a` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `b` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `f = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
