Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 2, `c` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` increments `ans` by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The variable `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and since `c` is the next element in `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 again, making it incremented by 2 in total. The initial conditions of `ans` being incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` and `cnt[c]` being incremented by 1 remain valid and are updated accordingly.
