Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be:

1. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` (i.e., "101") and perform a cyclic shift: `101011 -> 011011`.
2. Choose the substring `[1, 2]` (i.e., "01") and perform a cyclic shift: `011011 -> 110110`.
3. Choose the substring `[4, 6]` (i.e., "110") and perform a cyclic shift: `110110 -> 111010`.
4. Choose the substring `[5, 6]` (i.e., "10") and perform a cyclic shift: `111010 -> 111001`.
5. Choose the substring `[1, 6]` (i.e., "111001") and perform a cyclic shift: `111001 -> 011111`.

The total cost is `3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 16`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost. It counts the number of zeros encountered before a '1' and adds it to the answer, which does not reflect the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
