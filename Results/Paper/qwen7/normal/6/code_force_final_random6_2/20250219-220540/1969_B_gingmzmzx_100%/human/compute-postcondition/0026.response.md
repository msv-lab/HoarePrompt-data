Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an empty list.
- `ans` is the total number of times 0 appears in the original list `s` minus the number of times 1 appears in the original list `s`.
- `zeroes` is the total number of times 0 appears in the original list `s`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `cnt` is a dictionary where the keys are elements from the original list `s` and the values are their respective counts in the original list `s`.
- `c` is the last element processed in the loop.

Since `s` is an empty list, there are no elements in `s` to count. Therefore, both the number of times 0 appears and the number of times 1 appears in `s` are 0.

Given this, the value of `ans` is calculated as follows:
\[ ans = \text{number of times 0 appears} - \text{number of times 1 appears} = 0 - 0 = 0 \]

Thus, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
