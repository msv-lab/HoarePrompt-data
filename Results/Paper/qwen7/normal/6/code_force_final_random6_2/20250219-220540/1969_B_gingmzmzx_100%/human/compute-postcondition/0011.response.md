Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is [1, 0], `c` is not 0**

Explanation: The line `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to the current value of `ans`. Since `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, `cnt[0]` is `1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
