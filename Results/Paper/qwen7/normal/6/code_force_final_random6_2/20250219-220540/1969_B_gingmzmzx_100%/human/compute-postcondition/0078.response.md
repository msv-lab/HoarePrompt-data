Output State: **`cnt[c]` is `cnt[c] + 1`; `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` increments `ans` by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The initial state tells us that `ans` is incremented by either 1 (if `cnt[1] > 0`) or by `zeroes - cnt[0]`. Since the code directly uses `zeroes - cnt[0]` for incrementing `ans`, the value of `ans` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain in their initial conditions as described.
