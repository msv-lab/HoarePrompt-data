Output State: **`c` is the next element in `s`, `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The variable `c` is the next element in `s`, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. The value of `zeroes` remains unchanged, and `cnt[0]` is updated to its new value which is `cnt[0] + 1`.
