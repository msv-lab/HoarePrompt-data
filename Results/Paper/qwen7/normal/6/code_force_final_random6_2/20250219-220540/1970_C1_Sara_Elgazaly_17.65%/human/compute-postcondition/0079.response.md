Output State: `s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last remaining element in `lst[x]` after all possible pops, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and after all iterations of the loop, `lst[x]` is either empty or contains no elements that can be popped because the loop has terminated.

This final state occurs because the loop continues to pop elements from `lst[x]` until it is empty. Once `lst[x]` is empty, the condition `lst[x] != []` becomes false, and the loop terminates. At this point, `s` will be set to `not s`, which means it will be `False` if it was `True` before the last iteration, or `True` if it was `False`. However, since the loop exits when `lst[x]` is empty, `s` will be `False` after the loop completes. Additionally, `x` will be set to `y` just before the loop exits, making `x` equal to `y`.
