Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(int(input())):` statement. The key variables here are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `s` is an input string from the user.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `int(input())` remains the same.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `i` would be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) must be less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - The variable `int(input())` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `int(input())` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is an input string from the user, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `i` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` remains the same**
