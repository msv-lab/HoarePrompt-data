Postcondition: **The loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is equal to the integer value of the input, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is even. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the sum is odd.**
