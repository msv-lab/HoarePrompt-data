Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is equal to `int(input())`, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is equal to the integer value of the input, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is even. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the sum is odd.
