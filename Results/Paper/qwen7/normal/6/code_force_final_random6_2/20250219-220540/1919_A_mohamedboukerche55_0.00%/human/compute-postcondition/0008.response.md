Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(int(input())):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `s` is an input string from the user.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `int(input())` remains the same.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < int(input())` must hold true. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_0`. After the first iteration, `i` becomes `i_0 + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i_0 + 1` (since it was incremented by 1).
   - `int(input())` remains the same as it did at the start of the loop.
   - `s`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `s` is an input string from the user, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `i` is `i_0 + 1`, `int(input())` remains the same**.

However, since `i_0` is not explicitly provided, we can generalize the answer as follows:

**State: `s` is an input string from the user, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `i` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` remains the same**.
