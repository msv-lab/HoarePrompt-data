Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. It processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers (`t`, `a`, and `b`). The function's behavior and return values are not specified in the given information, but it is clear that it processes these integers in some manner and provides an output for each test case.
