Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    a = int(list(s.split())[0])
    b = int(list(s.split())[1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is an input string, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is an input string from the user, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `i` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` remains the same

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is an input string from the user, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `b` is now the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the new `s` on spaces, `i` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` remains the same




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
