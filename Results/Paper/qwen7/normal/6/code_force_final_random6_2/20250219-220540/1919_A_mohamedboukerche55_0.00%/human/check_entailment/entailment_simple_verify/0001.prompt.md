You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is equal to `int(input())`, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is equal to the integer value of the input, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is even. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the sum is odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. Both players take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key observation here is that the game essentially revolves around the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and checks its parity.
   - Based on the parity, it prints the correct winner ("bob" or "alice").
   - The logic is consistent with the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
