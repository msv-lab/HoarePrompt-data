Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times `(i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `dif`.**

The code `ans += dif` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif`. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we only know that it has been updated to its original value plus `dif`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
