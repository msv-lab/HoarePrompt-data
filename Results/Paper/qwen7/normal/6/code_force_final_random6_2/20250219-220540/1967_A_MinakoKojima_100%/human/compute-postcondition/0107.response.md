Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `k // (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. So, `ans` is updated to `k // 1`, which is simply `k`. Since `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)` and `i + 1` is 1, `k` is also less than `dif`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` as `k`.
