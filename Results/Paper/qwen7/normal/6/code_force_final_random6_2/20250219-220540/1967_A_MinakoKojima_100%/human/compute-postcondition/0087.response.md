Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means that the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variables directly involved in the loop head are the placeholder `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the integer input from `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`
   - `k` is `0`
   - `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`
   - `res` is `-n`
   - `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if the input integer is greater than 0. Therefore, the input integer must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, and `ans_list`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- The input integer should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, and the input integer must be decremented by 1.**

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head does not involve any specific variables but rather the input integer, the relevant adjustment is:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, and the input integer must be decremented by 1.**

But focusing strictly on the loop head variables, the answer would be:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.**
