Postcondition: `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `k` is either `-dif * 3` or 0, `ans` is either `ans + dif` or 0, and `res` is -4 or -3. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is set to `-dif * 3`, `ans` is incremented by `dif`, and `res` is set to -4. Otherwise, `k` remains 0, `ans` remains 0, and `res` remains -3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
