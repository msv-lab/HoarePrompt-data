Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()` and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. However, since the initial values of `i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged, these variables retain their original values. The new variable `a` is created and updated with the list of integers.
