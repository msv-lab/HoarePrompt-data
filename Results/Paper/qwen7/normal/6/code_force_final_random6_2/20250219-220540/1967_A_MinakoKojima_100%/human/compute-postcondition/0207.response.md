Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since the initial conditions and values of the variables (`i`, `dif`, `res`, `k`, `ans`) are not altered by the `break` statement itself, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these variables in their initial states and mentions that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
