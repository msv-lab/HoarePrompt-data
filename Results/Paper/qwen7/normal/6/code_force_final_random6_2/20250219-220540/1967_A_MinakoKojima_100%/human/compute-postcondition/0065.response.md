Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -3, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `k // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `k` is 0, and `i + 1` is 3, the expression `k // (i + 1)` evaluates to `0 // 3`, which is 0. Since `ans` was initially 0, adding 0 does not change its value. Therefore, `ans` remains 0. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `res`) remain unchanged.
