Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is `-2 * dif`, `ans` is `dif`, `res` is -2**.

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially -1, after executing this line, `res` becomes -2. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
