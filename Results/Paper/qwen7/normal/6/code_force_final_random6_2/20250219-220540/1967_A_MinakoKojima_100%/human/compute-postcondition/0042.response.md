Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is `-2 * dif`, `ans` is `dif`, and `res` is -1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from `k`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2, so `k -= dif * 2`. Since `k` was initially 0, the new value of `k` is `-2 * dif`. The values of `i`, `dif`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged.
