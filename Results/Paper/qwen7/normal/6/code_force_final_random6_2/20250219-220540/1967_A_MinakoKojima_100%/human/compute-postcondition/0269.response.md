The only objects in the loop head are variables `a` and `ans_list`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans_list`. For the loop to execute again, `ans_list` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element**
