Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -2, `ans` retains its original value, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` is being updated or `dif` is being calculated. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `i`, `dif`, `res`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged.
