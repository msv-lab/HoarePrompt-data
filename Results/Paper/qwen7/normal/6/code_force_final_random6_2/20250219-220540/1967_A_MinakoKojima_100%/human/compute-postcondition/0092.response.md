Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `a` is sorted list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `ans = a[0]` assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
