Based on the initial state provided, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. However, the value of `a` is not explicitly mentioned or derived from any formula or condition in the initial state. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state and no operation is performed on `ans_list` to extract or assign a value to `a`, we can only conclude that `a` is an element of `ans_list`.

Given the lack of specific information about the value of `a`, the most precise description we can provide is that `a` is an element of `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is an element of ans_list)**
