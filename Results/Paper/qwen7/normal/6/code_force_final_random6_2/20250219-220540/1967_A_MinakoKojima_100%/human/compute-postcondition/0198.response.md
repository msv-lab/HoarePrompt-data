Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1 + `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `k // (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding `k % (i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0, `k % (i + 1)` simplifies to `k % 1`, which is 0. Therefore, `res` remains `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
