Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is unchanged, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `res` was being updated based on the given conditions. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged. Additionally, since the `break` statement is executed, we know that the loop or conditional block is exited, and `k` is set to 0.
