Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is either `-2 * dif` or 0, `ans` is either `dif` or 0, `res` is either -2 or -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block has been exited. All the variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
