Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is adjusted based on the condition: if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is decreased by 1 and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`; otherwise, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is reset to 0, and `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `break` statement itself, the values of `i`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.
