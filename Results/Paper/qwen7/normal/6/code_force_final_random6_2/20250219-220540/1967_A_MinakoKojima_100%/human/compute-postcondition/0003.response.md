Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial values of `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
