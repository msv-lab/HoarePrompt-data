Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key objects here are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, but it doesn't affect the condition for the loop to execute.
   - `int(input())`: This is the expression that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a positive integer (since `range` requires a non-negative integer).

3. **Initial state**: The initial state given is that `ans_list` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. The state of `ans_list` being empty does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will determine the number of iterations in the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, input must return a positive integer**
