Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -3 + 0**

Explanation: The code `res += k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding `k % (i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. Since `k` is 0, `k % (i + 1)` is `0 % 3`, which is 0. Therefore, `res` is updated from -3 to -3 + 0, which remains -3. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
