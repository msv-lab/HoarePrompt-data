Output State: **`i` is 2; `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`; `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`; `res` is `res - 1`**

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `res` by 1.
