Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `dif`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `dif * (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `k -= dif * 1`, which means `k` is decreased by `dif`. The other variables (`res`, `k`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged. The updated state of `k` is expressed as `k` minus `dif`.
