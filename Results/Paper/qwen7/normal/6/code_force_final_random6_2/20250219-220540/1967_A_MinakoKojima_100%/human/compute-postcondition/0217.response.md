Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is `ans + (a[2] - a[1])`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif`, which is `a[2] - a[1]`. The values of `i` and `dif` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `ans` is the sum of its original value and `a[2] - a[1]`.
