Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the last integer entered by the user, `word` is either "zz", "aay", or "aaa", and `i` is 99 (since the loop runs `int(input())` times, and we assume the user inputs a value that allows the loop to run up to its maximum of 100 iterations).**

In this final state, the variable `t` remains within its initial bounds, `n` holds the value of the last input provided by the user, and `word` will be one of the three possible strings ("zz", "aay", or "aaa") based on the value of `n`. The loop counter `i` reaches its maximum value of 99, assuming the user inputs a value that allows the loop to run the full 100 iterations.
