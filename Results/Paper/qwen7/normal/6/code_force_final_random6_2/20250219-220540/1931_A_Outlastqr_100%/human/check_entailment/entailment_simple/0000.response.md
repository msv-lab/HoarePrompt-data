### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is verified by the loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program handles different ranges of `n` values to construct the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For `n > 52`, it constructs a word starting with the character at position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - For `27 < n <= 52`, it constructs a word starting with 'a', the character at position `n - 28`, and 'z'.
   - For `n == 27`, it directly sets the word to "aay".
   - For `n <= 26`, it constructs a word starting with 'aa' and the character at position `n - 3`.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed word is printed for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 27 and less than 27.
   - It ensures that the constructed words are the lexicographically smallest possible for each range of `n`.

5. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it correctly computes and prints the word based on the value of `n`.

Given the above points, the program logic and handling of all test cases appear to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
