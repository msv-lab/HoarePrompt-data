Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

The code initializes the `alphabet` variable with the lowercase English letters, but it does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
