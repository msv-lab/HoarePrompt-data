You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the last integer entered by the user, `word` is either "zz", "aay", or "aaa", and `i` is 99 (since the loop runs `int(input())` times, and we assume the user inputs a value that allows the loop to run up to its maximum of 100 iterations).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and generates a specific string based on the value of \( n \). If \( n \) is greater than 52, it appends "zz" to a string formed from the 53rd character of the alphabet. If \( n \) is between 28 and 52, it appends the 29th character of the alphabet followed by "z". If \( n \) is 27, it sets the string to "aay". If \( n \) is between 3 and 26, it appends "aa" followed by the \( n \)-th character of the alphabet. The function prints the generated string for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to get the list of lowercase English letters.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `n`.
   - Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - If `n > 52`: 
     - The formula `n - 53` gives the position of the third letter in the alphabet. The first two letters are set to 'z'.
   - If `n > 27`:
     - The formula `n - 28` gives the position of the second letter in the alphabet. The first letter is set to 'a', and the third letter is set to 'z'.
   - If `n == 27`:
     - A special case where the word is "aay".
   - Otherwise:
     - The formula `n - 3` gives the position of the third letter in the alphabet. The first two letters are set to 'a'.

### Testing the Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1: \( n = 24 \)**
  - According to the logic:
    - Since \( 24 \leq 27 \), we use the "otherwise" block.
    - \( 24 - 3 = 21 \), so the third letter is 'u'.
    - The word is "aaa".
  - However, the expected output is "aav". This suggests a mistake in the logic.

- **Test Case 2: \( n = 70 \)**
  - According to the logic:
    - Since \( 70 > 52 \), we use the first block.
    - \( 70 - 53 = 17 \), so the third letter is 'r'.
    - The word is "zzr".
  - However, the expected output is "rzz". This suggests a mistake in the logic.

- **Test Case 3: \( n = 3 \)**
  - According to the logic:
    - Since \( 3 \leq 27 \), we use the "otherwise" block.
    - \( 3 - 3 = 0 \), which is invalid. This should handle the case where `n` is less than 3.
  - The expected output is "aaa". This suggests a mistake in the logic.

- **Test Case 4: \( n = 55 \)**
  - According to the logic:
    - Since \( 55 > 52 \), we use the first block.
    - \( 55 - 53 = 2 \), so the third letter is 'b'.
    - The word is "zzb".
  - However, the expected output is "czz". This suggests a mistake in the logic.

- **Test Case 5: \( n = 48 \)**
  - According to the logic:
    - Since \( 48 > 27 \), we use the second block.
    - \( 48 - 28 = 20 \), so the second letter is 't'.
    - The word is "azz".
  - However, the expected output is "auz". This suggests a mistake in the logic.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and produces incorrect outputs for some test cases. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
