Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, for the test case `n = 27`, the program outputs `"aay"`. However, according to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded with a sum of 27 is `"aaa"`. The program fails to generate `"aaa"` for this input, which means it does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
