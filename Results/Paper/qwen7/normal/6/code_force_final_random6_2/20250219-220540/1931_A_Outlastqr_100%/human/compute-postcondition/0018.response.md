Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is assigned the value of the integer entered by the user, and `word` is the string 'aaa', assuming `alphabet[n - 3]` is 'a'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'aa' followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 3` to the `word` string. Given that `n` is less than 27, the character at index `n - 3` would be 'a', making the updated `word` string 'aaa'. All other variables remain unchanged.
