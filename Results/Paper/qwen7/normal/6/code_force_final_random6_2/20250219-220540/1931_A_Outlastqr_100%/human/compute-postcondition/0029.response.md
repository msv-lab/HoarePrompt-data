Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz', `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the existing value of `word`. The value of `t`, `i`, and the condition for `word` remain unchanged.
