Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `alphabet` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`. Therefore, `i` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not known initially but will be determined by user input during the loop execution. However, for the loop to start, `int(input())` must be a valid integer within a reasonable range (since `t` is between 1 and 100, it is reasonable to assume `int(input())` will be within this range).

5. **Ensure the loop can start**:
   - The loop will start if `int(input())` is a valid integer and within the range that can be reasonably expected based on the given constraints.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `t`, `n`, and the expectation that `int(input())` will be a valid integer within a reasonable range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).
- `int(input())` must be a valid integer and within a reasonable range (considering `t` and `n`).

Therefore, the final state is:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\), `int(input())` must be a valid integer and within a reasonable range**.
