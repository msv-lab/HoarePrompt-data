Output State: **`ldb` must contain at least one element, `k - sz` remains unchanged, and `sz` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2. The conditions that `ldb` must contain at least one element and `k - sz` remains unchanged are still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes `sz` being increased by 2.
