Based on the initial state provided, we know that `ldb` contains at least one element, but we do not have any explicit value for `elem`. Similarly, `k - sz` remains unchanged, but again, no explicit value is given for `elem`. Since the code snippet only references `elem` and uses it twice in the print statement, and there is no additional context to determine the specific value of `elem`, we can only describe it in terms of its usage.

Given this, the print statement will output `elem` followed by another `elem`, with a space in between due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **elem elem**
