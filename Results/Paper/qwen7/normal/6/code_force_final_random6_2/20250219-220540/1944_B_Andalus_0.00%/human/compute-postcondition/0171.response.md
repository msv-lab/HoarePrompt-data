Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `ldb` now contains `[lft[i]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 1, `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends `lft[1]` (which is equal to `lft[0]` according to the precondition) to `ldb`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
