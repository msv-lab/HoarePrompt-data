Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `lft` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (first n elements of `lst`), `rgt` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (remaining elements of `lst` starting from index n), `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `rgt` is now sorted, while all other variables retain their initial states.
