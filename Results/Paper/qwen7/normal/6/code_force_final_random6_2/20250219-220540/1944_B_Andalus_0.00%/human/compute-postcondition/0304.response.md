Output State: **`sz` is 7, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the new `elem`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `k`, or `sng`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently in. Since no other operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged.
