Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sz` is 10
   - `k` is 3
   - `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`
   - `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`
   - `lst` is a list of integers
   - `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
   - `ldb` is an empty list
   - `rdb` is an empty list
   - `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`
   - `i` is 3

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - At each iteration, the condition `if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]` is checked.
   - If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, then `sng` is updated to contain `lft[i]`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - The loop will check if `i` (which is now 4) is within the range `[1, n)`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update the value of `i` to 4.
   - All other variables remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

7. **Final State:**
   - `sz` is 10
   - `k` is 3
   - `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`
   - `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`
   - `lst` is a list of integers
   - `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
   - `ldb` is an empty list
   - `rdb` is an empty list
   - `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`
   - `i` is 4

**State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, `i` is 4**
