Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` is empty.
- `sng` contains at least one element.
- If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

Since `sng` contains at least one element, `elem` must be one of the elements in `sng`. However, the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it as an element from `sng`.

Output: **an element from sng**
