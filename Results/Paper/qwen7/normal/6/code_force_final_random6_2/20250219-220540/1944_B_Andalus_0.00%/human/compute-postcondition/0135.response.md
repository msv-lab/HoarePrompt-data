Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 9, `sng` must contain at least two elements.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `rdb` will be empty because it loses at least one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. The value of `sz` increases by 2 for each iteration as long as `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Since the loop executes 3 times and `sz` starts at 5, it will increase to 7 after the first two iterations and then to 9 after the third iteration. The loop breaks after the third iteration because `sz` reaches 9 and `k` is no longer able to accommodate the increment by 2 without violating the condition `k - sz >= 2`. Therefore, `ldb` remains empty, and `sng` must still contain at least two elements as it was initially required.
