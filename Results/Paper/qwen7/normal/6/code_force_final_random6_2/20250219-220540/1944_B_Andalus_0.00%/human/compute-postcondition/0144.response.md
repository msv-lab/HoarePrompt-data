Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `elem` which iterates over the elements in `sng`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `sng`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ldb` is empty.
   - `rdb` is empty.
   - `sz` is 10.
   - `sng` contains at least 3 elements.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `sng` contains at least 3 elements, and the loop is iterating over each element in `sng`, at the end of the previous iteration, `sng` must have had at least one element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `ldb` remains empty.
   - `rdb` remains empty.
   - `sz` remains 10.
   - `sng` must now contain at least 2 elements (since one element was processed in the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 10, `sng` contains at least 2 elements**
