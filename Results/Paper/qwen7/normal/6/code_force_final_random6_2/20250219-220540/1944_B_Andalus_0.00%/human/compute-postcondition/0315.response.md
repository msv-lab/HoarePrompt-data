Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is a slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `lst`. The values of `sz`, `k`, `sng`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
