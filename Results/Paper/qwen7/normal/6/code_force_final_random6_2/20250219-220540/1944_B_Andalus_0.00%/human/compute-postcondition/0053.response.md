Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is 0.**

Explanation: The loop has finished executing all its iterations, setting `i` to `n`. The list `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element. The variable `sz` is initialized to 0 and does not get updated during the loop, so it remains 0.
