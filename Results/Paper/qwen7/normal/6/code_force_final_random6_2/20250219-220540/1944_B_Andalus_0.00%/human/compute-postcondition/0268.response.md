Given the initial state:
- `sz` is 3
- `k` is 5
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable
- The value of `k` is at least 2 more than `sz`

From the precondition, we know:
- `sz` is 3
- `k` is 5, which satisfies the condition that `k` is at least 2 more than `sz` (since 5 is indeed 2 more than 3)

However, the code snippet does not reference `sz` or `k` directly. Instead, it references `elem`, which is not defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Since `elem` is not defined, the print statement will raise a NameError if executed in Python. However, based on the format requested, we need to describe the output in terms of what would be printed if `elem` were defined.

Output: **elem elem**
