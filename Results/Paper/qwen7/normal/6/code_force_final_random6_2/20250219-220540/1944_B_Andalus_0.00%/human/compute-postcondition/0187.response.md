Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is greater than `1`
   - `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable)
   - If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]`.
   - Otherwise, `sng` contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `n` to satisfy the condition `i < n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.
   - The conditions involving `lft[i]` and its neighbors (`lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]`) need to be checked for the new value of `i`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` is still greater than `1`
   - The conditions involving `lft[i]` and its neighbors need to be checked for `i = n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than `1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable)**.
