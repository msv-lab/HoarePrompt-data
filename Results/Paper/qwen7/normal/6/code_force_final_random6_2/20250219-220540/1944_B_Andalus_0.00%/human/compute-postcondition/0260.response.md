Output State: **`sz` is 3, `k` is 3**

The initial state indicates that the loop has executed 3 times and `sz` is still 3, implying that `k` is also 3. The given code snippet simply reassigns `sz` to 0, which contradicts the initial state. However, since the loop condition is that it continues until `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, and `sz` was already 3, the loop would have stopped before this line of code was executed. Therefore, the values of `sz` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial values.
