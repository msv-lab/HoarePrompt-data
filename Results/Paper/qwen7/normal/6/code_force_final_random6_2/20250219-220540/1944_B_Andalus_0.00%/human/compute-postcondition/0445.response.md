Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, and `rdb` is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, there are two possible scenarios based on the given conditions:

1. If the loop did not break early (i.e., `sz < k`), the loop would continue to run until it either prints pairs of elements from `rdb` or reaches the condition where `sz` no longer satisfies `k - sz >= 2`. This would happen when `sz` reaches a value where `k - sz` is less than 2, causing the loop to terminate.

2. Given that the loop outputs pairs of elements and increments `sz` by 2 each time, the final value of `sz` will be either 0 (if no elements were printed) or 2 (if at least one pair of elements was printed). Since the loop breaks when `sz >= k` or when `k - sz < 2`, the only way for the loop to finish executing without printing any more elements is if `rdb` is empty or if `sz` reaches a value where further printing is not allowed. Thus, by the end of all iterations, `rdb` must be empty.
