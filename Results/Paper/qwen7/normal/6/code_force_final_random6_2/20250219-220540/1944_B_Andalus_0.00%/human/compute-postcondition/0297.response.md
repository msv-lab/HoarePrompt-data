Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. This means the loop is iterating over each element in the list `sng`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 6 (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `k` is 3 (this variable is not involved in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is `elem`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `sng`. After the first iteration, `elem` would be the first element of the list `sng`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `sng`, after the first iteration, `elem` will be the second element in the list `sng`.
   - The list `sng` will now have one less element because the first element has been processed.

Given these points, let's update the state for the next iteration:

- `sz` remains 6.
- `k` remains 3.
- `sng` is still a non-empty list but now has one less element, and the first element in the list is the original `elem` (which was the first element before the first iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sz` is 6, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the original `elem`**.
