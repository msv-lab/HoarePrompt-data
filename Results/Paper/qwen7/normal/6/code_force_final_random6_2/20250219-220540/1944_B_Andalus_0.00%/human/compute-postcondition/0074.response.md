Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is `sz + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2, but its exact new value is not specified since the initial value of `sz` was not given. The `break` statement does not change the value of `ldb`, but it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
