Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is `2 * min(3, k)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k` and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. After the loop executes 3 times, `sz` becomes `6` if `k` is greater than or equal to 6. If `k` is less than 6, the loop will break before the third iteration, and `sz` will be `2 * k`. Since the loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k` or more, `ldb` will be exhausted, making it empty. The value of `rdb` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, `sng` must contain at least one element, and `k - sz` must be at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 2`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 3`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
