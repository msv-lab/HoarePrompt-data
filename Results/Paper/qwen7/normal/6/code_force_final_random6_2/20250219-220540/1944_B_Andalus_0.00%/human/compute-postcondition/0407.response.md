Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Since the initial condition was that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1, after incrementing by 1, `sz` becomes an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 2. The condition that `sng` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
