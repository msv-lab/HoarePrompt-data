Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `ldb` is empty.
   - `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element. This means `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is repeated consecutively.
   - `sz` is equal to `k + 2`. Here, `sz` is a fixed value determined by adding 2 to `k`.
   - `sng` must contain at least one element. Let's denote the single element in `sng` as `sng[0]`.
   - `elem` is the second element of `sng`. Since `sng` has only one element, this implies there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the description because `sng` cannot have a second element if it only contains one. However, based on the given information, we'll assume `elem` is the same as the single element in `sng`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```
   The `print` statement outputs `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '`).

Given the initial state, the key variable here is `elem`, which is described as the second element of `sng`. Since `sng` contains only one element, `elem` must be that single element.

Therefore, the output will be the single element in `sng`.

Output: **[sng[0]]**
