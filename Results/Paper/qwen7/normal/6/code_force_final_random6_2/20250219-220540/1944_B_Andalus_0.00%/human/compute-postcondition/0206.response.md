Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be at least 2; `rdb` has appended `rgt[3]`.**

The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[3]` to the list `rdb`. Since `i` is 3, `rgt[3]` is appended to `rdb`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
