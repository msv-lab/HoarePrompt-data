Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 3 or 5.
- `k` is 3.
- `rdb` is not empty.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Given the information, we need to determine the value of `elem`. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and there's no context about how it gets assigned, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we know that `elem` must be an element from `rdb` because `rdb` is not empty and it is likely being iterated over in some loop (though the loop itself is not shown).

Therefore, the print statement will output `elem` twice, separated by a space, but the exact value of `elem` cannot be determined without more context.

Output: **elem elem**
