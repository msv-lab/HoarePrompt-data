Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element, `sz` is 5, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and the value of `k` is such that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it 5. The other variables (`ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
