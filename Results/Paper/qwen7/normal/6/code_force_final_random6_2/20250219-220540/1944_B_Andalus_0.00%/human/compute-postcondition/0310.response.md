Output State: `sz` is 9, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, and the first three elements in the list are the `elem`s printed during each iteration of the loop.

This means that the loop continues to execute as long as `sz` (which starts at 5 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than `k` (which is 3). Since the loop breaks when `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, and given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `sz` is 9. At this point, `sz` will be equal to 9, which is greater than or equal to `k`, causing the loop to break. Therefore, the loop will execute a total of 4 times (from `sz` = 5 to `sz` = 9), printing 4 elements from the list `sng`. The list `sng` must have at least 4 elements to allow the loop to complete its iterations.
