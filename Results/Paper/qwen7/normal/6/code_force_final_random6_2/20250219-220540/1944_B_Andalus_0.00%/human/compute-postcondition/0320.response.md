Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `rgt` is a list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`**.

The code `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft`, which is assumed to be the list `lst` up to index `n`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `lst`, the output state reflects that `lft` is now sorted, while all other variables remain unchanged.
