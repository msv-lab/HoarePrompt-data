Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head.
   - The loop variable `n` is used as the upper bound for the range function.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1`.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, `i` should start at `1` and increment until it reaches `n-1`.
   - `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to run at least once.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute and reach its final condition where `i` equals `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
