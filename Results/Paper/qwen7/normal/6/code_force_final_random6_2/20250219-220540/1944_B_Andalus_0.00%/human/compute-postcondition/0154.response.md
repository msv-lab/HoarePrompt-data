Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` is empty.
- `sz` is 11.
- `sng` contains at least 1 element.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `sng` contains at least one element, it implies that `elem` could be any element from `sng`. But without more specific information about `elem`, we can only say that it is an element from `sng`.

Given this, the output will be the value of `elem` from `sng`, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function.

Output: **[elem from sng] **
