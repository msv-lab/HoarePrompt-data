Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` must contain at least one element.
- The size of `ldb` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

From these conditions, we can infer the following:

1. Since `sz` is the size of `ldb` and it is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, this implies that `sz` is at least 2 more than `k`. Therefore, `sz` must be at least `k + 2`.

2. Given that `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is at least `k + 2`, `ldb` must have at least `k + 2` elements.

However, the specific values of `elem` are not provided in the initial state. The `print` statement simply prints `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its role in the print statement.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is an element from the list `ldb`)
