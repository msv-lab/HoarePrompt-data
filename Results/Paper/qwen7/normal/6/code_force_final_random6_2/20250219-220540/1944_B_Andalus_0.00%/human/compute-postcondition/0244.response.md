Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `k` is defined but its value is not explicitly given.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Given that `sz` is 0 and the condition to break out of the loop or if statement is `if sz >= k`, since `sz` is 0, this condition will not be met (0 is not greater than or equal to any positive value of `k`). Therefore, there is no information about `elem` from the given conditions.

Since `elem` is not defined or provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Thus, the print statement will simply output `elem` with a space at the end (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **elem**
