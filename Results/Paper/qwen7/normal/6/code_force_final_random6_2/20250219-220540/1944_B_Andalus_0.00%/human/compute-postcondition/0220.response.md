Postcondition: `ldb` must contain at least one element. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the size of `ldb` (denoted as `sz`) is now greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `k - sz` is now less than or equal to -2. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is met.
