Output State: **`sz` is 15, `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, and `sng` is empty.**

Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as `sz` (which starts at 5 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than `k`. Given that `k` is at least 13 (as determined from the first iteration's output state), the loop will continue to run until `sz` reaches 15. This means the loop will execute a total of 11 times (from `sz` = 5 to `sz` = 15). During these iterations, all elements in `sng` will be printed out, and since `sng` initially contains at least 11 elements (to allow the loop to run 11 times), it will be emptied after the loop completes. Both `ldb` and `rdb` remain empty throughout the loop as they do not gain any elements.
