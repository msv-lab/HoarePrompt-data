Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sz` is 9
   - `k` is 3
   - `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements (since it needs to provide 4 elements for the loop to complete its iterations)

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `sz` is less than `k`.
   - Given `k` is 3, the loop will run as long as `sz` is less than 3.
   - However, since `sz` starts at 9 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will actually run for 4 iterations (from `sz` = 9 to `sz` = 12).

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is 9.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sz` must be incremented to 10.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `sz`.
   - After the next iteration, `sz` will be incremented by 1, making it 10.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements**.
