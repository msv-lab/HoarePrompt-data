Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is incremented by 2 if the condition `k - sz >= 2` is true. If the condition `sz >= k` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `k - sz >= 2` is false, `sz` remains unchanged.
