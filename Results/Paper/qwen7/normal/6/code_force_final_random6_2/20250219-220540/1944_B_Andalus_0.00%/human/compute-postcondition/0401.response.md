Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, making it one more than its original value which was greater than or equal to `k`. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains the same since the code does not affect that logic.
