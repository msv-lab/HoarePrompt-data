Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is 2, and `rdb` is a list containing the values `[rgt[1], rgt[2], rgt[3]]`. If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, the values in `rdb` remain unchanged. If `rgt[3]` is not equal to `rgt[2]`, the values in `rdb` also remain unchanged since there is no modification in the else part.
