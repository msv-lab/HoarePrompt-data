Output State: The loop will have executed for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. After all iterations, `ldb` will contain all elements from `lft` that are equal to their preceding element (`lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`), and `sng` will contain all other elements from `lft` that do not meet the condition for `ldb`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` remains an empty list, `sz` remains 13, `n` remains its original input value, `k` remains its original input value, `lst` remains its original list of integers, `lft` remains a list of the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, and `rgt` remains a list of the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n` sorted in ascending order, and `sng` will contain the elements that did not meet the condition for `ldb`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ldb` will hold consecutive duplicates from the beginning of `lft`, and `sng` will hold the rest of the elements from `lft`.
