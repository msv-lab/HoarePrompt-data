Output State: **`sz` is either 1 or 3, `rdb` is empty, `sng` contains at least one element, and if the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1. Given that `sz` was either 0 or 2 initially, after executing `sz += 1`, `sz` will now be either 1 or 3. The states of `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding breaking out of the loop or if statement also remains the same.
