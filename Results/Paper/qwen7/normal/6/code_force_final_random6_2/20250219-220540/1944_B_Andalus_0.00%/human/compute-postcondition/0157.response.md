Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 12, `sng` contains at least 1 element.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `rdb` will be empty because it loses at least one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. The value of `sz` increases by 1 in each iteration as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `sz` reached 12. The loop breaks when `sz` becomes 12, meaning `k` must be at least 13 for the loop to run fully. Therefore, `ldb` remains empty as it was not involved in any operations within the loop. The condition `sng` must contain at least two elements initially ensures there are enough elements for the loop to iterate at least three times, but after the third iteration, it only needs to contain at least one element to satisfy the loop's termination condition.
