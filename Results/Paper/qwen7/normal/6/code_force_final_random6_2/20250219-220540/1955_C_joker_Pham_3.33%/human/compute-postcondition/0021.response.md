Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\) reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, and the current value of `a[l]` is now less than the current value of `a[r]` by `a[l]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` subtracts the value of `a[l]` from `a[r]`. Given that initially `a[l]` was less than or equal to `a[r]`, after executing the code, `a[r]` will be less than `a[r]` by the value of `a[l]`, making `a[l]` now less than `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
