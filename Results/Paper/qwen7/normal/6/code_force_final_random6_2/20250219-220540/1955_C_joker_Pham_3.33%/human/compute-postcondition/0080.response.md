Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` must be `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3 or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If the condition `k >= a[r]` is true, then `sunks` is either 3 or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the else case does not change the variables' states, and thus the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
