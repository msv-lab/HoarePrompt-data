Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\) reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is equal to 1, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Given the initial state where `sunks` is either 0 or 1, after executing this line, `sunks` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
