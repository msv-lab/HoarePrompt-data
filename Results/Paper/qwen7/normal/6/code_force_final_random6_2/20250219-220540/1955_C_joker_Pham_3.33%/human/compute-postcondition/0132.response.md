Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2]\) or \(-2 * a[n]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `r`, `r` is `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 5, 6, 7, 7, or 8, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. Since `sunks` could have been 4, 5, 6, 6, or 7 initially, after incrementing by 1, it will now be 5, 6, 7, 7, or 8 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
