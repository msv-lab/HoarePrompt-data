Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 1, the current value of `a[l]` is equal to \(\frac{k + 1}{2}\), and `k` is less than \(a[l] \times 2\)**.

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. Initially, `sunks` was either 0 or 1. After incrementing, `sunks` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
