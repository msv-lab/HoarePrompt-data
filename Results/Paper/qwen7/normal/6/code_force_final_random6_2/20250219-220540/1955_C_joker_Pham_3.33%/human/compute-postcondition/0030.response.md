Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\) reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r - 1` and is increased by 1, `sunks` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values or the conditions given in the initial state. It only indicates that the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their original values except for `l`, which is increased by 1.
