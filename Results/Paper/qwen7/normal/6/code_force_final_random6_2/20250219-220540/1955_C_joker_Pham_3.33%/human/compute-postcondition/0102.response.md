Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2]\) or \(-2 * a[n]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, or 6, `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`**.

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. Since `sunks` could initially be 3, 4, 5, or 6, after incrementing by 1, it will now be 4, 5, or 6 (it cannot be 3 anymore). All other variables remain unchanged.
