Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\) reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `sunks` is equal to 2, and the current value of `a[r-1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their original conditions and values as specified in the initial state.
