Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is `-2 * a[n]`, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` is now `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 5 or 6, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Given that `sunks` was either 4 or 5, after incrementing, it becomes either 5 or 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
