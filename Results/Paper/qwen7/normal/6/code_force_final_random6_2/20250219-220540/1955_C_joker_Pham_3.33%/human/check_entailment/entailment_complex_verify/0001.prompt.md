You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 3` or `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `t` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged, being a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\). The variable `k` takes on a specific form based on the operations performed within the loop, which results in a negative value involving multiples of elements from the list `a`. The variable `a` itself remains a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with a length of `n`. The indices `l` and `r` are set to `n - 3` or `n - 1` and `n - 4` or `n - 3`, respectively, indicating the positions in the list `a` that were last processed. Finally, the variable `sunks` indicates the total number of successful operations (or "sunks") performed during the loop, which ranges between 4 and 10 inclusive, depending on the exact sequence of operations and the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns a value for `sunks` which is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `a` (a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`). It processes the list `a` by performing operations based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` within a while loop. The function counts the number of successful operations (referred to as `sunks`) and returns this count, which can be one of the values 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and the list `a` as inputs.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - It then checks if `l` and `r` are the same. If so, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the ship at position `r`. If true, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks the loop.
   - If `l` and `r` are different, it checks which ship has lower durability (`a[l]` or `a[r]`).
     - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it performs the following steps:
       - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the ship at position `l`. If true, it subtracts twice the durability from `k`, decreases the durability of the ship at position `r` by the durability of the ship at position `l`, and updates the `sunks` counter and positions accordingly.
       - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks the loop.
       - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
     - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it performs similar steps but with positions `l` and `r` swapped.

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program using one of the examples provided:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 5 1 2 4 3`
- Expected Output: `2`

**Steps:**
1. Initial state: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. After 1st attack: `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (sunk 1st ship, `sunks = 1`)
3. After 2nd attack: `[0, 2, 3, 2]` (sunk last ship, `sunks = 2`)
4. After 3rd attack: `[1, 2, 2, 1]` (reduced durability of 2nd and 4th ships, `sunks = 2`)
5. After 4th attack: `[1, 1, 1, 0]` (reduced durability of 2nd ship, `sunks = 2`)
6. After 5th attack: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (sunk 1st ship, `sunks = 3`)

The program correctly outputs `2` sunk ships.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
