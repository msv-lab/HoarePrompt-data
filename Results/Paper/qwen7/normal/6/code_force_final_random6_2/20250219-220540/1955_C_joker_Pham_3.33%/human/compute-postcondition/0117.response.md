Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2]\) or \(-2 * a[n]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `r`, `r` is `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, or 7, and if `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
