Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list `a` of ship durabilities. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks until either `k` attacks are exhausted or all ships sink.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, reducing their durability and counting the number of sunk ships (`sunks`).
   - The conditions for checking if a ship's durability reaches zero and the subsequent decrement of `k` are correctly implemented.
   - The loop terminates when `k` becomes zero or all ships have sunk.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l` and `r` converge to the same ship.
   - It also correctly handles scenarios where the durability of the first and last ships are different and the Kraken attacks them accordingly.
   - The function correctly breaks the loop when `k` is insufficient to sink any more ships.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the correct number of sunk ships, which is calculated based on the number of successful attacks performed.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code accurately simulates the described behavior and correctly calculates the number of sunk ships for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
