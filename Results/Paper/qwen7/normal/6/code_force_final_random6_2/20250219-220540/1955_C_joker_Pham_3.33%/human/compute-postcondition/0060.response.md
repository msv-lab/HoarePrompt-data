Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is greater than or equal to \(a[r] \times 2 - a[r] \times 2\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 2, 3, or 4 (since `sunks` was originally 1 and was incremented by 1), and the current value of `a[r]` is now less than the current value of `a[l]` by the amount of `a[r]`. Additionally, `a[l]` is currently 0.**

In this output state, `sunks` has been incremented by 1, making its value either 2, 3, or 4 depending on its original value before the increment. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
