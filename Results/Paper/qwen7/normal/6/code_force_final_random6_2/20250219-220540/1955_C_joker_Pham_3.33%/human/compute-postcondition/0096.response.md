Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either `-2 * a[n]` or 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is either `n + 1` or `n`, `r` is either `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3, 4, 5, or 6, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. If the condition `a[l] <= a[r]` is true, `k` becomes either `-2 * a[n]` or 0, and `l` and `r` take specific values depending on the condition. If the condition is false, the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were before the if-else block, and `sunks` remains unchanged, while still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
