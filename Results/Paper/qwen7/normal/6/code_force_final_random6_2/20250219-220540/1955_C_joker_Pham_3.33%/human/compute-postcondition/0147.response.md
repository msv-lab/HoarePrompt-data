Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 4` or `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and `l` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` is not zero.**
