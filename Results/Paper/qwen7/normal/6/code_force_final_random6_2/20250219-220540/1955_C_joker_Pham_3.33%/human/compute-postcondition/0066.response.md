Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 1, the current value of `a[r]` is equal to \((k + 1) / 2\)**.

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Initially, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. After incrementing, `sunks` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
