Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
