The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is greater than or equal to \(a[r] \times 2 - a[r] \times 2\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 2, 3, or 4, and the current value of `a[r]` is now less than the current value of `a[l]` by the amount of `a[r]`, with `a[l]` being 0.**
