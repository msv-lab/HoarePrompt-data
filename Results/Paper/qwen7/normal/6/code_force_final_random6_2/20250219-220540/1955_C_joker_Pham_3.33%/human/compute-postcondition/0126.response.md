Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `r`, `r` is `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 5, 6, 7, 7, or 8, `a[n-3]` is decreased by `a[n-1]`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1. Since `sunks` could initially be 4, 5, 6, 6, or 7, after incrementing, it will now be 5, 6, 7, 7, or 8 respectively.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
