Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is `-2 * a[n]`, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` must be `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3 or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by twice the value of `a[l]`. Since `l` is equal to `n`, the value of `k` becomes `-2 * a[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
