Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 3` or `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then no changes occur due to the `continue` statement. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is updated to one of 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, or 10. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sunks` and `a` due to the `break` statement.**
