Output State: **`D` contains all zeros, `tot` is zero, `fnd` is incremented by 1 for every iteration where `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, `C` contains counts of elements in `aa[m:]` that were never in `bb` and their count in `C` is incremented by the number of such elements, `E` contains counts of elements in `aa[:n-m]` that were never in `bb` and their count in `E` is decremented by the number of such elements, `nabors` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `input().split()`. These values are then converted to integers using a list comprehension and assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This does not affect the values of `D`, `tot`, `fnd`, `C`, `E`, or `nabors` directly, but it does introduce `n`, `m`, and `k` into the program's state. The initial conditions for `D`, `tot`, `fnd`, `C`, `E`, and `nabors` remain unchanged except for `nabors` which is decreased by 1 due to the execution of the line of code.
