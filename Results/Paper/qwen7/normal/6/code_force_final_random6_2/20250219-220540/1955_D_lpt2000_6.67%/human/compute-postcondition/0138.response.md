Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; If `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2; Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. The conditions related to `fnd`, `C[in_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this line of code. The condition for incrementing `fnd` based on whether `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` also remains the same.
