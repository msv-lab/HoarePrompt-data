Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, but `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0 initially, and `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
