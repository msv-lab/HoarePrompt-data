Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `aa`. The initial conditions for `nabors`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
