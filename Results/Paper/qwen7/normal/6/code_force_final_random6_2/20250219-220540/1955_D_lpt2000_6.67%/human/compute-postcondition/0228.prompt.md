Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is decremented by 1; `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements and their counts in the first `m` elements of `aa` and the list `bb`; `aa` is a list of integers from the input split; `bb` is a list of integers from the input split; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the list `bb`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. The values of `tot`, `k`, `C[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `k` remain as per the initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1; `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1; `C[in_aa]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged; `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1; `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` (which is the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
