Postcondition: `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`, and its value is either decreased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] > 0`), increased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] <= 0`), or decreased by 1 (if `D[out_aa] > 0`). `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`. Regardless of the if condition, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa] > 0` is true, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 in the if part, while `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 in the else part.
