Postcondition: **`tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m+1:]`, and `aa[:n - m - 1]`. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, if `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Depending on the value of `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]`, either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. It covers all possible outcomes of the if-else statement, ensuring that the relationships between the variables are clearly described.
