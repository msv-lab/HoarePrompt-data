Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_bb = Counter(bb)` creates a new Counter object named `cnt_bb` that counts the frequency of each element in the list `bb`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
