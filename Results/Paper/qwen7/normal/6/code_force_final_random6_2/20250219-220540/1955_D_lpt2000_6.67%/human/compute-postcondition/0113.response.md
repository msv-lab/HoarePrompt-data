Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 initially, then `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
