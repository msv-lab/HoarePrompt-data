Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Initialization and Counters**: The initial counters `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` are only updated once, which means they do not account for changes in the sliding window. This leads to incorrect results as the sliding window moves through the array `aa`.

2. **Updating Counters**: The logic for updating the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the decrement and increment operations are not correctly handling the sliding window mechanism.

3. **Condition Checking**: The condition `fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0` should be applied after the correct updates to the counters have been made for the current window.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Initialize counters for the first window
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
        
        # Sliding window approach
        for i in range(m, n):
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            in_aa = aa[i]
            
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                    C[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            
            tot = sum(D.values())
            fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the sliding window and updates the counters correctly for each position in the array `aa`.
