Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000 - 2, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be one less than the maximum possible value (10000), indicating the number of times the loop ran. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input received. The list `numbers` will contain exactly `t` elements, each being an integer input provided during the loop's execution.
