Output State: **`i` is 12; `word` is '12'; `last` is 2; `remainder` is 1; `sum_total` is `values[12] + values[11]`; `sum_values[12]` is `values[12] + values[11]`**

Explanation: The code updates `sum_values[i]` to be equal to `sum_total`. Given that `i` is 12, `sum_values[12]` is set to `values[12] + values[11]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
