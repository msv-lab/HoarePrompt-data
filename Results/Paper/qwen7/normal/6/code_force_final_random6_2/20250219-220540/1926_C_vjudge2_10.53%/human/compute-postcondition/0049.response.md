Output State: **`i` is 12; `word` is '12'; `last` is 2; `remainder` is 1; `sum_total` is `values[12] + values[11]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `sum_total` as the sum of `values[i]` (which is `values[12]`) and `sum_values[i - 1]` (which is `sum_values[11]`). Since `values[i]` is defined as `values[last] + values[remainder]`, substituting the given values, `values[12]` is `values[2] + values[1]`. However, since the exact values of `values[2]` and `values[1]` are not provided, we express `sum_total` as `values[12] + sum_values[11]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
