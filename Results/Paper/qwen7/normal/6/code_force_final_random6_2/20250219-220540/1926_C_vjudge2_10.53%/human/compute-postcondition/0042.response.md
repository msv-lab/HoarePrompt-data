Output State: **`i` is 11; `word` is '11'; `remainder` is 1; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`; `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `sum_total` by adding `values[i]` and `sum_values[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 11, `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`, and `i - 1` is 10, the value of `sum_total` is `values[last] + values[remainder] + sum_values[10]`. The other variables (`i`, `word`, `remainder`, and `values[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
