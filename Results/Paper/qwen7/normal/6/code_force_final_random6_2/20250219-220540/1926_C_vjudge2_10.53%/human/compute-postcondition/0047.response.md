Output State: **`i` is 12; `word` is '12'; `last` is 2; `remainder` is 1**

Explanation: The code `remainder = int(word[:-1])` takes the substring of `word` excluding the last character (which is '2') and converts it to an integer. Since `word` is '12', `word[:-1]` results in '1', and `int('1')` equals 1. Therefore, `remainder` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i` and `last` remain unchanged.
