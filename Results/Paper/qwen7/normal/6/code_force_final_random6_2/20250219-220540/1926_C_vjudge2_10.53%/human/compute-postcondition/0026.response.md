Output State: **`values[i]` is equal to `i`; `total` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The code `total += i` increments the value of `total` by `i`. Since `values[i]` is equal to `i`, the value of `total` is updated accordingly. The state of `values[i]` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly, only updates `total`.
