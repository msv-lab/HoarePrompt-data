Output State: **i is 19; word is '19'; last is 9; remainder is 1; values[19] is values[9] + values[1]; sum_total is values[19] + sum_values[18]; sum_values[19] is sum_total.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i=10` to `i=19` (inclusive), as `n` is not specified but we can infer it based on the given information. After 10 iterations (from `i=10` to `i=19`), the final value of `i` will be 19. At this point, `word` will be '19', `last` will be 9, and `remainder` will be 1. The value of `values[19]` will be calculated as `values[9] + values[1]`, and `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[19]` and `sum_values[18]`. Finally, `sum_values[19]` will be updated to this sum_total.
