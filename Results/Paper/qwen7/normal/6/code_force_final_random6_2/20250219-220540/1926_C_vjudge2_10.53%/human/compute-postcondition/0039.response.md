Output State: **`i` is 11; `word` is '11'; `last` is 1**

Explanation: The code `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` takes the last character of the string `word` (which is '1') and converts it to an integer, resulting in `last` being set to 1. The values of `i` and `word` remain unchanged from their initial states.
