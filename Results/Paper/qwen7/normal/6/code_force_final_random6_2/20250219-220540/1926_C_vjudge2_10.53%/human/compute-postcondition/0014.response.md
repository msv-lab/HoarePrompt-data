Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 9999, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_values` as a list of zeros with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `numbers`, or `values`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `sum_values` is created and initialized to a list of zeros with the specified length.
