Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing the element `n`.**

The code appends the value of `n` to the list `numbers`. Since `t` and `n` remain unchanged, they retain their initial values. The list `numbers` now contains the element `n`.
