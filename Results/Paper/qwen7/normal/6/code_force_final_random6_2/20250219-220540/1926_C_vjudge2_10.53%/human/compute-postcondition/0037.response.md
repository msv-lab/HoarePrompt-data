Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(10, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 10
   - `word` is '10'
   - `remainder` is 1
   - `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`
   - `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`
   - `sum_values[i]` is `sum_total`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `10` to `n + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 10, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 11.
   - The value of `n` must be such that `i` (which is now 11) is still within the range `10` to `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 11.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` is updated to 11.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 11.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11**
