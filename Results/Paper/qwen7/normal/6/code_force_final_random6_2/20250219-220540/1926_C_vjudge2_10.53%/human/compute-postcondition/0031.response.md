Output State: **`i` is 10; `word` is '10'**

Explanation: The variable `word` is assigned the value of `i` converted to a string. Since `i` is 10, `word` becomes '10'. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be at least 10 is still valid but not directly affected by the given code.
