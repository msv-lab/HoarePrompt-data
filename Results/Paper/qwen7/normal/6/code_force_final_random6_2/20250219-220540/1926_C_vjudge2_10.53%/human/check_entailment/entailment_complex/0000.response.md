Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, it initializes `values` and `sum_values` based on the maximum value in `numbers`, which is incorrect because the numbers are replaced with the sum of their digits, not the digits themselves.
2. The nested loops intended to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 10 to `n` are flawed. The logic to split the number into its last digit and the remaining part is correct but the way `values` and `sum_values` are updated is incorrect.
3. The final output is derived from `sum_values` using the indices from the `numbers` list, which again is based on an incorrect assumption about how `values` and `sum_values` should be constructed and updated.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
