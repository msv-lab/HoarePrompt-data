Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters, which are `10`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(10)` generates numbers from 0 to 9.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Therefore, `i` must be less than 10 for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `i`: It should start at 0.
   - The range parameter (which is 10) does not need adjustment since it is a constant defined outside the loop.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`total`, `t`, `n`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- The loop will execute as long as `i < 10`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
