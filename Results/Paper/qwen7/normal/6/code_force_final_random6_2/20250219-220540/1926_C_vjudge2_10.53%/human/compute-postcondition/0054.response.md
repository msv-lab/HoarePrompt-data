Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `numbers`. On the first iteration, `n` is set to the first element of `numbers`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `numbers` must be a non-empty list.
   - `n` is the first element of `numbers`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `n` will be set to the second element of `numbers`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must still be a non-empty list.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `n` will now be the second element of `numbers`.
   - `numbers` must still be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`numbers` must be a non-empty list, `n` is the second element of `numbers`**
