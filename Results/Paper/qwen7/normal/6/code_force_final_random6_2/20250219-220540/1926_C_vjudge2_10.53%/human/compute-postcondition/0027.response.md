Output State: **`values[i]` is equal to `i`, `total` is increased by `i`, `sum_values[i]` is equal to `total`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total` to `sum_values[i]`. Since `total` is increased by `i` in the initial state, `sum_values[i]` now holds the value of `total`, which is `i` plus whatever value `total` had before (which was increased by `i`). However, since the exact previous value of `total` is not specified, we only know that `sum_values[i]` is equal to the current value of `total`, which is `i` plus the original value of `total` before it was increased by `i`. The values of `values[i]` and `total` remain unchanged from their initial state.
