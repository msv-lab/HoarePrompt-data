Output State: **`values[i]` is equal to `i`**

Explanation: The code `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the index `i` in the list `values`. This means that the element at index `i` in the list `values` is now equal to `i`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
