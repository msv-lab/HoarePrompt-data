Output State: **`i` is 10; `word` is '10'; `remainder` is 1; `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `sum_total` by adding `values[i]` and `sum_values[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 10, so `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`, where `last` and `remainder` are from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.
