Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `n` and the iterable `numbers`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `n`**: The initial value of `n` is not specified in the given state, but we know that the loop will start with the first element of `numbers`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `numbers`**: The state does not provide information about `numbers`, but we know that the loop will iterate over each element of `numbers`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will start with the first element of `numbers`, we need to ensure that `numbers` is a non-empty list and that `n` is set to the first element of `numbers`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 19
- `word` is '19'
- `last` is 9
- `remainder` is 1
- `values[19]` is `values[9] + values[1]`
- `sum_total` is `values[19] + sum_values[18]`
- `sum_values[19]` is `sum_total`

We need to focus on adjusting the state of `numbers` and `n` since these are the variables involved in the loop head.

**Adjusted State**:
- `numbers` must be a non-empty list.
- `n` must be set to the first element of `numbers`.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`numbers` must be a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of `numbers`**.
