Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 9999, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.**

The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
