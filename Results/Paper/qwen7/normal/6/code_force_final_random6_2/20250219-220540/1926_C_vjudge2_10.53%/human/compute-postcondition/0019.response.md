Output State: **`i` is 0; `values` is a list with elements [0, 0]; `total` is 0**

Explanation: The code `sum_values[i] = total` updates the `i`-th element of the list `sum_values` (which is initially `[0]`) to the value of `total`. Since `i` is 0 and `total` is 0, the list `sum_values` becomes `[0, 0]`. The values of `i` and `total` remain unchanged.
