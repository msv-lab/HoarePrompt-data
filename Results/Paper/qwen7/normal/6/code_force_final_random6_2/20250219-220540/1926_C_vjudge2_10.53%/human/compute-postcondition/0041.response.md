Output State: **`i` is 11; `word` is '11'; `remainder` is 1; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. However, since the initial values of `last` and `values` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `values[i]`. We only know that `i` remains 11, `word` remains '11', and `remainder` remains 1. The updated value of `values[i]` depends on the values of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`.
