Output State: **`i` is 11; `word` is '11'; `remainder` is 1; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`; `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`; `sum_values[i]` is `sum_total`**

Explanation: The code updates `sum_values[i]` to be equal to `sum_total`. Since `sum_total` is defined as `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `sum_values[i]` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
