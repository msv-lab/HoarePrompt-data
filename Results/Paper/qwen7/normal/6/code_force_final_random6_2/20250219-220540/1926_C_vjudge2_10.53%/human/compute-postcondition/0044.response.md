Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `10` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `10` and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `11`.
   - `word` is `'11'`.
   - `remainder` is `1`.
   - `values[i]` is calculated as `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
   - `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.
   - `sum_values[i]` is `sum_total`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` was `11` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `12`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is now `12`, `n` must be at least `11` for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `12`.
   - `n` must be at least `12` for the loop to continue.

7. **Other States**: The other states (`word`, `remainder`, `values[i]`, `sum_total`, `sum_values[i]`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 12, `n` must be at least 12**
