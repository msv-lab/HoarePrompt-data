Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(10)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < 10`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.

3. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, after the previous iteration where `i` was 1, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**: With `i` now being 2, the condition `i < 10` still holds true, so the loop will execute again.

5. **Adjust the other states**: The states of `values` and `total` are not affected by the loop head and remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is now 2.
- `values` remains a list with elements `[0, 1, 1]`.
- `total` remains 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 2, `values` is a list with elements [0, 1, 1], `total` is 1**
