Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts at 1 (since the loop starts with `range(1, n + 1)`).
   - `n` is an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`.

3. **Adjust the state of `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - The value of `n` should be within the range `[2, 50]`.

4. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `t`, `p`, and `v` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
