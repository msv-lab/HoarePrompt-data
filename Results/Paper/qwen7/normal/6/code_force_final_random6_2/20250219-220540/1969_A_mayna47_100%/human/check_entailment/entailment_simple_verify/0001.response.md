### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called correctly in the main loop.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function initializes an array `v` with zeros and updates it with the input values.
   - It then iterates through the friends to check if there exists a pair `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` because sending invitations to both friends in this pair will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints `3`, meaning at least 3 friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments to it, which means `func_1()` will use default values, leading to incorrect behavior.
   - The correct approach would be to call `func_1(i)` inside the loop to process each test case properly.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic within `func_1()` is correct for determining the minimum number of invitations needed.
   - However, the main loop is incorrectly calling `func_1()` without passing the necessary test case index, leading to incorrect processing of each test case.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic within `func_1()`.
   - The main issue lies in the main loop, which should pass the current test case index `i` to `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the main loop not passing the necessary test case index to `func_1()`. Therefore, the program will not work as intended due to this missing parameter.

**Correctness**: False

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
