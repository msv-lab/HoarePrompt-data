Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `p` is not yet defined as no code has been executed to create or modify it. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is now an input integer within the specified range, while `t` and the properties of `p` remain as stated in the initial state.
