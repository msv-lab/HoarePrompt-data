Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. In such a scenario, the program always prints 3, which is incorrect according to the problem description. For example, consider the input:

```
2
2
2 1
```

In this case, no friend can come to the party because neither friend 1 nor friend 2 will receive an invitation from their respective best friends. Therefore, the correct output should be 2 (inviting both friends), but the program incorrectly outputs 3. This demonstrates that the program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
