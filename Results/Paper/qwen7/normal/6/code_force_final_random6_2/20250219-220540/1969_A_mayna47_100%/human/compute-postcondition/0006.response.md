Output State: **The program returns the value of v[v[1]], which is equal to 1 based on the given initial state.**

Explanation: Given the initial state where `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`, and `i` is 1, we substitute `i` with 1 to find `v[v[1]]`. According to the initial state, `v[v[1]]` is equal to 1. Therefore, the program returns 1.
