Reasoning:
- The program correctly defines the function `func_1()` which processes each test case.
- The function initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with zeros, and then updates it based on the input list `p`.
- The function checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it means at least 2 friends will come to the party, and the function prints `2` and returns.
- If no such pair is found, the function prints `3` because it needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party (as per the problem constraints and examples).

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the problem description, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
