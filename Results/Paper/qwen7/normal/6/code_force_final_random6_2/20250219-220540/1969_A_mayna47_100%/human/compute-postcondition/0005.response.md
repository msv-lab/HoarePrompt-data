Output: **2**

Explanation: The initial state provides that `i` is set to 1 and `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The value of `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`. However, the print statement simply outputs the number 2, and does not depend on the values of `i`, `n`, or `v`. Therefore, the output is **2**.
