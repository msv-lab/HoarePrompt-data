Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and the condition `v[v[i]] != i` holds, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2)`.

Let's break it down:

1. The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The variable `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, but its exact value is not specified.
3. The list `v` is not explicitly defined, but we know that `v[v[i]] != i` must hold true. Given `i = 2`, this means `v[v[2]]` should not be equal to 2.

The print statement `print(2)` simply outputs the integer 2. Since no other variables or conditions affect this specific print statement, the output will be:

Output: **2**
