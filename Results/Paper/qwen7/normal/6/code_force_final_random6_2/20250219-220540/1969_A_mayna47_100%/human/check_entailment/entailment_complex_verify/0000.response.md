### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 friends come.
- A friend \(i\) will come to the party if both \(i\) and their best friend \(p_i\) receive invitations.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads an integer \(n\) and a list of integers \(p\) representing the best friends.
   - Constructs a list `v` of length \(n+1\) initialized to zero.
   - Iterates through each friend \(i\) from 1 to \(n\) and checks if \(v[v[i]] == i\).
     - If true, it means \(i\) and \(v[i]\) are each other's best friends, so the function prints 2 and returns.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints 3 and returns.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes the list `v` with zeros.
- The main loop iterates over each test case and calls `func_1()`.
- The function checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends by verifying \(v[v[i]] == i\).
- If such a pair is found, the function prints 2 and returns.
- If no such pair is found, the function prints 3 and returns.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Example 1**: `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - Friend 4 and 5 are each other's best friends, so the function prints 2.
- **Example 2**: `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - No pair of friends are each other's best friends, so the function prints 3.
- **Example 3**: `p = [2, 1]`
  - Friend 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, so the function prints 2.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends and always prints 3, which is incorrect.

#### Evaluation:
- The annotated code shows that the function correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 2 when such a pair is found.
- If no such pair is found, the function correctly prints 3, which is the correct output for the given problem description.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program correctly handles the cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends and prints 3 in such scenarios.

### Final:
Final: **True**
