Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`, `e` is an integer from the input split, `f` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them into a tuple, which is then unpacked into variables `e` and `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
