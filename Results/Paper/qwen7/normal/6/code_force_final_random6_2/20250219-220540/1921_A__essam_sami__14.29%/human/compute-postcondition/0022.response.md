Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `steps` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `a` is the first integer from the input split.
   - `b` is the second integer from the input split.
   - `c` is the first integer entered.
   - `d` is the second integer entered.
   - `g` is updated to the first integer from the input split converted to an integer.
   - `h` is updated to the second integer from the input split converted to an integer.
   - `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
   - `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

2. **Identifying Known Values:**
   - `steps` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `g` and `h` are directly assigned the first and second integers from the input split, respectively, but these integers are not specified in the initial state.
   - `e` and `f` are not mentioned in the initial state, so they are undefined.
   - `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the input split, respectively.
   - `c` and `d` are the first and second integers entered, respectively.
   - Since `n` is defined as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), and `e` and `f` are undefined, we cannot determine their exact values. However, the expression for `n` remains as it is.

3. **Expression for `n`:**
   - Given the initial state, the expression for `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\). Since `e` and `f` are undefined, we cannot simplify this further without knowing their values.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n)`, which will print the value of `n`.

Given the above analysis, since `e` and `f` are undefined, we can only describe `n` in its current form.

Output: **(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)**
