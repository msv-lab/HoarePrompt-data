Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are the first and second integers entered, respectively.
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the input split, which are the same as `c` and `d`.
- `g` and `h` are the first and second integers from the input split converted to integers, which are also the same as `c` and `d`.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\), where \(g = c\) and \(h = d\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\), where \(g = c\) and \(h = d\).

Given that the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`, we can deduce the following:

- Since `g = c` and `h = d`, both `n` and `x` are calculated using the same values \(c\) and \(d\).
- Therefore, `n` and `x` are essentially the same expression evaluated with the same inputs, just in different contexts.

The print statement `print(n)` will print the value of `n`.

Output: **(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)**
