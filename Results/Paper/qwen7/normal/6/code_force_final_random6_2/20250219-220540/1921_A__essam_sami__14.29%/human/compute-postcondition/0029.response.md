Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `e` and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged.
