Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x > n`, then the function proceeds as per the if part. Otherwise, the function proceeds as per the else part.**
