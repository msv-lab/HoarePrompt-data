Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `steps` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `e` is the first integer from the input split, which is the same as `c`.
- `f` is the second integer from the input split, which is the same as `d`.
- `g` is the first integer from the input split, which is the same as `c`.
- `h` is the second integer from the input split, which is the same as `d`.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), but this value is not used in the print statement.
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

Given that `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the same as `c` and `d` respectively, the expression for `x` simplifies to:
\[ x = (c - c) * (c - c) + (d - d) * (d - d) = 0 + 0 = 0 \]

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `x`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
