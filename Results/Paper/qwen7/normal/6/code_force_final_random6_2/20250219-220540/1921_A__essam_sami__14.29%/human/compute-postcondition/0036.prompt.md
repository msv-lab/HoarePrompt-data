Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`, and if `x` is greater than `n`, the function does one action; otherwise, it does another action.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is updated to the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is updated to the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is updated to \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), `x` is updated to \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\). If `x` is greater than `n`, no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x > n`, then the function proceeds as per the if part. Otherwise, the function proceeds as per the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
