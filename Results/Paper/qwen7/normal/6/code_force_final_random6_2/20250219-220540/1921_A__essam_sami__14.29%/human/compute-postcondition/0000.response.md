Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases entered by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets the number of test cases to be processed. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be undefined or zero unless otherwise initialized within the subsequent test cases.
