Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are assigned to `c` and `d`. Since `c` and `d` were previously defined as the first and second integers entered, they remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the first and second integers from the new input split. The values of `t`, `steps`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they retain their previous values.
