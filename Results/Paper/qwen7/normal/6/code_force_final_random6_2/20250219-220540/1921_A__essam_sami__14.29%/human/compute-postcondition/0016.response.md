Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`, `a` is updated to the first integer from the input split, `b` is updated to the second integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `a` and the second integer to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
