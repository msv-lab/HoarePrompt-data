Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.
- The provided program attempts to calculate the squared distance between pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two distances.
- However, this approach is flawed because the smaller distance might not correspond to the diagonal of the square. Instead, it should identify the correct pair of diagonally opposite corners.
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify which pairs of points form the diagonals of the square. This involves checking the differences in both the x and y coordinates to ensure they match the properties of a square's diagonals.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly identify the diagonals and thus will not always produce the correct area. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
