Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t (1 \le t \le 100) such testcases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` will be equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` will be the last two integers entered by the user, `c` and `d` will be the integers entered in the first input, `e` and `f` will be the integers from the second input split, `g` and `h` will be the integers from the last input split. The variable `n` will be the value of \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - b)\) calculated in the last iteration, and `x` will be the value of \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\) calculated in the last iteration. Depending on whether `x` is greater than `n`, either `n` or `x` will be printed in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between the diagonally opposite corners and prints the smaller of the two distances.
