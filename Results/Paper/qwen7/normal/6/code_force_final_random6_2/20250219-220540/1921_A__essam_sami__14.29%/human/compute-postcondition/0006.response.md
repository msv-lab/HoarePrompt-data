Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`**.

This means that the variable `n` is assigned the value of the expression `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, where `g` and `h` are the integers obtained from splitting the input. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
