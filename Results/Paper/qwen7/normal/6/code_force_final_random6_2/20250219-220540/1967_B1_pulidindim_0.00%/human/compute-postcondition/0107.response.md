Output State: `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 4) / 3 + 2 + (n / 4 - 5) / 4 + 3 + ... + (n / m - (m-1)) / m + (m-1)`, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `n / m - m`.

In this final state, `ans` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop. For each iteration `i` where `i` ranges from 2 to `m`, the term `(n / i - (i-1)) / i + (i-1)` is added to `ans`. The loop terminates when `count` exceeds `m`. The value of `count` will be `m + 1` after the loop finishes. `countmins` will be `m - 1` since it is updated as `count - 1` at the start of each iteration. The value of `g` is updated to `n / m - m` at the end of the last iteration.
