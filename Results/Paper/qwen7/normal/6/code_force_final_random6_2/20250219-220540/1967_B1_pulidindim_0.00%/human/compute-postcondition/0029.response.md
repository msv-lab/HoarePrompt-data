Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` must be 4, `ans` is equal to `n` + `n` / `count` / 2 - 1 / `count` + 2, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n` / `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
