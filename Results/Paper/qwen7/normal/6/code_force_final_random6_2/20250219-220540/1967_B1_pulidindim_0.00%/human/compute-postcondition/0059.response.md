Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 3) / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `(n / 3) - 1**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 2. So, `g` becomes `(n / 3) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
