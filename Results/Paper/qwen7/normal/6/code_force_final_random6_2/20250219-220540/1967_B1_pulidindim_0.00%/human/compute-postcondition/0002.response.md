Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, while `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input.
