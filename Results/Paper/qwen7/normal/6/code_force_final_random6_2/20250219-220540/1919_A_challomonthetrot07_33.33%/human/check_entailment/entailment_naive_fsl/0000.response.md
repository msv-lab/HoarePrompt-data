Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of `a` and `b` is incomplete and incorrect. Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate the issues:

1. **Test Case**: `a = 2`, `b = 2`
   - According to the problem description, both players will play optimally. If both `a` and `b` are even, the game will continue until both wallets are empty, resulting in a draw. However, the program incorrectly prints "Bob" in this case.

2. **Test Case**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`
   - Here, `a` is odd and `b` is even. The program incorrectly prints "Alice" because it checks `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` which is false, and falls into the `else` block, printing "Alice".

3. **Test Case**: `a = 4`, `b = 3`
   - In this case, `a` is even and `b` is odd. The program incorrectly prints "Bob" because it checks `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` which is true, and prints "Alice" instead of "Bob".

These examples show that the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
