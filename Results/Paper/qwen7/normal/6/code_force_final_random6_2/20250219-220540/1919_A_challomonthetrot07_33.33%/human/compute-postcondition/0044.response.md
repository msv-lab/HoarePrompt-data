Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers. The values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integers are assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.
