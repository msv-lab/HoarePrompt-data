Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function determines and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for t followed by pairs of integers a and b. It calculates the GCD of a and b for each pair and returns the result.
