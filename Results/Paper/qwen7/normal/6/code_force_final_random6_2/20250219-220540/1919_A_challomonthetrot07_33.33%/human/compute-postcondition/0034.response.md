Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1, and `a` is even, and either `a` is odd or `a` is greater than `b`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `T` remains within the range of 1 to 1000, `i` stays at 0, `a` and `b` retain their properties of being input integers where `a` is even and not equal to 1 or `b`, and `b` is not equal to 1. Additionally, the condition ensures that `a` is either odd (which always holds since it's even and the condition checks for oddness as a fallback) or `a` is greater than `b`.
