Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The other conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
