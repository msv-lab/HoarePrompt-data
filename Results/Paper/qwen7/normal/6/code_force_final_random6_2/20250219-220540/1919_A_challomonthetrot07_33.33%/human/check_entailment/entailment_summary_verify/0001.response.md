### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the solution.

1. **Problem Description and Input/Output**:
   - The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet until someone cannot make a valid move.
   - The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins in their wallets, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It determines the winner based on specific conditions related to \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Given Program**:
   ```python
   def func():
       T = int(input())
       for i in range(T):
           (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
           if a == b:
               print('Bob')
           elif a == 1:
               print('Alice')
           elif b == 1:
               print('Bob')
           elif a % 2 == 1:
               print('Bob')
           elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
               print('Alice')
           elif a > b:
               print('Bob')
           else:
               print('Alice')
   ```

4. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `a == b` → Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the last move and lose.
   - **Case 2**: `a == 1` → Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.
   - **Case 3**: `b == 1` → Bob wins because he can force Alice into a losing position.
   - **Case 4**: `a % 2 == 1` → Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the last move and lose.
   - **Case 5**: `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` → Alice wins because Bob will be forced to make the last move and lose.
   - **Case 6**: `a > b` → Bob wins because he can force Alice into a losing position.
   - **Case 7**: Otherwise, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify these conditions using the provided examples:
     - **Example 1**: `1 1` → Bob wins (Case 1).
     - **Example 2**: `1 4` → Alice wins (Case 2).
     - **Example 3**: `5 3` → Bob wins (Case 6).
     - **Example 4**: `4 5` → Alice wins (Case 5).
     - **Example 5**: `11 9` → Bob wins (Case 6).
     - **Example 6**: `83 91` → Bob wins (Case 6).
     - **Example 7**: `1032 9307` → Alice wins (Case 5).
     - **Example 8**: `839204 7281` → Alice wins (Case 5).
     - **Example 9**: `1000000000 1000000000` → Bob wins (Case 1).
     - **Example 10**: `53110 2024` → Bob wins (Case 6).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The conditions in the program match the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
