Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1, and if `a` is odd, then the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is even, then `a` becomes greater than `b` or `a` remains even while `b` becomes odd.
