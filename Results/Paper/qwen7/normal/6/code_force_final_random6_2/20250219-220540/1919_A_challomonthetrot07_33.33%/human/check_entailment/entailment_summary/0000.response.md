Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the conditions in the program and compare them with the problem description.

1. **Equal Coins**: If \(a == b\), the program prints 'Bob'. This condition is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob will win since Alice starts and she cannot force a win under these circumstances.

2. **Alice with 1 Coin**: If \(a == 1\), the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can remove her last coin and then Bob will be left with his single coin, allowing Alice to win by forcing Bob into a losing position.

3. **Bob with 1 Coin**: If \(b == 1\), the program prints 'Bob'. This is correct because Bob can remove his last coin, leaving Alice with her original amount of coins, and Alice will lose since she cannot force a win.

4. **Odd Number of Coins for Alice**: If \(a \% 2 == 1\), the program prints 'Bob'. This condition is correct because if Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and then swapping wallets, leaving Bob with an even number of coins, which he cannot force into a winning position.

5. **Even Number of Coins for Alice and Odd Number of Coins for Bob**: If \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 1\), the program prints 'Alice'. This condition is correct because Alice can remove one coin and swap wallets, leaving Bob with an even number of coins, which she can then force into a losing position.

6. **Alice with More Coins than Bob**: If \(a > b\), the program prints 'Bob'. This condition is correct because if Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping wallets, leaving Bob with fewer coins.

7. **All Other Cases**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'Alice'. This covers all remaining scenarios where Alice does not have a clear advantage over Bob.

Given that all conditions in the program align with the problem statement and the provided examples, the program is logically sound and correctly implements the game rules.

Correctness: **True**
