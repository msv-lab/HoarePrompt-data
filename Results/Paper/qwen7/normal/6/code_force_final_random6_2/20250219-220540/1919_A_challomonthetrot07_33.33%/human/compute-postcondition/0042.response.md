Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` remains unchanged if it is odd, or becomes greater than `b` if it is even.
