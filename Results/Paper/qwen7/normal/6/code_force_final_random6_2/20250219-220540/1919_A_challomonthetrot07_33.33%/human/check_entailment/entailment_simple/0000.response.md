### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code against the problem statement and the examples given.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `a == b`. According to the problem, if both players have the same number of coins, Bob wins. This is correctly handled.
   - **Case 2**: `a == 1`. If Alice has only one coin, she can force Bob to lose by swapping wallets, making Alice the winner. This is correctly handled.
   - **Case 3**: `b == 1`. If Bob has only one coin, Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping wallets, making Alice the winner. This is correctly handled.
   - **Case 4**: `a % 2 == 1`. If Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets when it's her turn. This is correctly handled.
   - **Case 5**: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`. If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets when it's her turn. This is correctly handled.
   - **Case 6**: `a > b`. If Alice has more coins than Bob, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets when it's her turn. This is correctly handled.
   - **Case 7**: All other cases. If none of the above conditions are met, Alice wins. This is correctly handled.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the code correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the parity and values of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly determines the winner based on the given rules and examples. Therefore, the code is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
