Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if-else block executes is simply the same as the precondition.
