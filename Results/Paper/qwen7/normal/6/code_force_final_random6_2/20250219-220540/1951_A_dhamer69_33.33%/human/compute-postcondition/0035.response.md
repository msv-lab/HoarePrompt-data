Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.
3. **Determine the current state of `t`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is equal to `t - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `t` is now `t - 1`. To satisfy the condition `t > 0`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to ensure it is greater than 0 for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `start` is an integer (no change needed as it is not part of the loop head)
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end` (no change needed as it is not part of the loop head)
- `t` must be greater than 0 (specifically, `t` must be at least 1)

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
