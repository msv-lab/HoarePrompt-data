Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, and the values of these variables remain unchanged unless `n` equals 2. If `n` does not equal 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, or if `count_1` is even and the string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables (`start`, `end`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions related to `count_1` and the string `s` also remain as described in the initial state.
