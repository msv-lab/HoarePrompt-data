Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value entered by the user. If `n` is 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains as is. If `count_1` is even, the string `s` either contains exactly one occurrence of '11' or does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11'.
