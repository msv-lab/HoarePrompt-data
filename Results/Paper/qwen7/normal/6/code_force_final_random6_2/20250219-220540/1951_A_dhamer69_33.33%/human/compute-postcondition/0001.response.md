Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `t`.
3. **Check the current state of `t`**: The current state of `t` is given as an input integer.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t > 0` must be true. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
