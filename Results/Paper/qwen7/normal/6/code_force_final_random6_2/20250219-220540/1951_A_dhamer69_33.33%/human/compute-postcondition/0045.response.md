Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
