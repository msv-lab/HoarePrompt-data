Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is set to `2 * n`.
   - `ul` is incremented by 4 (`ul = ul + 4`).
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `2 * n`.
- Since `a[i] - 1` corresponds to an index in the list `a`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, it implies that `a[i] - 1` is a valid index in the list `a`.

However, the value of `a[i]` itself is not explicitly given. Given that `i` is `2 * n` and `n > 1`, `i` is definitely a positive integer. But without knowing the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`.

Since the print statement prints `a[i]` twice, the output will be two identical values of `a[i]` separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
