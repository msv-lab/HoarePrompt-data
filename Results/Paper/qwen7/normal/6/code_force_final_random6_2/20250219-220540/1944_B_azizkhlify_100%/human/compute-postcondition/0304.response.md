Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `ul` is `ul` plus 2.
   - If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then `ul` remains `k * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `ul` is incremented by 2, so `ul` will be `ul + 2`.
   - We need to check if `ul` equals `k * 2`. If it does, then `ul` remains `k * 2` and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `ul` will be `ul + 2`.
- `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `ul + 2`, `n` must be the same as at the end of the previous iteration**
