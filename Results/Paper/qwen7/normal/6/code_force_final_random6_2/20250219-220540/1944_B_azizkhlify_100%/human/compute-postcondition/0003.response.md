Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
