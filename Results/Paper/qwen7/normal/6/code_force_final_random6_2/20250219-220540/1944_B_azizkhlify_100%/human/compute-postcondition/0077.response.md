Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `re` is `re_prev + 1`.

3. **Determine the new values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (`i = i_prev + 1`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The value of `re` will be `re_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `re` must still be such that it does not equal `k` (otherwise, the loop would have broken).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` becomes `i_prev + 2`.
   - `re` becomes `re_prev + 1`.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and `re` is `re_prev + 1`**.
