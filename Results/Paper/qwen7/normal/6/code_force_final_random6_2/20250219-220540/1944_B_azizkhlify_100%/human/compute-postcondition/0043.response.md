Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `x + 1`.
   - `n` is `y`.
   - `ul` is `z + 2`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as `0`.
   - If `ul` equals `k * 2`, certain conditions hold true; otherwise, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `x + 1` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `x + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same, so it is still `y`.
   - `ul` was `z + 2` in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `ul` will be checked against `k * 2`. If it is `k * 2`, the conditions will change; otherwise, they remain the same as the precondition.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as `0`, but since `i` changes to `x + 2`, `a[i]` will be `a[x + 2]`, and thus `l[a[i] - 1]` will still be `0`.

Given this information, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be `x + 2`.
- `n` remains `y`.
- `ul` will either be `z + 2` (if it was `k * 2` in the previous iteration) or it will remain `z + 2` if it did not equal `k * 2`.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` remains `0`.

Since `ul` is checked against `k * 2`, we need to consider both cases:
- If `ul` was `k * 2` in the previous iteration, then `ul` will now be `z + 2` (unchanged).
- If `ul` was not `k * 2` in the previous iteration, then `ul` will still be `z + 2` (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `ul` is `z + 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as `0`.**
