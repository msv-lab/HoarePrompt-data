Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list of integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 1.

We need to determine the value of `a[i]`.

Given that `i` is `n`, we can substitute `i` with `n` in the expression `a[i]`. Therefore, we need to find the value of `a[n]`.

From the postcondition, we know that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1. Substituting `i` with `n`, this becomes the element at index `a[n] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1.

However, the value of `a[n]` itself is not directly provided. We only know that `a[n] - 1` corresponds to an index in `l` where the value is 1. Without knowing the exact contents of `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[n]`. But we can say that `a[n]` is one more than the index in `l` where the value is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[n]`.

Output: **a[n] (where a[n] is one more than the index in l where the value is 1)**
