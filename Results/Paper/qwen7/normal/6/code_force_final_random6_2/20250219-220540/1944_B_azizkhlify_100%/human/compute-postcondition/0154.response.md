Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is initially set to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on both `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` (which is `2 * n - 1`) is valid according to the loop condition.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` at the start.

Given that `i` is initially set to `2 * n - 1`, we need to check if this value is less than `n`. However, since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, let's analyze the expression `2 * n - 1`:
- If `n = 1`, then `i = 2 * 1 - 1 = 1`, and `i < n` is false.
- If `n > 1`, then `i = 2 * n - 1` will always be less than `n` because `2 * n - 1` is one less than `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is always greater than `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n = 1` would make `i` equal to `n`, and the loop would not execute).

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is `2 * n - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `2 * n - 1`**
