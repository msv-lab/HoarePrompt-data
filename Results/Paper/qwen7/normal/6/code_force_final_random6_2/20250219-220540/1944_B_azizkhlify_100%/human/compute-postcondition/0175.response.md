Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `2 * n`, `ul` is `ul + 4`, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` updates the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Given the initial state, `a[i] - 1` is already known to be 0 because `l[a[i] - 1]` was initially 0. Therefore, no further calculation is needed for `a[i] - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ul`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
