Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-1`; `l[a[n-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, as it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Each element in the list `l` at index `a[i] - 1` will be incremented by 1 for every value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This means that `l[a[n-1] - 1]` will specifically be incremented by 1 during the last iteration of the loop.
