Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `ul` is incremented by 2, but the value of `ul` is not explicitly stated.
- `ur` is `ur + 2`, but the value of `ur` is not explicitly stated.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. However, the code snippet refers to `a[i]` where `i` is 1. This means it will print the first element of `a` twice, separated by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **[a[1]] [a[1]]**
