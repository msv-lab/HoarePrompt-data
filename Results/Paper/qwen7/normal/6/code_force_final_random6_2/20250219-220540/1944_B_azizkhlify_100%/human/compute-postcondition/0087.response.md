Postcondition: **`k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `n`, `a`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain in their initial states. If `k` is true, then after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`. `re` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that satisfy the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k`. The values of `n`, `a`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` are as described in the final state of the third iteration, with no further changes.**
