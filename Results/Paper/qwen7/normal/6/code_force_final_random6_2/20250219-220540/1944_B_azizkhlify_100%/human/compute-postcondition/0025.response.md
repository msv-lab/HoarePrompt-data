Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `l[a[i] - 1]`:** It is explicitly stated that the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This means that when you access the element in list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1`, the value is 2.

2. **Value of `a[i]`:** Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, this implies that `a[i] - 1` must be the index in list `l` where the value 2 is located. Therefore, `a[i]` must be the index in list `a` that corresponds to the position in `l` where the value 2 is found. Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `a[i]` must be the index in `a` that points to the position in `l` where 2 is located. 

3. **Print Statement:** The statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, but since `end=' '` is used, there will be no newline after the second value.

Given that `a[i]` is the index in `a` that points to the position in `l` where the value 2 is located, and since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `a[i]` must be the index in `a` that corresponds to this position.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
