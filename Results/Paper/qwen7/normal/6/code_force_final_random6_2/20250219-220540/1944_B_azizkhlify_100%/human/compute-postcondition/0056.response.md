Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range function).
   - `n` remains in its initial state.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `0 < n`, which simplifies to `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `n > 0` for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, which is correct for the loop to start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The final state should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
