Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This postcondition indicates that regardless of whether the condition `ul == ur` is true or false, the following holds: `i` is incremented to `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `2 * n` remains unchanged, `ur` is incremented by 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
