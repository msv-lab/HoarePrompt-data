Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either `1` or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to `1` and the condition `(re == k)` is true, `re` is incremented by `1`, and `res` now includes `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to `1` and if `re == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
