Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
