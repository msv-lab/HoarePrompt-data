The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0, `i` can be any value less than `n`. However, without additional information about the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot specify an exact value for `i`. We only know that `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (let's call it `i_prev`) and `n` remains the same.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0, the new state will be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**
