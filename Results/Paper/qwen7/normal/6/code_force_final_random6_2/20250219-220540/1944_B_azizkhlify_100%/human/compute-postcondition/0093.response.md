Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in res`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the next element in `res`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `res`. After each iteration, `i` takes the next element from `res`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is set to the next element in `res` at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be the next element in `res`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `res`, and `res` must still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the next element in `res`, `res` must contain at least one element**
