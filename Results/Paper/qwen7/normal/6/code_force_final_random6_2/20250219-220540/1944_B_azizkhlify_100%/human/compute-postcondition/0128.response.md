Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` remains unchanged, `2 * n` remains unchanged, `ur` will be `2 * (2 * n - n) = 2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to 0 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` if the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` is met, and the loop will break if `ul` equals `ur`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` and `2 * n` will stay the same, `ur` will be twice the value of `n`, each element in the array `r` corresponding to indices that were printed will be set to 0, and the loop will terminate if the count of printed elements (`ur`) matches the count of elements checked (`ul`).
