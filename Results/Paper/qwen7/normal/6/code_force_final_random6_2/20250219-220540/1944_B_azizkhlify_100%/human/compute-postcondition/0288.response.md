Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ul` is `ul` plus 2.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
