Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `re` is `re_prev + 1`**, where `re_prev` is the value of `re` at the end of the previous iteration and `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

This means that the variable `re` has been incremented by 1, while `n` and `i` follow their initial conditions and the rule that `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
