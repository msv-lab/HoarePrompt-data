Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. This means `i` starts at `n` and increments until it reaches `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `2 * n` is unchanged.
   - `ur` is `ur + 2`.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `2 * n` remains unchanged.
   - `ur` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop (if `ul` equals `ur`) remains the same.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `2 * n` is unchanged.
- `ur` is `ur + 4` (since it was already incremented by 2 in the previous iteration).
- If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 4`, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
