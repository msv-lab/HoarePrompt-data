Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `ul` is `z + 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged as `0`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or block of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain as they were in the initial state.
