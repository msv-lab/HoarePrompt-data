Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1; `re` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `re += 1` increments the value of `re` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `a`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains `2 * n`, `a` remains a list of integers, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` remains 1.
