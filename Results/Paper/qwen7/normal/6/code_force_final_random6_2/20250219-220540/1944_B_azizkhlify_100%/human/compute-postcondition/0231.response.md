Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `ul` is incremented by 2, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` index is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
