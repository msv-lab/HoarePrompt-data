Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. However, the initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
