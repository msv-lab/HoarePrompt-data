Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, and `ul` is `ul` plus 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` remains 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `ul` equals `k * 2`, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
