Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 6, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `a[i] - 1` was previously 2 (from the postcondition), now `l[2]` is 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
