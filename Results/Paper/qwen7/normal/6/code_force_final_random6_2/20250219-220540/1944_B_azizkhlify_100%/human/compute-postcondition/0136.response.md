Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from input, `k` is an integer value obtained from input, `i` is 2 * `n` + 1, `ur` is 2 * (`n` + 1) - 2 * `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `r` with `n` zeros. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `ur`, `a`, or `l`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
