Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

The print statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `i` is the next index after `i_prev` from the previous iteration. However, without knowing the exact value of `i_prev` or the contents of the list `a`, we cannot specify the exact value of `a[i]`.

Given the information, the output will be the element at the index `i_prev + 1` in the list `a`.

Output: **a[i_prev + 1]**
