Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 6
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (This is an additional piece of information about the loop body, but it does not affect the loop head variables directly).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n + 2` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 6.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 6**
