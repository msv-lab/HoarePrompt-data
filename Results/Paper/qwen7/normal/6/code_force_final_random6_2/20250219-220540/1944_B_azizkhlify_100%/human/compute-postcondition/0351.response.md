Based on the initial state provided, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements of `a` up to index `i-1`. This means that `i` must be an integer greater than 1 because `res` contains elements up to index `i-1`, implying there is at least one element in the list, hence `i-1` is a valid index.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, since `end=' '` is specified to add a space instead of a newline.

Output: **i (where i is an integer greater than 1)**
