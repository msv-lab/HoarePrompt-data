Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for` statement `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` is not directly affected by the loop head but by the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we don't need to change the state of `r[a[i] - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
