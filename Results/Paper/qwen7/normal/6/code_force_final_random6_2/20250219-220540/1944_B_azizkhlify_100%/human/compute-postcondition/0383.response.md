Output State: **`res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Initially, `ur` was equal to `ur` + 2, so now it is equal to `ur` + 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
