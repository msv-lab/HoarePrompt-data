Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1 because if `n` were 0, the loop would not start at all.

3. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n`, the initial value of `i` should be `n`.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`, meaning it will iterate `n` times (from `n` to `2*n-1`).

5. **Final State of `i`**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - We need to set `i` to `n` initially.
   - No other states need adjustment as they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`**.
