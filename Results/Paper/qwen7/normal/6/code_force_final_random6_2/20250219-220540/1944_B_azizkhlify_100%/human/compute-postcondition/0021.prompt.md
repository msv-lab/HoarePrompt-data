Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will have executed `n` times. After all iterations, the variable `l` will be updated such that for each index `j` (where `0 â‰¤ j < n`), `l[j]` will represent how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`) will remain in their initial states except for `i`, which will be equal to `n-1` after the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will contain counts of each unique element in the list `a`, starting from 0 up to the maximum value in `a`. The other variables will retain their initial values, with `i` being set to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`; `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
