Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `a` is created based on the input string split and converted to integers.
