Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is defined as `i_prev + 2`.
- `re` is defined as `re_prev + 1`.

However, the values of `i_prev` and `re_prev` are not explicitly given. Since these values are not specified, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. Therefore, we can only express `i` and `re` in terms of their previous values.

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Given that `i` is `i_prev + 2`, the element printed will be `a[i_prev + 2]`.

Output: **a[i_prev + 2]**
