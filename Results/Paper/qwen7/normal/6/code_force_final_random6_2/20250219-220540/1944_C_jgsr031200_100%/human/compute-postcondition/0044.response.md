Based on the initial state provided:

- `cou` remains 0 or becomes 1.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than -1.
- If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- If `freq[i]` is exactly 1, then `cou` is set to 1 and `i` is set to `k + 1`.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `k + 1`.

Output: **k + 1**
