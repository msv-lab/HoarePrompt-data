Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must still be greater than -1, and if `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The variable `cou` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
