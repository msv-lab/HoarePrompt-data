Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not simulate the game or construct the array `c` in any way.
3. The logic inside `func_1` seems to be counting the frequencies of elements in the input array `arr` and then determining the MEX based on these frequencies, which is not aligned with the game rules.
4. The game involves two players taking turns to modify the arrays `a` and `c` according to specific rules, and the final MEX is determined based on the contents of `c` after the game ends. The current implementation does not simulate these turns or construct the array `c`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
