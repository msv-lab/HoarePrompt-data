The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. Each integer \(a_i\) in the list satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\). The function returns a value based on the relationship between the elements in the list and the integer \(n\).
