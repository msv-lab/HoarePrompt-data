Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency array accordingly.

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - The program then iterates through the frequency array to determine the MEX.
   - If any element appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), it increments the counter `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an element does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Frequency Array**:
   - The frequency array is correctly used to count the occurrences of each element in the input array `arr`.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The logic to determine the MEX is flawed. The program assumes that the first element that appears exactly once or does not appear at all will be the MEX, which is not always true.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program should check for the smallest missing integer after considering the turns of Alice and Bob.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The given program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the frequency counts, which does not account for the strategic moves of the players.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob and directly calculates the MEX based on the frequency counts, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
