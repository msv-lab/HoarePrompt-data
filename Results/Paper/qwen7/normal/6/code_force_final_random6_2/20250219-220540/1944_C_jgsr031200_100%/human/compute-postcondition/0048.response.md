Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `n+1`. The value of `cou` is either 0 or 1, depending on how many times `freq[i]` was 1 during the loop's execution. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value. If at any point `freq[i]` was 0, the loop would have broken early, and if `freq[i]` was greater than or equal to 2, the loop would have continued without breaking.**

This means that after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `cou` will be 0 if no `freq[i]` was 1, or 1 if exactly one `freq[i]` was 1, and `n` will retain its original value.
