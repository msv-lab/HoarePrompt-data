Output State: **`cou` remains 0 or becomes 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than -1, and if `freq[i]` equals 0, the values of `cou`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or block. In this case, since no loop or block context is specified, the impact on the variables `cou`, `i`, `n`, and `freq[i]` remains as per the initial postconditions. The values of these variables do not change, and the conditions they must satisfy are preserved.
