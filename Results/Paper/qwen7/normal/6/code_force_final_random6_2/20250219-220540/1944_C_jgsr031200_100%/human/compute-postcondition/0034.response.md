Output State: **Postcondition: `cou` remains 0 or becomes 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than -1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue the loop with these conditions. If `freq[i]` is less than 2, we also continue the loop with the same conditions. We break out of the loop.**

This means that the loop has been broken, but the conditions for `cou`, `i`, `n`, and `freq[i]` remain as described.
