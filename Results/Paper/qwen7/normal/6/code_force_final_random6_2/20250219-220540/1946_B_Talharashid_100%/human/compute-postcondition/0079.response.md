Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is now 0, then `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele` from the list, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi` before the operation.
