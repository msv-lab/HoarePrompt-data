The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` of length `n` and two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value `maxi` which is the maximum cumulative sum `c` of the list elements under certain conditions (resetting `c` when encountering negative elements whose absolute value is less than or equal to `c`). It then computes the final output as \((2^k \cdot maxi - maxi + sum(a)) \mod 1000000007\) and prints it. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with \(n\) and \(k\) satisfying \(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and the total sum of \(n\) and \(k\) not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
