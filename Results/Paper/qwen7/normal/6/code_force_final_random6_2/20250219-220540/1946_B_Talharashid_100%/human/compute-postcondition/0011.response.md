Output State: **`c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0 remains valid, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` also remain unchanged.
