Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
