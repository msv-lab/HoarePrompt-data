To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`. This means `maxi` holds the maximum value between `c` and whatever `maxi` was previously set to.
   
2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
- `k` is an integer (though its specific value is not provided).
- `l` is a list, and `sum(l)` gives the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Given these details, the expression inside the `print` statement is:
\[ \text{result} = (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007 \]

Since the exact values of `k`, `c`, `maxi`, and `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the components clearly:

- `2^k * maxi`: This term involves raising 2 to the power of `k` and then multiplying it by `maxi`.
- `- maxi`: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of the previous term.
- `+ sum(l)`: This adds the sum of all elements in the list `l` to the result of the previous term.
- `% 1000000007`: Finally, the entire expression is taken modulo 1000000007.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this expression evaluated with the given values of `k`, `maxi`, and `l`.

Output: **(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k, maxi, and l are as described in the initial state)**
