Output State: **`l` must have at least one element; `c` is increased by the value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. Since `l` must have at least one element, `ele` is one of the elements in `l`. The initial conditions of `l` being non-empty and `c` being undefined (or having some initial value) are preserved, but `c` now holds its original value plus the value of `ele`.
