Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`.
   - If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is now 0, then `maxi` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele` from the list, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi` before the operation.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `l`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the start of each iteration, the variable `ele` will be set to the next element in the list `l`.
   - The variables `c` and `maxi` will be adjusted based on the value of `ele`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `ele` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop head, it needs to be adjusted.
   - `c` and `maxi` might change based on the value of `ele`, but their exact values depend on the loop body, which is omitted here. However, we know they will be adjusted according to the conditions given.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.
- `l` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
