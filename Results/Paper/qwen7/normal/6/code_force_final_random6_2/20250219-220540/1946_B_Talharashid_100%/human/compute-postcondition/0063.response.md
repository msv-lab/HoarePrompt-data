Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. Since `c` holds the maximum sum of contiguous subarray elements that are non-negative, and `maxi` holds the maximum value between the final `c` and any negative element's absolute value encountered during the iterations, the new value of `maxi` will reflect the higher of these two values. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
