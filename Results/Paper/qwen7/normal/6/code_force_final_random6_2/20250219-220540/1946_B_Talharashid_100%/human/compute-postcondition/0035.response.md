Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l`, `n`, `k`, `maxi`, or `i`. The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is now 0. The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
