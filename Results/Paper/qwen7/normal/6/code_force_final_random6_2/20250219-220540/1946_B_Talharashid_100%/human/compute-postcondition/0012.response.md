Output State: **`c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between the current value of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
