Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, and for every element `ele` in `l`, `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`.
