Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum sum incorrectly by using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. This formula assumes that the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) can be multiplied by `2 ** k` and then adjusted by subtracting `maxi` and adding the sum of the original array. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of inserting multiple subarray sums optimally to maximize the final sum.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```

Expected Output:
```
17
```

However, the program outputs:
```
10
```

This happens because the program calculates the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) as 10 (from the subarray `[4, -2, 8]`), and then uses the formula `(2 ** 1 * 10 - 10 + 15) % 1000000007`, which results in 10 instead of 17. The correct approach would involve considering all possible ways to insert subarray sums to maximize the final sum, not just multiplying the maximum subarray sum by `2 ** k`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
