Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `l`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element.
   - `c` is the sum of `c` and `ele` if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0.
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `l`, the next element `ele` will be the first element of the remaining list `l`.
   - Therefore, `l` will be reduced by one element, and `ele` will be the first element of the new list `l`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `l` will now be the list without its first element.
- `c` remains unchanged because it is updated inside the loop based on the current `ele`.
- `maxi` remains unchanged because it is updated inside the loop based on the current `c`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element removed), `c` is the sum of `c` and `ele` if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**
