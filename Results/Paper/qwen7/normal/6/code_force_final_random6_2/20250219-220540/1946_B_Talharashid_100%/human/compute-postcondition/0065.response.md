Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`.
   - We don't know the exact values of `c` and `maxi`, but we know that `maxi` has been updated.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the number of iterations completed so far.
   - The input value `int(input())` remains unchanged unless it is explicitly modified outside the loop.

5. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same as it was when the loop started.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `int(input())` remains the same.

Since we don't have the exact value of `int(input())` from the previous iteration, we can represent it as `N` (where `N` is the value of `int(input())`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be equal to `N`**.

To be more precise without knowing the exact value of `N`:

State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be the same as it was at the start of the loop**.
