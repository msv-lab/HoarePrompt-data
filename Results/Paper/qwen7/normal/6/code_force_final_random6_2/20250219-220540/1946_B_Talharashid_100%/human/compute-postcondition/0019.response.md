Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element removed), `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or the way `c` is updated. It only affects `maxi` by ensuring it holds the maximum value between its current value and `c`.
