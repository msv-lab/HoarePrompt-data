Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `hcf` is assigned the value of `numbers[0]`.**

In this step, the variable `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
