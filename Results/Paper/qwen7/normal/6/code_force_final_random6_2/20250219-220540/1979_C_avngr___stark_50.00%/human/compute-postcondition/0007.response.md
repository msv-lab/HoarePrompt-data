Output State: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `hcf` will hold the gcd of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop continuously updates `hcf` to be the gcd of its current value and the next element in `numbers`, effectively reducing `hcf` to its gcd with every element in the list.
