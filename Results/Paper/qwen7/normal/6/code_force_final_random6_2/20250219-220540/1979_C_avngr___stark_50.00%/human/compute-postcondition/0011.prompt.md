You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; k_i is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common divisor of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the gcd of its current value and each subsequent element in `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
