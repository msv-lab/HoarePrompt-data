Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split. After executing the if-else block, either the condition `a < b and b > c` is true, in which case the condition `a < b < c` is false, or the condition `a < b < c` holds true.
