Output: **NONE**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input split. However, the print statement simply outputs the string 'NONE', regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output will be 'NONE'.
