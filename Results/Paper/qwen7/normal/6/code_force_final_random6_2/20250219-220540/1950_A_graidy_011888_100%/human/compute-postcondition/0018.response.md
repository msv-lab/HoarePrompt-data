Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them into variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers obtained from the input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state, so they are described as integers obtained from the input split.
