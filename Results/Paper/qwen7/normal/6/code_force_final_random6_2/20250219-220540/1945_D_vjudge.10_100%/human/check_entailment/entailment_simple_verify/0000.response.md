### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `pergunta` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`).
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `x` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0.
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `i < m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
     - `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `pergunta` is printed.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem because it does not handle the case where Kirill needs to move multiple positions at once to reach his desired position within the first `m` people.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` iterates backward from the last person to the first, updating `x` with the minimum cost of moving to the next person and updating `pergunta` with the minimum cost of reaching any position within the first `m` people.
- The key point is that `x` accumulates the cost of moving from one position to another, and `pergunta` is updated with the minimum cost of reaching any position within the first `m` people.
- The loop ensures that the cost is calculated correctly for each position, and the minimum cost is stored in `pergunta`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any position within the first `m` people.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any position within the first `m` people.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
