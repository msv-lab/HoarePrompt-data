Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the solution.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating backward through the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions by considering the cost of swapping places with people in front of him.
4. The state before the function call is accurately described, including the initialization of variables and their types.
5. The function correctly updates the `pergunta` variable to store the minimum cost found during the iterations.
6. The final print statement outputs the correct result, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

Given the accurate description of the function's behavior and the correct logic, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
