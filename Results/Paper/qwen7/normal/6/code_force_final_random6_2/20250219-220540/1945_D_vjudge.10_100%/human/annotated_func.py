#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of n integers where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 as it was initially. The variable `pergunta` will hold the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of `x` plus each element of the list `a` starting from index `n-1` down to `0`, but only if the index `i` is less than `m`. The variable `x` will be the cumulative sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, `n` will still be at least 1, `pergunta` will be the smallest value between its original value and the sum of `x` and each `a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0` (if `i < m`), and `x` will be the total of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of x and each a[i] for i from n-1 to 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a minimum value involving elements from lists `a` and `b`, and updates a variable `pergunta` accordingly. Specifically, it iterates through the elements of `a` and `b` in reverse order, updating `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of another variable `x` and the current element of `a`. The variable `x` accumulates the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. After processing all elements, the function prints the final value of `pergunta`.
