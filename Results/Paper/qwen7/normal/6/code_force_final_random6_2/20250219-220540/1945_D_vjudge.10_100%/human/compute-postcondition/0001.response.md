Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order. This means `i` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1` and decrements until `i = 0`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider Other Given States**:
   - `pergunta` (number of test cases) does not affect the loop directly.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers but their contents do not affect the loop condition.
   - `x` is 0 and does not affect the loop condition either.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
