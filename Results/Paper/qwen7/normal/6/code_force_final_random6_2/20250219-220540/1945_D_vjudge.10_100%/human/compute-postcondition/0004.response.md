Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i` is less than `m`; `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `pergunta` to be the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is part of the condition and `i` is `n-1`, the value of `pergunta` is now the smaller of its original value and `x + a[n-1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
