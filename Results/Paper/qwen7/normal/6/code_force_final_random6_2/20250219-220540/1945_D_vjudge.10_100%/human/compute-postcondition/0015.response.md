Postcondition: `i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. If `i < m`, `pergunta` and `x` retain these updates. If `i >= m`, the values of `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
