Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[n-2]`, `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`**

Explanation: The code updates `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Given that `i` is `n-2`, the expression `x + a[i]` simplifies to `x + a[n-2]`. The value of `x` is updated to `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are as mentioned in the Output State.
