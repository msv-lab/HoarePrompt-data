Output State: The loop iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. After all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. `pergunta` will be the minimum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, specifically when `i < m`, `pergunta` is updated to `min(pergunta, x + a[i])`. `x` will be the cumulative sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, indicating the loop has finished. `pergunta` will hold the smallest value it was set to during the loop, considering the condition `i < m`. `x` will be the sum of the smaller values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
