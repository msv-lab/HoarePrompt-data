Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[n-2]`, `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`. If `i < m`, `pergunta` and `x` retain these updates. If `i >= m`, the values of `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
