Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. It iterates from the last person to the first person in the queue.
   - If the current position `i` is within the first `m` positions (`i < m`), it updates `pergunta` with the minimum value between its current value and the accumulated cost `x` plus `a[i]`.
   - It accumulates the cost `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person.
4. **Output**: After calculating the minimum cost for the current test case, it prints the result.

The logic in the function `func_1` correctly accounts for the costs associated with moving Kirill to different positions in the queue while ensuring he ends up within the first `m` positions. The use of dynamic programming through the accumulation of costs ensures that the solution is efficient and optimal.
