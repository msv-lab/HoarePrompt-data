You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of n integers where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 as it was initially. The variable `pergunta` will hold the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of `x` plus each element of the list `a` starting from index `n-1` down to `0`, but only if the index `i` is less than `m`. The variable `x` will be the cumulative sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, `n` will still be at least 1, `pergunta` will be the smallest value between its original value and the sum of `x` and each `a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0` (if `i < m`), and `x` will be the total of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of x and each a[i] for i from n-1 to 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: `pergunta` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `a` (a list of n integers), `b` (a list of n integers), `n` (an integer), and `m` (an integer). The function processes each test case based on the given constraints and returns a result for each case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
