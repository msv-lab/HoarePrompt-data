Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it prints 'Alice' if certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.**

- The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- Based on the given conditions, the function prints 'Alice' in specific scenarios and 'Bob' in others.
- There are four distinct cases where the function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob', but the exact conditions leading to these outputs are not specified in the given information.
