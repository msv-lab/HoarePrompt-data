Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers `a` (length `n`) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, with each `a_i` satisfying 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its initial condition, `N` is assigned the value of the input integer, and the conditions for `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
