Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `cd` is either 2 or 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - The length of `nums` is at least 3.
   - If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is set to 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `len(nums) - 3`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(nums) - 2`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where \(0 \leq k \leq len(nums) - 3\)).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `cd`, `t`, `N`, and `nums` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `cd` remains either 2 or 1.
- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` remains the same input integer.
- `nums` remains the same list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cd` is either 2 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
