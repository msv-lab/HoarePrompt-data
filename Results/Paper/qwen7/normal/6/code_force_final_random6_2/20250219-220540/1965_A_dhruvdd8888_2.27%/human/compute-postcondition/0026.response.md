Output State: **`cd` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `cd` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or 0 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
