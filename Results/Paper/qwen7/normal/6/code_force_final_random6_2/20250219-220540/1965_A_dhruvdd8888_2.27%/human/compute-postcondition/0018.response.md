Output State: **`cd` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` must be at least 3, and the current value of `nums[i+1] - nums[i]` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cd` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
