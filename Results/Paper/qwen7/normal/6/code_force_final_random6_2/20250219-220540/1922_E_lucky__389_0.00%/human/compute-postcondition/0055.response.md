Postcondition: **`i` is 0 or 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10]. If `i` is 0, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `i` is 10, `subseq_lens` is updated to [10, 10], and `mx` is updated to be the maximum of `mx` and `i`.**
