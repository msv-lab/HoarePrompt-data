Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mx` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `x` must be at least 3.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop condition).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2, so `2 ** (i + 1)` becomes `2 ** 3 = 8`.
   - For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be at least 8, meaning `x` must be at least 7.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x` to ensure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` holds true for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 7, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
