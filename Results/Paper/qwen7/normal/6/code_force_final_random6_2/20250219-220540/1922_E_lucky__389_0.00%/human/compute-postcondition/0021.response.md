Postcondition: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 511, and `subseq_lens` is an empty list if `i` is initially 0. Otherwise, `i` is 9, `mx` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 510, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.**
