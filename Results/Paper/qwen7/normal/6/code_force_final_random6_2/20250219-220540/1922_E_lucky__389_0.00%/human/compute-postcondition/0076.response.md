Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. The function returns a result based on the given constraints.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes a test case involving two integers, `t` and `X`, and returns a specific value or result based on their values, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the provided information.
