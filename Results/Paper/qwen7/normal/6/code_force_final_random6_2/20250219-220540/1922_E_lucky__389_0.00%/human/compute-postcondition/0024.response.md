Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mx` is 9.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is 510.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Substitute `i = 0` and `x = 510` into the condition: `2 ** (0 + 1) <= 510 + 1`.
   - Simplify: `2 ** 1 <= 511`.
   - This simplifies to `2 <= 511`, which is true.

Since the condition is already true with the current values, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `mx` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 510, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10**
