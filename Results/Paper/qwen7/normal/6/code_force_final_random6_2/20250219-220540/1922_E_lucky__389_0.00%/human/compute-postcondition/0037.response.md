Output State: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10]**.

The code updates `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value (9) and `i` (10), resulting in `mx` becoming 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
