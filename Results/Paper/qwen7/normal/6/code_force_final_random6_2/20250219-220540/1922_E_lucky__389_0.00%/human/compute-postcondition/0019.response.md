Output State: **`i` is 9, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 510, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\), where `i` is 9. So, \(2^9 - 1 = 512 - 1 = 511\). Since `x` must be at least 511 and initially was set to a value that satisfies this condition, after the operation, `x` becomes 510 (511 - 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
