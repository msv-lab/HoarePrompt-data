You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    0 1 0

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. It calculates a sequence of integers based on certain conditions and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The function does not return any value but prints the final sequence length and the sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the case where `X` is a prime number greater than 2. For such values of `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because `X` cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 (which is how the program constructs the array).

For example, if `X = 3`, the program will attempt to construct an array but will fail to do so correctly. The correct approach would be to recognize that for `X = 3`, we can use an array like `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the provided program does not handle this case and will output `-1` instead.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
