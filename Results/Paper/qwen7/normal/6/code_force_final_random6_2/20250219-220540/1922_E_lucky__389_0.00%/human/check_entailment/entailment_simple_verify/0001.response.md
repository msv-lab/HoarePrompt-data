### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The array must have at most 200 elements.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences of an array can be determined by its structure.
   - A key observation is that the number of increasing subsequences of an array can be represented using powers of 2. Specifically, if an array has \(k\) distinct elements, the number of increasing subsequences is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{k}{i}\), which simplifies to \(2^k\).

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - It constructs the array based on these powers of 2.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases, especially when \(X\) cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.

4. **Issues in the Given Code:**
   - The code assumes that \(X-1\) can always be decomposed into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1, which is not always true.
   - For example, if \(X = 13\), the correct decomposition would be \(13 - 1 = 12 = 2^3 + 2^2\), leading to an array of length 5 with values `[3, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and instead appends unnecessary values.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to correctly decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - Construct the array based on this decomposition.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that the state transitions and logic do not align with the intended solution.
   - The loop logic in the annotated code does not correctly handle the decomposition of \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - The final array construction also does not match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        x -= 1
        subseq_lens = []
        i = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x & 1:
                subseq_lens.append(i)
            x >>= 1
            i += 1
        if not subseq_lens:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ansv = [0] * (max(subseq_lens) + 1)
            for length in subseq_lens:
                ansv[length] += 1
            print(len(ansv))
            print(' '.join(map(str, ansv)))
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected code uses bitwise operations to decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
- It then constructs the array based on the lengths derived from the decomposition.
- This ensures that the array constructed has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly handle the decomposition of \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1, leading to incorrect results for certain values of \(X\). The corrected code addresses this issue and provides the correct solution.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
