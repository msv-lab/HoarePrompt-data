Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `x`, while adding the new information about `subseq_lens`.
