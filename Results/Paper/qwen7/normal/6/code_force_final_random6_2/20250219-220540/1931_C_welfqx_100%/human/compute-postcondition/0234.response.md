Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if consecutive elements in the list are identical. If not, it calculates the length of the longest sequence of identical elements from both the original and reversed lists, then prints the difference between the length of the list and the maximum of these two lengths. If the list has only one element or all elements are identical, it prints 0.**
