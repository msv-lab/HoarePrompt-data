Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Each operation involves setting a subarray to a single value and costs `(j - i + 1)` burles.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, no operations are needed, so it prints `0`.
   - If not, it reverses the array and calculates two lengths: `cn` and `ck`. `cn` is the length of the longest prefix where all elements are the same, and `ck` is the length of the longest suffix where all elements are the same.
   - If the first element of the original array and the first element of the reversed array are the same, `cn` is incremented by `ck`.
   - Finally, it prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for determining the longest prefix and suffix with identical elements is correct.
   - The reversal and comparison steps help identify the optimal segment to change.
   - The formula `n - max(cn, ck)` correctly calculates the minimum cost because changing the identified prefix or suffix to a common value will minimize the cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where all elements are already the same (`f == 1`).
   - It correctly identifies the longest prefix and suffix with identical elements.
   - The reversal step ensures that both ends of the array are considered.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
