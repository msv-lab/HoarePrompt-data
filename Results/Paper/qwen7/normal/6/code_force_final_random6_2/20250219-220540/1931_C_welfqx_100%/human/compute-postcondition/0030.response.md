Output State: **`ck` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `cn` is 1.**

The code `ck = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ck`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
