Output State: **`ck` is 1, `ii` is 3, `n` is 4, `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `ck` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number), resulting in `ck` being 1. The values of `ii`, `n`, and the condition `onum[ii]` being equal to `onum[ii + 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
