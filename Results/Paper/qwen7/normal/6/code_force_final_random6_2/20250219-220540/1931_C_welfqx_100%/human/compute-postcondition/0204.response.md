Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ii` is 4
   - `ck` is 1
   - `cn` is either 1 or 2
   - `r` is 5
   - `f` is 1
   - `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list
   - `symb1` is `num[0]`
   - `symb2` is `num[0]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(n - 1)`, meaning it iterates from `0` to `n-2`.

4. **Check the state of `i` and `n` at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4 (which means the loop has already run 4 times)
   - `n` must be greater than 5 (since `i` goes up to `n-2` and `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 6)

5. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 5.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ii` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `ck` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `cn` remains either 1 or 2 (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `r` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `f` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `onum` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `symb1` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).
   - `symb2` remains unchanged (it is not part of the loop head).

7. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - `i` should be 5
   - `n` must be greater than 5

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
