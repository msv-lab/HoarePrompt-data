Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, and the current value of `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
