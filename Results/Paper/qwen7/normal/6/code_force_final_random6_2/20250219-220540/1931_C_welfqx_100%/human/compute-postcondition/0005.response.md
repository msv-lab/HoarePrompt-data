Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1):`. The objects involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts (this is the default behavior of the `range` function).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is 0.
- `f` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num` is a list of integers entered by the user.

We only need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user**
