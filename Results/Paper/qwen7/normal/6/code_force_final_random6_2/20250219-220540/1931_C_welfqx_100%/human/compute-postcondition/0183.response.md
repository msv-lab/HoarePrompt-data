Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `num`, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. This does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `ii`, `n`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
