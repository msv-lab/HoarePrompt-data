Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `cn` is 1**

The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Given that `cn` was initially not specified, it is reasonable to assume it was 0 before this operation. After the increment, `cn` becomes 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
