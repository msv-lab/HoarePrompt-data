Output State: **`ii` is `n-2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`, `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `onum`, and `symb1` equals `symb2`.**

Explanation: The code `cn += ck` increments the value of `cn` by the value of `ck`. The value of `ii` remains `n-2` as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ck` remains the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `onum`, as it is not reassigned. The condition for the loop continues as long as all pairs of consecutive elements in `onum` are equal, which is also unchanged. The value of `symb1` remains equal to `symb2` as it is not affected by the code.
