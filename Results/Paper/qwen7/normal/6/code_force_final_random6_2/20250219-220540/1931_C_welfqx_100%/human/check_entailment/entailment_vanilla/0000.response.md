Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Checking for Homogeneity:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing adjacent elements.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.

3. **Handling Non-Homogeneous Arrays:**
   - If the array is not homogeneous, the program creates a reversed copy of the array (`onum`).
   - It then calculates two values:
     - `cn`: the length of the longest prefix where all elements are the same.
     - `ck`: the length of the longest suffix where all elements are the same.
   - If the first element of the original array (`symb1`) is the same as the first element of the reversed array (`symb2`), it adds `ck` to `cn`.

4. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program prints `n - max(cn, ck)` which represents the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Homogeneous Array:**
   - If the array is homogeneous (all elements are the same), the program correctly outputs `0`.

2. **Non-Homogeneous Array:**
   - The logic for calculating `cn` and `ck` is correct. `cn` captures the length of the longest prefix where all elements are the same, and `ck` captures the length of the longest suffix where all elements are the same.
   - Adding `ck` to `cn` when the first elements match ensures that the longest possible contiguous segment is considered.
   - The final output `n - max(cn, ck)` gives the minimum cost to make all elements equal by either setting the entire array to the prefix or suffix value or by setting a middle segment.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:** The program handles this correctly by printing `0`.
- **All Elements Different:** The program will calculate `cn` and `ck` as `1` and then `n - 1` will be printed, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

**Correctness: True**
