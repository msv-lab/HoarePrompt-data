Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list.**

The code `f = 1` simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. The values of the other variables (`ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, and `onum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
