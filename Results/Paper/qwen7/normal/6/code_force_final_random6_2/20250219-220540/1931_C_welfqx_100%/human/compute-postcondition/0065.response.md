Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `ii = 0` to `ii = n - 2`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `ii` ranges from 0 to `n-2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ii` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Determine the next possible value of `ii`**:
   - Since the loop increments `ii` by 1 in each iteration, the next possible value of `ii` would be `ii + 1`.
   - Given that `ii` is either 1 or 2, the next value of `ii` would be 2 or 3, respectively.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - If `ii` is 2, then `n` must be at least 3 (since `ii < n - 1` implies `2 < n - 1` or `n > 3`).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - If `ii` was 1, the next value of `ii` would be 2, and `n` must still be at least 2.
   - If `ii` was 2, the next value of `ii` would be 3, and `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 3** (if `ii` was 1) or **`ii` is 3, `n` must be at least 3** (if `ii` was 2)**. 

Since both cases are valid based on the initial conditions, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: **`ii` is 2 or 3, `n` must be at least 3**.
