Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in a list called `num`. The values of `t`, `r`, `f`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
