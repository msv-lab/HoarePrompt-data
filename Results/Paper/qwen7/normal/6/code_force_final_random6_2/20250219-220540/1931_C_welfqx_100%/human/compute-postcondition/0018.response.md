Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `j` is `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Since no variables are updated or reassigned, their previous states remain unchanged.
