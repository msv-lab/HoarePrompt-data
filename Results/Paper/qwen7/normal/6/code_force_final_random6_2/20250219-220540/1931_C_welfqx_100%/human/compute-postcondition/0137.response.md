Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ii` is 3
   - `n` is 4

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `ii` to `n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will run as long as `ii < n`.

4. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 3 and `n` is 4. To continue the loop, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `ii` will be incremented to 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

6. **Post-Condition Check**: The postcondition mentioned does not affect the loop condition directly but is relevant for understanding the context. It checks if `onum[3]` is equal to `onum[4]` and sets `ck` accordingly. This information is not necessary for adjusting the loop state.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`ii` is 4, `n` is 4**
