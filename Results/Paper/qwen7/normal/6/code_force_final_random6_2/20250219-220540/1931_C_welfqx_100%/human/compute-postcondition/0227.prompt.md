Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n`.

In the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. This is because the loop runs from `i` in the range `n-1`, meaning it will iterate until `i` reaches `n-1`. Since `i` starts from 0, it will incrementally reach `n-1`, making `i` finally equal to `n` when the loop terminates. The values of other variables such as `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ii` is 4, `ck` is 2, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 5, `ck` is 3 or 2, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`. If `onum[ii]` equals `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is set to 3. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is 6, `ck` is 4 or 3, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1. If `onum[ii]` equals `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ii` becomes 6, `ck` changes to 4 or 3, `cn` remains 1 or 2, and `r` and `f` stay as 5 and 1 respectively. Otherwise, `ii` stays at 6, `ck` remains 3 or 2, `cn` stays 1 or 2, and `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
