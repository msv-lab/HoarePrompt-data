Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in `num` are different, and either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or add new information. It simply continues to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one). Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `f`, and the condition involving `n` and `f` remain unchanged from the initial state.
