You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    #State: All iterations completed. The final output will be based on the last value of `n` provided as input, and the values of `cn` and `ck` calculated during the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if consecutive elements in the list are identical. If not, it calculates the length of the longest sequence of identical elements from both the original and reversed lists, then prints the difference between the length of the list and the maximum of these two lengths. If the list has only one element or all elements are identical, it prints 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple distinct segments that need to be made uniform through the allowed operation.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
4
5
5
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4
0
5
```

In the second test case, the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`. The program incorrectly identifies the longest segment of identical elements as the entire array, leading to an incorrect result of `0` burles. The correct solution would be to change the first half `[1, 2]` to match the second half `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, which requires 5 burles.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple distinct segments, making it incorrect.
