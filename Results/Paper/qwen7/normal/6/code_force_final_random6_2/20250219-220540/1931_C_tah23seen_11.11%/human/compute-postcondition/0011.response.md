Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either the length of `arr` - 2 or the length of `arr` - 3.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` was either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2 initially, after decrementing, `j` will be either the length of `arr` - 2 or the length of `arr` - 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
