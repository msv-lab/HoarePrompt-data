Output State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be greater than or equal to the variable `j`. This is because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Once `i` becomes greater than `j`, the condition `i <= j` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, the array has been checked for matching elements from both ends towards the center, and the loop naturally stops when there are no more pairs to compare or when a mismatch is found.
