To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i` and `j`. The loop condition is `i <= j`.

Let's break down the given postconditions:

1. `i` is either 0 or 1.
2. `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2.
3. The length of `arr` is at least 2.

Additionally, there are two cases based on the equality of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`:

- If `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`, then `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is either the length of `arr` - 2 or the length of `arr` - 3.
- Otherwise, `i` remains either 0 or 1, and `j` remains either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `i <= j` must hold true. Given the constraints, let's analyze the possible values:

- If `i` is 0, then `j` must be at least 0 (since the length of `arr` is at least 2, `j` cannot be negative).
- If `i` is 1, then `j` must be at least 1.

Given the possible values for `j` (either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2), we need to ensure that `j` is still within the valid range for the loop to continue.

Since the loop continues as long as `i <= j`, and considering the constraints, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to adjust `j` to be at least `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be at least `i + 1`.

State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and `j` must be at least `i + 1`**
