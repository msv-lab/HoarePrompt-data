Output State: **`i` is 1; `j` is the length of `arr` - 2**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Initially, `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and it is at least `i + 1`. After decrementing `j` by 1, `j` will be one less than its initial value. Since `i` is 1, `j` cannot be `i` itself, so it must have been the length of `arr` - 1 initially, making it now the length of `arr` - 2.
