Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `i` is greater than or equal to `j`.
   - `i` is not greater than `j` (which means `i` must be equal to `j`).

3. **Determine the requirement for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must be true.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - We know that `i` is equal to `j` (since `i` is greater than or equal to `j` and `i` is not greater than `j`).
   - However, there is no information about the values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop condition requires `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, we need to ensure that these two elements are equal.
   - Given that `i` is equal to `j`, we need to ensure that `arr[j] == arr[j + 1]`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `arr[j] == arr[j + 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `j` and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j + 1]`**
