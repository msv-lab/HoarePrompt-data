Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. In each iteration, it checks if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it increments `i` and decrements `j`. If they are not equal, the loop breaks.
   - After exiting the loop, the function checks if `i` is greater than `j`. If so, it returns `0`, indicating that all elements in the array are already equal.
   - If `i` is not greater than `j`, the function enters another loop that increments `i` as long as the next element in the array is the same as the current element. This step ensures that consecutive duplicate elements are skipped.
   - Finally, the function checks if `j` is not equal to the last index of the array. If so, it returns `j - i + 1`, which represents the cost of making all elements from `i` to `j` equal to the element at position `i`.
   - If `j` is equal to the last index of the array, it returns `j - i`, which is essentially the same as `j - i + 1` since `i` would be `j + 1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where all elements are already equal by returning `0` immediately after the first loop.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array has consecutive duplicates by skipping them in the second loop.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost to make all elements equal is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, which is the correct output based on the logic implemented in `func_1`.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
