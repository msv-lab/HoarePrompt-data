Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement defined in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `j`. It simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional statement if one were present. Therefore, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
