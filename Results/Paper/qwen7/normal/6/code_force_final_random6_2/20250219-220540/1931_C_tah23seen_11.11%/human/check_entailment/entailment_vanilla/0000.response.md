Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, it reads the array `arr` and calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then checks if the elements at these pointers are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward, checking adjacent elements until they find a pair of unequal elements.
   - If the entire array is uniform (i.e., `i > j`), it returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If there is a segment of unequal elements, it calculates the length of this segment (`j - i + 1`) and returns it as the cost. This logic assumes that setting the entire segment to the value of the first element in the segment would be the most cost-effective operation.

However, the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the minimum cost. Specifically, it only considers one operation where the entire segment between `i` and `j` is set to the value of the first element in the segment. It does not consider other possible operations that might be cheaper, such as setting parts of the segment to different values.

Given the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements equal, which can be achieved by potentially splitting the segment into smaller segments and applying multiple operations. The current implementation only considers one operation and does not explore other possible optimal solutions.

Therefore, the provided solution is incomplete and may not always yield the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
