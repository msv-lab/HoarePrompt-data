Output State: **`i` is 1; `j` is the length of `arr` - 2; and the value of `arr[i]` is equal to the value of `arr[j]`.**

The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is set to the length of `arr` - 1. After executing the code, `j` becomes the length of `arr` - 2. All other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still 1 and the condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]` remains true.
