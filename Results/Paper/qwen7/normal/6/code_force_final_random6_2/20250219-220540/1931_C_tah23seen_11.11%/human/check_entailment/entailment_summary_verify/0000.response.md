### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function `func_1` step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation where we can set any subarray to a single value. The cost of such an operation is the length of the subarray.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   i = 0
   j = len(arr) - 1
   ```
   The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` at the beginning and `j` at the end of the array.

2. **First While Loop:**
   ```python
   while i <= j:
       if arr[i] == arr[j]:
           i += 1
           j -= 1
       else:
           break
   ```
   This loop checks if the elements at the current `i` and `j` are the same. If they are, it moves both pointers inward. If they are not, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Check if All Elements are Equal:**
   ```python
   if i > j:
       return 0
   ```
   If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means all elements from `i` to `j` are the same, so the function returns 0, indicating no further operations are needed.

4. **Second While Loop:**
   ```python
   while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
       i += 1
   ```
   This loop ensures that `i` points to the start of a segment where all elements are the same.

5. **Return the Cost:**
   ```python
   if j != len(arr) - 1:
       return j - i + 1
   return j - i
   ```
   The function returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j`. If `j` is not at the end of the array, it includes the element at `j` in the segment, otherwise, it does not.

#### Issues with the Current Implementation:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments:**
   The function only considers the segment from `i` to `j` and does not explore other possible segments. For example, in the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function would incorrectly return 1 because it finds the first mismatch and stops, but the optimal solution is to change the entire array to 1, which costs 4.

2. **No Exploration of Other Segments:**
   The function does not check other possible segments that could lead to a lower cost. It only considers the segment from `i` to `j` and does not explore other potential segments.

3. **Lack of Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   The function does not calculate the minimum cost among all possible segments. It only returns the cost of one segment without considering other possibilities.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only considers one segment and does not explore other possible segments to find the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
