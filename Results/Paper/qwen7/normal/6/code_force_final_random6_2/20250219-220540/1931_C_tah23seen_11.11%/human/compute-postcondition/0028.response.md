Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `i` is equal to `j` + 1 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j + 1]`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is still true.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `i` is equal to `j` + 1.
   - `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j + 1]`.

Since `i` is equal to `j` + 1, we can substitute `j + 1` with `i` in the second condition:
   - `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j + 1]` becomes `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is equivalent to `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must still hold true.
   - This means `arr[i - 1]` must be equal to `arr[i]` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `i` is incremented within the loop (though not explicitly shown), the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`. Therefore, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` will be checked again with `i` incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new condition will check `arr[i]` against `arr[i + 1]`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` at the start of the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `j` + 1 and `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`**
