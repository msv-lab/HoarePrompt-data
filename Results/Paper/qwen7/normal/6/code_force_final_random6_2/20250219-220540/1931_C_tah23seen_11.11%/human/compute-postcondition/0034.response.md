Output State: **The program returns a value that is j - i + 1, where i is equal to j + 4 and the condition arr[i - 1] equals arr[i] holds true.**

This means that the program calculates the difference between `j` and `i` (where `i` is `j + 4`) and adds 1, returning this value. Since `arr[i - 1]` equals `arr[i]`, this condition is met, but no further details about the array values are provided, so we only know the relationship between `i` and `j`.
