You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be greater than or equal to the variable `j`. This is because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Once `i` becomes greater than `j`, the condition `i <= j` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, the array has been checked for matching elements from both ends towards the center, and the loop naturally stops when there are no more pairs to compare or when a mismatch is found.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `i` is not greater than `j`
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: The value of `i` is equal to `j` + 4, and the condition `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` holds true.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns a value that is j - i + 1, where i is equal to j + 4 and the condition arr[i - 1] equals arr[i] holds true.
    #State: The value of `i` is equal to `j` + 4, and the condition `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` holds true, and `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`
    return j - i
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. The list length is between 1 and 200,000, and each element in the list is between 1 and the length of the list. The function returns 0 if no valid pair (i, j) satisfying the given conditions exists. If such a pair exists, it returns the length of the subarray from i to j (inclusive). If no such pair is found, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns a value that is j - i + 1, where i is equal to j + 4 and the condition arr[i - 1] equals arr[i] holds true.

Case_3: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
