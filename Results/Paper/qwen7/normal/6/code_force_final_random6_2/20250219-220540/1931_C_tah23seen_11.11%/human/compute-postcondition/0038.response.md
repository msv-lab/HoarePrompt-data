Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns one of three values based on the conditions met within the list:
- It returns 0 if no valid pair of indices `(i, j)` satisfying specific conditions exists.
- It returns the length of a subarray from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) if a valid pair exists and meets certain criteria.
- It returns -1 if no valid pair is found and the end of the list is reached without meeting the criteria.**

This function essentially checks for specific patterns within the list and returns a value indicating whether such patterns exist and their length, or if none exist, it returns -1.
