Output State: **The value of `i` is equal to `j` + 4, and the condition `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` holds true.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `j + 4`, and the element at index `i - 1` (which is `j + 3`) will be equal to the element at index `i` (which is `j + 4`). The loop continues to increment `i` as long as the adjacent elements in the array are equal, so once it finds a pair of unequal elements, it stops.
