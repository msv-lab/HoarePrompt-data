Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer from the input split by '.', `day` is 'AM'**.

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `h`, or `m`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
