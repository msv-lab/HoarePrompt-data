Postcondition: `h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` equals 12, then `h` remains unchanged.
