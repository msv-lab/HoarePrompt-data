### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` initializes the variable `day` to 'AM'.
   - It reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, processing each test case.

2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
   - It converts `h` and `m` to integers.
   
3. **Handling Midnight and Noon**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM', correctly converting midnight (00:00) to 12:00 AM.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM', correctly converting times like 13:00 to 01:00 PM.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'AM' if the next iteration would incorrectly set it to 'PM'. This is unnecessary because 12:00 PM is already correctly handled by setting `day` to 'PM' before the subtraction.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - It prints the time in the 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The use of `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that the hours and minutes are formatted with leading zeros if necessary.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling `h == 12` is redundant. Since the condition `h > 12` already covers the conversion from 13 to 01 PM, there's no need to separately handle `h == 12`.
- The variable `day` is unnecessarily redefined multiple times within the loop, which can be simplified.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:
- **Initial State**: The input `t` is read, and the loop runs `t` times.
- **Loop Iteration**: For each test case, the time is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), and the conversion logic is applied.
- **Conversion Logic**:
  - If `h` is 0, it is converted to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - If `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted by subtracting 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM' (this is redundant but does not affect the outcome).
- **Output**: The time is printed in the 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment identified the redundancy in handling `h == 12` and suggested simplifying the code. While the original code works correctly, it can be simplified as shown in the corrected code. However, the original code still meets the requirements of the problem statement.
