Functionality: **The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing each converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. After processing all inputs, it prints the last converted time and the corresponding AM/PM indicator. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.**
