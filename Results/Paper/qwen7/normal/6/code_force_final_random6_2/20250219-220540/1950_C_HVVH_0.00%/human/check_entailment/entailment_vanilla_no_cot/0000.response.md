Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. Specifically, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, and it does not properly reset `day` to 'AM' after setting it to 'PM'. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h != 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `day` variable is set correctly for both AM and PM times.
