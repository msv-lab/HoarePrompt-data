Output State: **`h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'AM'.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes user input in the format `h:m` (hours and minutes separated by a colon), converts the first part to an integer and assigns it to `h`, and converts the second part to an integer and assigns it to `m`. It does not affect `day` which remains 'AM'. Therefore, the values of `h` and `m` are updated based on the input, but `day` stays unchanged.
