Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer from the input split by ':' and its value is either greater than 12 or equal to 12, `m` is an integer from the input split by '.', and `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is 12, `h` remains 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `h` is an integer and `m` is an integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12, `m` retains its original value, and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is updated to `h - 12`, `m` retains its original value, and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, then `h` is set to 0, `m` retains its original value, and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is not 0 or greater than 12, then `h` and `m` retain their original values, and `day` remains 'AM'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
