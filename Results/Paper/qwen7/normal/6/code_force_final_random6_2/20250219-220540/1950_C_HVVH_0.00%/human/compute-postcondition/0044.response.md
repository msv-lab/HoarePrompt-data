Output State: **`h` is an integer converted from the first part of the input split by ':', `m` is an integer converted from the second part of the input split by ':', and `day` is 'AM'**.

The code simply changes the value of `day` from 'PM' to 'AM'. The values of `h` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
