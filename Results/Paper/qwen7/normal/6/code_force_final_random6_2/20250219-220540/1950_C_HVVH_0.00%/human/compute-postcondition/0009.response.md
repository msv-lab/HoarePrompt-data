Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer from the input split by ':' and its current value is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from the input split by '.', and `h` is not equal to 0**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the current value of `h`. Since `h` was initially greater than 12, after subtracting 12, `h` will be greater than 0 but less than or equal to 12. The other variables (`n`, `m`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, `h` is now an integer from the input split by ':' and its current value is greater than 0 (since it was originally > 12 and now is > 0), `m` remains an integer from the input split by '.', and `h` is not equal to 0.
