Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `h` is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when `h` is 12, it should be represented as "12:xx PM" without changing to "00:xx AM". However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, which results in an incorrect output for times like "12:00". For example, for the input "12:00", the program outputs "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to `if h >= 12:` instead of `if h > 12:`.
