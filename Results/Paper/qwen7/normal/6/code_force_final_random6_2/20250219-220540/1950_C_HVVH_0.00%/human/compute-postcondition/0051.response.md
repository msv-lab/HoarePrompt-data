To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `h` is an integer.
2. `m` is an integer.

Based on the postconditions, we need to consider different scenarios for the value of `h`:

- If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12, `m` retains its original value, and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is updated to `h - 12`, `m` retains its original value, and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, then `h` is set to 0, `m` retains its original value, and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is neither 0 nor greater than 12, then `h` and `m` retain their original values, and `day` is set to 'AM'.

Given these conditions, the format of the print statement is:

```
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This will print the time in 12-hour format followed by the AM/PM indicator.

Let's analyze the different cases:

### Case 1: `h` is 0
- `h` becomes 12.
- `m` retains its original value.
- `day` is set to 'AM'.

The print statement will output something like:
```
12:MM AM
```
Where `MM` is the original value of `m`.

### Case 2: `h` is greater than 12
- `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
- `m` retains its original value.
- `day` is set to 'PM'.

The print statement will output something like:
```
HH:MM PM
```
Where `HH` is `h - 12` and `MM` is the original value of `m`.

### Case 3: `h` is 12
- `h` becomes 0.
- `m` retains its original value.
- `day` is set to 'PM'.

The print statement will output something like:
```
00:MM PM
```
Where `MM` is the original value of `m`.

### Case 4: `h` is neither 0 nor greater than 12
- `h` retains its original value.
- `m` retains its original value.
- `day` is set to 'AM'.

The print statement will output something like:
```
HH:MM AM
```
Where `HH` is the original value of `h` and `MM` is the original value of `m`.

Since the exact value of `h` and `m` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific numerical output. However, based on the conditions and the format of the print statement, the output will be one of the following formats:

- `12:MM AM`
- `HH:MM PM`
- `00:MM PM`
- `HH:MM AM`

Output: **12:MM AM, HH:MM PM, 00:MM PM, HH:MM AM (where MM is the original value of m and HH is the adjusted value of h based on the conditions)**
