### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in the grid.
2. **Key Points**:
   - The robot can only move left, right, up, or down within the grid.
   - After moving to a new cell, the robot follows the arrow in that cell.
   - The grid has 2 rows and \(n\) columns.
   - Arrows are represented by `<` (left) and `>` (right).
   - Additional constraints include \(n\) being even, and the sum of \(n\) over all test cases not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size \(n\) of the grid.
   - It reads the two rows of the grid as lists of strings.
   - The code checks if the last but one column's arrow in the second row (`b[n-2]`) is a left arrow (`<`).
     - If it is a left arrow, the robot cannot move right from that position and thus cannot reach the last column (2, n).
     - Otherwise, the robot can potentially reach the last column.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the given code is flawed because it does not account for all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The code only checks one specific condition (the last but one column's arrow in the second row), which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
   - The code does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid or consider other possible paths.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: **False**
