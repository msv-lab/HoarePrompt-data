Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
- The string at index `n-2` in `b` is not equal to '<'.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and the contents of the list `b`.

Output: **Yes**
