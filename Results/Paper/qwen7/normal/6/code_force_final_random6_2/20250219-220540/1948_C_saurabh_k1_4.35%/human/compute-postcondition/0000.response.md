Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically ignored. However, the loop itself depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the state before the loop, the only relevant information is the value of `t`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a valid integer within the specified range. Since `t` is already defined as an integer within this range, we can assume that the input will match this condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given constraints.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
