Output State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged, `a` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` takes a new input, converts each character of the input into a string, and assigns the resulting list of strings to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, and `a`) are updated as described above.
