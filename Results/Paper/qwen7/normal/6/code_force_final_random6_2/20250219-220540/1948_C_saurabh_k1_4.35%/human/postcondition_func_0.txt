The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is not '<'. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
