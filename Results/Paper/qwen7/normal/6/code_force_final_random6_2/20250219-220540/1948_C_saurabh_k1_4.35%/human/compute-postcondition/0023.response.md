Postcondition: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged, `a` is now a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is updated to be a list of strings from the new input.**
