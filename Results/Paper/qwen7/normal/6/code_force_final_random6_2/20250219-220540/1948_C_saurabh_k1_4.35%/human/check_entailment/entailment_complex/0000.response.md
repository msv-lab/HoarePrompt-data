Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The function only checks the second last character (`b[n-2]`) of the second row (`b`). This is insufficient because the robot must be able to reach the last column `(2, n)` from the starting position `(1, 1)` by following the arrows. The function should check if there is a path from the start to the end, not just a single condition on the second last cell.

2. **Movement Logic**: The function does not simulate the movement of the robot through the grid. It simply checks a single condition and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on that condition, which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it does not consider scenarios where the robot might get stuck in a loop or where the path to the target cell is blocked by arrows.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

Correctness: **False**
