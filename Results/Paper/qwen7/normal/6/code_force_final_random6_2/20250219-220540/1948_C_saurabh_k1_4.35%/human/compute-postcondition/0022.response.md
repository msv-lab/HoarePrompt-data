Output: **Yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- The string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'.
- `a` remains unchanged and is a list of strings obtained from a previous input.
- `b` is updated to be a list of strings from the new input.

The print statement simply outputs the string 'Yes'. There are no variables or objects from the initial state that need to be evaluated or substituted into this print statement. Therefore, the output is exactly as written: **Yes**.
