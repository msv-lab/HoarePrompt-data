Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the for loop. This means the loop will run based on the user input converted to an integer.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
   - If the string at index `n-2` in `b` is '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will run again if the user inputs another integer.
   - Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the new input for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- The new value of `t` (which will be the next integer input from the user).
- The unchanged values of `n` and `b`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If the string at index `n-2` in `b` is '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'.**
