Output State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes a new input and converts each character of the input into a string, then assigns this list of strings to `b`. The variable `a` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this code. The value of `t` and `n` remain as they were in the initial state, and the condition about the string at index `n-2` in `b` also remains valid.
