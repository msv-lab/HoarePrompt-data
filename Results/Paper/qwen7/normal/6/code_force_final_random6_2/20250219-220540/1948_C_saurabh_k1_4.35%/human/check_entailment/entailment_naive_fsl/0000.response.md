Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only the second-to-last column's direction in the second row and makes a decision based on that. However, this approach is insufficient because the robot's path depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows, not just the last few columns.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the robot can still reach the cell (2, 4) by moving as follows:
1. Start at (1, 1) -> Move right to (1, 2)
2. Move right to (1, 3)
3. Move left to (2, 3)
4. Move right to (2, 4)

However, the program would incorrectly output "No" because `b[n-2]` is `<`, which leads to the incorrect conclusion that the robot cannot reach (2, 4).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
