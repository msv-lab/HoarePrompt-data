Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)) and an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( n \) is even). For each test case, it reads two strings of length \( n \) composed of characters '<' and/or '>'. It then checks if the second-to-last character of the second string is not '<'. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
