### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class is correctly implemented with methods to add edges and root the tree. The `root_tree_non_recursive` method ensures that the tree is rooted properly, and the `subtree_size` attribute is correctly computed.

2. **Postorder Traversal (Function 1)**:
   - Function 1 (`func_1`) performs a postorder traversal to calculate the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes. This is crucial for determining how many components have at least `x` vertices and their sizes after removing some edges.

3. **Recursive Subtree Processing (Function 2)**:
   - Function 2 (`func_2`) recursively processes subtrees to determine the number of good components and their combined size. This function is used within `func_1` to compute these values for each subtree.

4. **Validation of Good Components (Function 3)**:
   - Function 3 (`func_3`) checks if the conditions for having more than `k` good components or exactly `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices are met. This function uses the results from `func_1`.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum `x` (Function 4)**:
   - Function 4 (`func_4`) performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions. It uses `func_3` to validate the conditions for different values of `x`.

6. **Main Function (Function 5)**:
   - Function 5 reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to get the result. This function handles the overall workflow of the program.

### Analysis:
- All functions are correctly implemented and interdependent in a logical manner.
- The logic for determining the maximum `x` is sound and follows the problem statement.
- The binary search approach in `func_4` ensures that the solution is efficient.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summaries.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
