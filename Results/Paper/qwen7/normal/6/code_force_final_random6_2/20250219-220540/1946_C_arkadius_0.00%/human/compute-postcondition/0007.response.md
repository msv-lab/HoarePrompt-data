Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers where u-1 and v-1 are connected by an edge in the tree**.

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` in the tree. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `[u, v]` now holds the values of the two integers input by the user, which correspond to the indices of the nodes being connected.
