Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere, but we need to understand how it works.
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum number \( x \).

2. **Binary Search on \( x \)**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search on \( x \) to find the maximum value where the condition is satisfied.
   - The binary search is implemented correctly with the initial bounds set to 1 and \( n \).

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are helper functions used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing some edges.

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to accumulate the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - `func_2` recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for subtrees.

### Detailed Analysis of Helper Functions

- **`func_1`**:
  - Uses a post-order traversal to ensure all children are processed before the parent.
  - Accumulates the number of good components and the remaining size.
  - This function seems to be correctly implemented for the purpose of accumulating information about the tree structure.

- **`func_2`**:
  - Recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
  - This function also appears to be correctly implemented for the purpose of calculating the required information.

- **`func_3`**:
  - Calls `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size.
  - Checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the remaining size is at least \( x \) when the number of good components equals \( k \).
  - This function seems to be correctly implemented for checking the feasibility.

### Binary Search Implementation

- **`func_4`**:
  - Performs a binary search on \( x \) to find the maximum value where the condition is satisfied.
  - The binary search is implemented correctly, updating the search bounds based on the result of `func_3`.

### Overall Correctness

Given the implementation details:
- The binary search is correctly implemented.
- The helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are correctly implemented to gather the necessary information.
- The logic in `func_4` and `func_3` is sound and should work as intended.

Since all parts of the program seem to be correctly implemented and logically sound, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
