Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` will contain the sum of `good_components` from all children of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`; `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all children of vertex `v`; `stack` has one less element, which was the tuple `(v, postorder)` popped from it.**

This output state reflects that the variables `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` retain their previous values, while the `stack` has been modified by popping the last element `(v, postorder)`.
