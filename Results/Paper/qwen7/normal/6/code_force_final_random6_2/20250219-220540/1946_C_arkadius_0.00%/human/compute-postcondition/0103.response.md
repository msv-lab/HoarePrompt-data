Output State: **All vertices in the tree have their `good_components` attribute set to the sum of `good_components` from all their children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute of each vertex is the total `remaining_size` of all its children.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every vertex in the tree will have updated its `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes based on the recursive processing of all its descendants (child vertices). Specifically:

- For each vertex `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will hold the sum of `good_components` from all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- Similarly, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all its children.

This means that the final state of the tree reflects the aggregated properties of all vertices under each parent vertex, considering the conditions specified in the loop.
