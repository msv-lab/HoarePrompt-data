Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.
- The `tree` object contains `n-1 + k` edges after the root tree has been processed non-recursively starting from vertex 0.

The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is being called and its result is being printed. However, the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided. Given the information, we can infer that `func_4` likely involves the `tree` object, the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges to be removed `k`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_4` is not specified, we can only describe the inputs it receives:

- `tree`: An object representing the tree with `n-1 + k` edges.
- `n`: The number of vertices in the tree.
- `k`: The number of edges to be removed.

Therefore, the output of `func_4(tree, n, k)` will depend on how this function processes these inputs. Without the exact definition of `func_4`, we cannot determine the precise output.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is an object representing the tree with n-1 + k edges, n is the number of vertices in the tree, and k is the number of edges to be removed)**
