Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `tree` is a Tree object initialized with `n` vertices.**

The code initializes a `Tree` object with `n` vertices. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `tree` is created and assigned a `Tree` object initialized with `n` vertices.
