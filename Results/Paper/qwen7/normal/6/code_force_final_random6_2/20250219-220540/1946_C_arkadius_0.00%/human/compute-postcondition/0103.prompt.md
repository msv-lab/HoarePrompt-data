Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` contains the tuple `(s, False)`, `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree where each vertex has attributes `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the edges.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will contain the sum of `good_components` from all children of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all children of vertex `v`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All children of vertex `v` have been processed. If any child's `remaining_size` was less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all such children. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` whose `remaining_size` was greater than or equal to `x`, plus the number of such children. Furthermore, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After executing the if-else block, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will accumulate the good components from all child vertices of `v`. Specifically, for each child vertex `u`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Additionally, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. The `remaining_size` of `v` will be the sum of its own `remaining_size` and the `remaining_size` of all its child vertices.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
