Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an instance of a custom Tree class with methods add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive. The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree.**
