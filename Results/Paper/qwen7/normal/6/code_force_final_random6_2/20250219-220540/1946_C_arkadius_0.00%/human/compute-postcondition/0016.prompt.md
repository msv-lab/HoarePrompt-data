You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an instance of a custom Tree class with methods add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive. The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and the `tree` object contains `n-1 + k` edges, as all possible edges between `n` vertices have been added and `k` edges have been removed.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `tree` object will have exactly `n-1 + k` edges, because initially it would have `n-1` edges (a tree with `n` vertices always has `n-1` edges), and then `k` edges are removed, resulting in `n-1 + k` edges in total. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the list `[u, v]` represents the last pair of vertices for which an edge was added before `k` edges were removed.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where tree is an object representing the tree with n-1 + k edges, n is the number of vertices in the tree, and k is the number of edges to be removed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data from standard input. It reads t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases, where each test case includes integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines describing the edges of a tree. For each test case, it removes k edges from the tree using the custom Tree class's methods and returns the result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
