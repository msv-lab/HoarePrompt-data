Output State: **`beg` is equal to `mid`, `end` and `mid` are adjusted based on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`.**

Explanation: The variable `beg` is reassigned to the current value of `mid`. The values of `end` and `mid` remain unchanged from their previous state, which was determined by the outcome of the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The new value of `beg` is now directly equal to the previous value of `mid`.
