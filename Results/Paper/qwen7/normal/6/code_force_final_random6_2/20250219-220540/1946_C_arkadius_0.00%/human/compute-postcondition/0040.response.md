Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must not be empty; stack contains (u, False)**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((u, False))` appends a tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack`. The initial state of `tree.vertices[v].children` being non-empty is unchanged. The `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)`.
