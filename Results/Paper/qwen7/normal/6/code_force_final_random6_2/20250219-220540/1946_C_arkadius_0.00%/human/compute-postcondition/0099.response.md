Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
