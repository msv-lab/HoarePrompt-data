Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sm` will be the maximum value of the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. The variables `r` and `l` will be set to the indices `[i, j]` that produce this maximum value of `sm`. `over_sum` will also hold this maximum value.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `r` and `l` will point to the pair of indices `(i, j)` where the calculated `sm` is the largest, and `over_sum` will store this maximum `sm` value.
