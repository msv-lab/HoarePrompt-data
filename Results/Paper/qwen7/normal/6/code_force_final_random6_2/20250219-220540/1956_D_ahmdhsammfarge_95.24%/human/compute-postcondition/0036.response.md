Output State: **`j` is 3, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - i + 1), `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be the same as `j` which is 3. Therefore, `r` is set to 3 and `l` is set to 3. The values of `j`, `lst`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
