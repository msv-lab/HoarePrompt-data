Output State: **`j` is 2, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. Since the initial values of `i` and `j` are not explicitly given, they are represented as `i` and `j` in the output state. The other variables (`j`, `lst`, `sm`, and `over_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
