Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, l + 1]], and `n` remains unchanged.**

The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. Since `r` and `l` are non-negative integers and satisfy the condition `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, the values of `r + 1` and `l + 1` are also known. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `r` and `l`, we only know that `ops` now contains the list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The length of the list `lst` (`n`) and the values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
