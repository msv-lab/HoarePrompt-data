Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `j` being equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` remaining as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` being the sum of all elements in `lst` from index `i` to the second last element plus 1 (since `j` will be one past the last valid index), `r` being `i`, and `l` being the last index of `lst`.**

In more detail:
- The loop continues to increment `j` until it reaches the length of `lst`.
- For each iteration, `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements from the start of the list up to but not including `i`, plus the sum of elements from `j+1` to the end of the list, plus a quadratic term based on the difference between `j` and `i`.
- If `sm` becomes greater than `over_sum`, the values of `r` and `l` are updated to the current `i` and `j`, respectively, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.
- After all iterations, `j` will be one past the last valid index of `lst`, meaning `j` will be equal to the length of `lst`. The values of `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize `sm` during the loop's execution, and `sm` will reflect the maximum value found during these iterations.
