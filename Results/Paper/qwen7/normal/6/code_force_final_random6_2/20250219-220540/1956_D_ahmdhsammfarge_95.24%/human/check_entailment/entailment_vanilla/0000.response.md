Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to modify in order to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The logic inside the function is flawed because it calculates the sum of subarrays incorrectly. Specifically, the line `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is trying to calculate the sum of elements outside the subarray `[i, j]` plus the square of the length of the subarray. However, this does not directly help in maximizing the sum of the modified subarray.
   - The function should instead focus on finding the minimum value in each subarray and replacing all elements in that subarray with the next smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is a recursive function that constructs the sequence of operations needed to apply the MEX operation.
   - It is called with parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops` (a list to store the operations).
   - The function seems to be constructing a sequence of operations but does not correctly implement the logic to ensure the MEX operation is applied optimally.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to apply the MEX operation to the identified subarray and update the list accordingly.
   - The function attempts to replace the subarray with the MEX value but does not correctly handle the case where the MEX value is already present in the subarray.
   - The function also includes redundant operations and does not efficiently construct the sequence of operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They do not correctly identify the optimal subarray to modify or construct the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array.

### Correctness

**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal subarray and construct the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array.
