### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` aims to find the indices \( l \) and \( r \) that maximize the sum of the elements in the array before index \( i \) and after index \( j \), plus the square of the distance between \( j \) and \( i \).
- This approach does not directly relate to the MEX operation, which is the core of the problem. The MEX operation involves finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given subarray.
- The function `func_1` uses a brute-force method to check all possible subarrays, which is inefficient and does not guarantee the correct solution.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` appears to be a recursive function that appends operations to the list `ops`.
- It does not perform any meaningful operation related to the MEX or the goal of maximizing the array sum.

#### Function `func_3`:
- The function `func_3` also seems to be a recursive function that appends operations to the list `ops`.
- It does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the logic to maximize the array sum.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program logic starts by calling `func_1` to find the optimal subarray indices.
- It then calls `func_3` to modify the array according to the found indices.
- Finally, it tries to set all elements to 1 if they are 0, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:
1. Incorrect implementation of the MEX operation.
2. Inefficient and incorrect logic for finding the optimal subarray.
3. Misalignment of the operations with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
