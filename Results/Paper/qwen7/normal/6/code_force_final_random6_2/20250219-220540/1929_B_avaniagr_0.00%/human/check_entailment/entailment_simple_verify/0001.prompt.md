You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop processes each line of input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, `n` and `k` are integers where `n` is between 2 and \(10^8\) inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and \(4n - 2\) inclusive. After processing all lines, the loop terminates, and the final values of `n` and `k` from the last line of input are used in the calculation.
    #
    #The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluates to either the value of `2 * n` or `k` itself, depending on the relationship between `k` and `4 * n - 3`. Specifically, if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the result is `2 * n`; if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the result is `k`; otherwise, it is `2 * n`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is the result of applying this expression to the last line's `n` and `k` values processed by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from standard input.
   - It uses `[*open(0)][1:]` to read all lines except the first one. This is equivalent to reading all lines starting from the second line.

2. **Parsing Input**:
   - Each line is split into two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Logic for Coloring Cells**:
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover half of the diagonals plus an additional cell if \( k \) is odd.
   - The condition `(k < 4 * n - 3)` checks if the required number of diagonals is less than the total number of diagonals minus 3.
   - The term `2 * n` represents the minimum number of cells needed if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( 4n - 3 \).
   - The final term `(k == 4 * n - 2)` ensures that if \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), the result is adjusted accordingly.

### Detailed Explanation of the Logic

1. **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**:
   - If \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \), the formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2)
     \]
   - This formula ensures that we color enough cells to cover at least \( k \) diagonals.

2. **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**:
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( 4n - 3 \), the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{result} = 2n
     \]
   - This means we need to color all cells in at least one row or column to ensure all diagonals are covered.

3. **Special Case: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**:
   - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), the formula ensures that the result is correctly adjusted.

### Testing the Logic with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - \( 4 < 4 \times 3 - 3 = 9 \)
  - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 2 + 0 = 2 \)
  - Result: 2 (Correct)

- **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( 3 < 4 \times 3 - 3 = 9 \)
  - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - Result: 2 (Correct)

- **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - \( 10 \geq 4 \times 3 - 3 = 9 \)
  - \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
  - Result: 6 (Correct)

- **Example 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - \( 9 \geq 4 \times 3 - 3 = 9 \)
  - \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
  - Result: 5 (Incorrect, should be 6)

- **Example 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - \( 7 < 4 \times 4 - 3 = 13 \)
  - \( 7 // 2 + 7 \% 2 = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
  - Result: 4 (Correct)

- **Example 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - \( 11 < 4 \times 7 - 3 = 25 \)
  - \( 11 // 2 + 11 \% 2 = 5 + 1 = 6 \)
  - Result: 6 (Correct)

- **Example 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( 3 < 4 \times 2 - 3 = 5 \)
  - \( 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - Result: 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the examples, it appears that the logic in the program does not handle the special case \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly. The formula should adjust the result when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \).
