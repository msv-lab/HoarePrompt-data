You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop processes each line of input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, `n` and `k` are integers where `n` is between 2 and \(10^8\) inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and \(4n - 2\) inclusive. After processing all lines, the loop terminates, and the final values of `n` and `k` from the last line of input are used in the calculation.
    #
    #The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluates to either the value of `2 * n` or `k` itself, depending on the relationship between `k` and `4 * n - 3`. Specifically, if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the result is `2 * n`; if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the result is `k`; otherwise, it is `2 * n`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is the result of applying this expression to the last line's `n` and `k` values processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives three values (t, n, k) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes these values and may return results based on certain conditions or calculations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
