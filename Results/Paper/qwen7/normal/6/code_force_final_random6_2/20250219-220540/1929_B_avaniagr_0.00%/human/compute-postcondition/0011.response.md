Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives three values (t, n, k) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes these values and may return results based on certain conditions or calculations.**

However, since the exact return value is not specified in the given output cases, the function's primary action is implied to be processing the values of t, n, and k according to some logic not detailed here.
