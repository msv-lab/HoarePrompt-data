Output State: **`s` is split into two parts, `n` is an integer from the first part, `k` is an integer from the second part**.

This means that the string `s` was split using the `split()` function, and the resulting integers were assigned to `n` and `k`. The original string `s` remains unchanged, but it has now been processed to extract two integer values.
