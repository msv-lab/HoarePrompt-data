You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of inputs provided minus one, `x` will be the last input integer provided where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
    #
    #This means that if there were `n` total inputs, `i` would be `n-1`, and `y` would be the value of the last input minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads the values of `t` and `x`, calculates `y` as `x - 1`, and prints `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but leaves the program in a state where the last printed value is `x - 1` for the last test case provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The provided solution sets \( y = x - 1 \).
   - It then prints \( y \).

3. **Checking the Solution**:
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be at least 1 because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and hence coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

4. **Verification**:
   - We need to check if this \( y \) always gives the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - Consider another potential \( y \). If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) other than 1 (since \( y \neq 1 \) because \( y < x \)), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) would be greater than 1, but \( y \) itself would be less than \( x - 1 \). Hence, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) would be less than \( x \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \( y = x - 1 \) ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) and thus \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x \), it indeed provides the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
