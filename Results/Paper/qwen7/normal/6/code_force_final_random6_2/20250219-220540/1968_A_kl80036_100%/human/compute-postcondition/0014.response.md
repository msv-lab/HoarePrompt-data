Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `x`.**

Given the constraints, the function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `x`. However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description focuses on the implied behavior rather than the function signature.
