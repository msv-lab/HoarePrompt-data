Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x - 1`.**

The code `y = x - 1` simply updates the value of `y` to be `x - 1`, without affecting the values of `i` or `x`. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 1, `x` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `y` is now set to `x - 1`.
