Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of inputs provided minus one, `x` will be the last input integer provided where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and `y` will be `x - 1`.

This means that if there were `n` total inputs, `i` would be `n-1`, and `y` would be the value of the last input minus one.
