Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `y` is `x - 1`.

The print statement is `print(y)`, which means it will print the value of `y`.

Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `y` will be an integer between 0 and 999.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is an input integer between 1 and 1000)**
