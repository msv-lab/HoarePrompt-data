You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) and then \( t \) integers \( n \). For each \( n \), it checks if \( n \) is odd or even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) consisting of 'AAB' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of \( s \) is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by \( s \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is odd. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be 'NO'. However, the current implementation prints 'NO' only when `n` is odd, but it does not check for this condition before generating the string. For example, if `n = 1`, the program should print 'NO', but it generates and prints the string 'AAB' which has 3 special characters, not 1. This violates the problem description.
