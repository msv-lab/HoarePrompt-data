Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times**.

Explanation: The code `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` updates the value of `s` to be the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
