The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It sorts the list of integers, subtracts a cumulative sum from each element, and then iterates through the list to determine a boolean value `cw`. Based on the final value of `cw`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob". The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
