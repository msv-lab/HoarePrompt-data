Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; nums is a set containing the elements from the input split into strings, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

The code `nums.add('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
