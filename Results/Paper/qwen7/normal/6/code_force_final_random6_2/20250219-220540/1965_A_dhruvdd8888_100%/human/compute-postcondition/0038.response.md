Output State: **`cw` is `True`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is `len(nums) - 4`, `nw` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `nw = cw` simply assigns the current value of `cw` to `nw`. Since `cw` was previously determined based on the condition involving `nums[len(nums) - 4]`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`ls`, `nums`, `i`) also remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is that `nw` now holds the same value as `cw`, which is `True`.
