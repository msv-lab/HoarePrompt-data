Output State: **`cw` is True, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `nw` is True, and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1**

The code `cw = True` does not change the value of `cw`. It remains `True`. All other variables (`ls`, `nums`, `i`, `nw`, and the condition on `nums[i]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment statement.
