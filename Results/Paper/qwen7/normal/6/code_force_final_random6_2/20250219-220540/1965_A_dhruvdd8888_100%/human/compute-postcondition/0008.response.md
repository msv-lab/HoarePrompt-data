Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ls` is 0 + the first element of `nums`.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(nums)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `ls` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `nums` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

6. **Final State:**
   - `ls` is still 0 + the first element of `nums`.
   - `nums` is still a sorted list of integers including '0'.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`ls` is 0 + the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is 1**.
