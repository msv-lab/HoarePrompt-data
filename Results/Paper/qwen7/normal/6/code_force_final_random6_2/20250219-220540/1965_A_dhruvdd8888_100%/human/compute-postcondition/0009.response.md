Output State: **`nums` is still a sorted list of integers including '0', `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums[i] -= ls` subtracts the value of `ls` from `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is updated by subtracting `ls` from its current value. The other variables and the condition that `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0' remain unchanged.
