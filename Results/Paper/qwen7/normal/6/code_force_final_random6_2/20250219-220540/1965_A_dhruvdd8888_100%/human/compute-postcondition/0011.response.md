Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range of the loop, which is `range(len(nums))`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'.
   - `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - ls`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ls` is `ls + nums[1]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(nums)`.

4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < len(nums)` must still hold true, meaning `len(nums)` should remain unchanged.
   - The value of `ls` should be updated based on the new value of `nums[1]` after the decrement operation.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `ls` will be updated to `ls + nums[2]` because `nums[1]` was already updated to `nums[1] - ls`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`nums` is still a sorted list of integers including '0', `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 2, `ls` is `ls + nums[2]`**
