Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, and `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.
   - `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'.
   - `i` is `len(nums) - 3`.
   - `nw` is `cw`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` to `1` (exclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `len(nums) - 3`, the next value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 4`.
   - The loop condition `range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)` means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `len(nums) - 4`.
   - `nw` will be the value of `cw` from the previous iteration, which is `False` if `nums[len(nums) - 3]` is equal to 1, and `True` if it is not equal to 1.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `cw` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `ls` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `i` becomes `len(nums) - 4`.
   - `nw` remains `cw` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `cw` is `False` if `nums[len(nums) - 3]` is equal to 1, and `True` if `nums[len(nums) - 3]` is not equal to 1; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'; `i` is `len(nums) - 4`; `nw` is `cw`.**
