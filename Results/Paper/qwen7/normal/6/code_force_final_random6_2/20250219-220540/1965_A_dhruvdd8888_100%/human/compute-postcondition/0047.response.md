Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it processes the list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile and returns a result based on the given constraints.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instructions.
