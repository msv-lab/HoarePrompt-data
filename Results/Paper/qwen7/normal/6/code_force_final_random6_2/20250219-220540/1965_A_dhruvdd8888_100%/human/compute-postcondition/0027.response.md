Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means `i` starts from `len(nums) - 2` and decreases until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cw` is `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and `False` if `nums[i]` equals 1.
   - `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'.
   - `i` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `nw` is `True`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1 from its initial value.
   - Therefore, `i` is now `len(nums) - 3`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is now `len(nums) - 3`, we need to ensure that `len(nums) - 3 > 0`, which simplifies to `len(nums) > 3`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cw` remains unchanged as it depends on the current value of `nums[i]`, which hasn't changed yet.
   - `ls` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in `nums`, which hasn't changed yet.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it hasn't been modified yet.
   - `i` is now `len(nums) - 3`.
   - `nw` remains `True` as there is no indication that it should change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cw` is `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and `False` if `nums[i]` equals 1; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'; `i` is `len(nums) - 3`; `nw` is `True`.**
