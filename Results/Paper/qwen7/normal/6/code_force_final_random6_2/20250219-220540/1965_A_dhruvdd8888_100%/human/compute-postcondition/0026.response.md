Output State: **`cw` is `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` equals 1; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'; `i` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than or equal to 0; `nw` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. Since `cw` is defined as `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and `False` if `nums[i]` equals 1, this definition remains unchanged. All other variables (`ls`, `nums`, `i`, and `nw`) retain their initial conditions.
