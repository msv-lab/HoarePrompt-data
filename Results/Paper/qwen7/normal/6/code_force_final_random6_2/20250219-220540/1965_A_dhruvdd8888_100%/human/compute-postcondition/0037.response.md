Postcondition: **`cw` is `False` if `nums[len(nums) - 4]` is equal to 1, and `True` if `nums[len(nums) - 4]` is not equal to 1; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'; `i` is `len(nums) - 4`; `nw` is `cw`. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is flipped to `not cw`. Otherwise, `cw` remains `True`.**
