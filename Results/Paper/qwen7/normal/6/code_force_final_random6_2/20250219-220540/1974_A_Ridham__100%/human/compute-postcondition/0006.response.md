Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x**.

This means that the value of `total_space` is calculated as the sum of `space_y` (which is `y * 4`) and `space_x` (which is `x`). All other variables retain their initial conditions from the initial state.
