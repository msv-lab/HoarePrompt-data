Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is calculated as `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `(space_x - remaining_cells)` is not divisible by 15, otherwise it is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15`, and `result` now contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`**.

This means that the `result` list now includes the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
