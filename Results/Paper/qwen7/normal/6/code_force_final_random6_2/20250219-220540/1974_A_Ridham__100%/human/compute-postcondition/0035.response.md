Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `space_y` is updated to `2 * y` because the initial state specified `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, and the code divides `y` by 2. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `total_space`, `remaining_cells`) retain their initial relationships and values.
