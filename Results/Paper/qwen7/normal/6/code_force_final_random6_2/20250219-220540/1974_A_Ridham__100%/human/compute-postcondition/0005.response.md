Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y * 4` to `space_y`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `space_x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
