Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15`, and `extra_space` is divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The code `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` calculates the integer division of `extra_space` by 15 and assigns the result to `extra_screen`. Since `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` will be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
