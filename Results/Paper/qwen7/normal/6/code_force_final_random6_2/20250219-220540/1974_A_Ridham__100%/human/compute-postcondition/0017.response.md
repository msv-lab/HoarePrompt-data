Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `screen_require_for_y` is appended to the `result` list.**

Explanation: The code appends `screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list, but it does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `remaining_cells` remain unchanged.
