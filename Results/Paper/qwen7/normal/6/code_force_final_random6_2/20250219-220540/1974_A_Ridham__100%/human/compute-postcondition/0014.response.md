Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. The value of `screen_require_for_y` depends on whether `y` is even or odd. However, since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we keep them as they are. The other variables remain unchanged.
