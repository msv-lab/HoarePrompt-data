Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1**.

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `extra_space` by 15 and adding 1. Since `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is effectively `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
