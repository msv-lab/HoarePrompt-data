Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, and if `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.
