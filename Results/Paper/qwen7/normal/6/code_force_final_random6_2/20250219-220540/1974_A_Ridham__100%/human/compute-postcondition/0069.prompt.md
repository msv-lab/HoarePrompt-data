You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of the loop will depend on the value of `n`, the number of iterations the loop runs. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the values calculated for each iteration according to the logic inside the loop. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are read from input, and based on the conditions provided, `screen_require_for_y` and possibly `extra_screen` are calculated. These values are then appended to `result`.
    #
    #If `space_x` (which is initially `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated and added to `screen_require_for_y`, and the sum is appended to `result`.
    #
    #The final `result` will be a list of integers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop. The exact contents of `result` will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: a list of integers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop, with each value on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it takes two integers x and y where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
