You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The final state of the loop will depend on the value of `n`, the number of iterations the loop runs. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the values calculated for each iteration according to the logic inside the loop. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are read from input, and based on the conditions provided, `screen_require_for_y` and possibly `extra_screen` are calculated. These values are then appended to `result`.
    #
    #If `space_x` (which is initially `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated and added to `screen_require_for_y`, and the sum is appended to `result`.
    #
    #The final `result` will be a list of integers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop. The exact contents of `result` will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: a list of integers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop, with each value on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\)). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given conditions and appends it to a list. Finally, it prints each value in the list on a new line. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list of integers derived from the input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and how it is used to determine the number of additional screens needed is incorrect. 

For example, consider the test case `(x, y) = (12, 4)`. According to the problem description, we need to fit 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2 (which occupy 4 cells each). The total number of cells required is \(12 + 4 \times 4 = 28\). Since each screen has 15 cells, we need at least 2 screens. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Let's break down the issue:
- The program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, which is correct.
- It then calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the placement of 1x1 icons efficiently.
- The program then checks if `space_x` (which is just `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` and calculates the number of extra screens needed, which is flawed.

A correct approach would involve more detailed calculations to ensure that the 1x1 icons are placed optimally within the available space after placing the 2x2 icons. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
