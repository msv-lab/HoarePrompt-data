Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Space Occupied by Icons:**
   - The program calculates `space_x` as `x * 1`, which is correct since each `1x1` icon occupies 1 cell.
   - However, the calculation for `space_y` as `y * 4` is incorrect. Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, but the program incorrectly multiplies `y` by 4 instead of considering the actual space taken by these icons.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The variable `remaining_cells` should be calculated based on the total space available in a screen (which is 15 cells) and the space already occupied by the `2x2` icons. The current logic does not correctly account for this.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Extra Screens:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of extra screens needed when there are leftover cells after placing the `2x2` icons is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of `1x1` icons into the remaining space.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Total space required for 2x2 icons
        space_for_2x2 = y * 4
        # Total space required for 1x1 icons
        space_for_1x1 = x * 1
        # Total space required
        total_space_required = space_for_2x2 + space_for_1x1
        # Number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 3) // 4  # Each screen can hold up to 4 2x2 icons
        # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - space_for_2x2
        # Number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x + remaining_space - 1) // 15
        # Total number of screens
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
