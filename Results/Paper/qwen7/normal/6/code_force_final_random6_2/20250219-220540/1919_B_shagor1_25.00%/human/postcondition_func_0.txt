The function processes a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and calculates and prints either `n - 2 * neg` or `n` based on whether `n` is equal to `neg` (the count of '-' characters in `s`). The function implicitly handles multiple test cases by reading inputs until no more are available.
