Output State: **`neg` is 1, `i` is '-', `s` is a non-empty string of '+' and '-' characters.**

Explanation: The variable `neg` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is now irrelevant since it has been incremented). The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to '-' and the code does not modify it. The string `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters as no changes were made to it.
