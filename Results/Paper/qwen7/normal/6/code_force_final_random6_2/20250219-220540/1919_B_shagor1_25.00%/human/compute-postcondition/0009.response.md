Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, and if `i` is '-', then `neg` is 2; otherwise, the values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `neg` is incremented by 1. If the second character `i` in the string `s` was previously '-', then `neg` was 1, and now it becomes 2. If `i` was not '-', the value of `neg` was 0 before, and now it becomes 1. However, since the initial condition specifies that if `i` is '-', then `neg` is 1, we can conclude that `neg` is now 2. The strings `s` and `i` remain unchanged.
