Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`. For each test case, it returns either an integer `t` or a string based on the conditions specified by the string `s`.**
