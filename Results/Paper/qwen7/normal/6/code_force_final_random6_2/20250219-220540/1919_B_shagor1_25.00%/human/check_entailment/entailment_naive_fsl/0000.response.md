Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program only counts the number of negative signs in the string and uses this to compute the penalty. However, the optimal strategy involves splitting the array into segments that balance positive and negative values to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program calculates `n - 2 * neg` which results in `10 - 2 * 7 = -4`, but the correct minimum penalty is 0. The optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where balancing positive and negative values leads to a lower penalty.
