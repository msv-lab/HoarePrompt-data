Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`.
   - `i` is the variable used to iterate over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character (i.e., `len(s) > 0`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `s` is a string of length `n`, and `n` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, we need to ensure that `s` is non-empty.
   - The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` and `i`.

- `s` must be a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`).
- `i` will take on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**.
