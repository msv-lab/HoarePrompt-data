Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array represented by the string `s`.
2. The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of '-' characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
4. It then computes the result using the formula `n - 2 * neg` unless `n` is equal to `neg`, in which case it outputs `n`.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is used. This formula aims to balance the positive and negative contributions to minimize the penalty.
- If `n` equals `neg`, the output is simply `n`. This means the string has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, and the optimal strategy is to split the string into individual elements, each contributing zero penalty.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to compute the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The program processes multiple test cases as expected and uses the appropriate formula based on the conditions mentioned.

Correctness: **True**
