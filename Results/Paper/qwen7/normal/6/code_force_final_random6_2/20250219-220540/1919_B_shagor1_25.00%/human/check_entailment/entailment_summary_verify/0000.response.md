### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array \(a\) into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, reading inputs until no more are available.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - It calculates and prints either `n - 2 * neg` or `n` based on whether `n` is equal to `neg` (the count of '-' characters in `s`).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
   - It then calculates and prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     10
     --+++++++-
     ```
   - Here, `n = 10` and `neg = 7`.
   - The program calculates `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 7 = -4`, but the correct minimum penalty is 0.
   - The optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

5. **Function Summary Evaluation**:
   - The function summary states that the function calculates and prints `n - 2 * neg` or `n` based on whether `n` is equal to `neg`.
   - This summary is misleading because it does not reflect the actual logic of the program, which aims to minimize the penalty by balancing positive and negative values.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.
   - It simply counts the number of '-' characters and applies a formula without considering the optimal splitting of the array.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the given problem description. The program fails to handle cases where balancing positive and negative values leads to a lower penalty.

**Final: False**
