Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i` is not the last character in the string `s`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - `i` is the second character in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is '-', then `neg` is 2; otherwise, the values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second character in the string `s`, for the loop to continue, `i` must not be the last character in `s`. This means `i` must be the third character in `s` for the next iteration.
   - The string `s` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `s` stays the same.
   - The value of `i` will now be the third character in `s`.

5. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` becomes the third character in `s`.
   - `neg` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `neg` stays the same.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `neg` is unchanged (either 0 or 2 depending on the value of the second character)**. 

For simplicity, we can represent the final state as:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `neg` is unchanged**.
