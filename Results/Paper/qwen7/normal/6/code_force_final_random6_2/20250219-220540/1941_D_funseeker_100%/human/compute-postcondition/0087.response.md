Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is an empty set, `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` from the final iteration, and `c` remains either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `ans` contains elements and `c` is either '0' or '?', each iteration removes an element from `ans` and updates `temp` with `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Since the loop will continue until `ans` is empty, after all iterations, `ans` will be an empty set. The variable `c` does not change within the loop and remains either '0' or '?'. The final state of `temp` will contain the last `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` calculated before `ans` becomes empty.
