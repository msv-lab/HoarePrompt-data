Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of input from the standard input stream and returns it as a string.
   - **func_2**: Calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value, which is likely the number of test cases.
   - **func_3**: Calls `func_1()`, splits the returned string into elements, and converts those elements to integers, returning a list of integers.
   - **func_4**: Processes each test case. It reads the number of players \( n \), the number of throws \( m \), and the initial player \( x \). It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player \( x \). For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on whether the throw was clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`). After processing all throws, it ensures that the set `ans` includes all possible players and prints the size of the set and the sorted list of players in the set.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires determining the possible players who could have the ball after a series of throws, given the distance and direction of each throw.
   - The solution correctly processes each test case by updating the set of possible players based on the throw's direction and distance.
   - The final step of replacing `0` with `n` and ensuring the set includes all players is necessary to account for all possible outcomes.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary of `func_4` matches the problem requirements. It correctly processes each throw, updates the set of possible players, and handles the special case of `0` being replaced with `n`.

Given the analysis, the function `func_4` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
