Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element less than before, `temp` now contains (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, and `(q - r) % n`, and `c` remains either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. This means that the set `temp` now includes the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The variable `ans` still contains at least one element less than before, and the variable `c` remains either '0' or '?'.
