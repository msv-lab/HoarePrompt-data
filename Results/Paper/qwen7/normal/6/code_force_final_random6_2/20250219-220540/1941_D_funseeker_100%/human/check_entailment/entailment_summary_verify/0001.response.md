### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it according to the problem statement. It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`. It then processes each throw, updating the set of possible players who could have the ball.

2. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - The program correctly handles both clockwise (`0`) and counterclockwise (`1`) throws, as well as unknown directions (`?`).
   - For each throw, it calculates the new possible positions for the ball using modulo arithmetic to handle circular movement.
   - If the direction is unknown (`?`), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the ball might wrap around the circle (e.g., when adding or subtracting the distance results in `0` or `n`).
   - It ensures that `0` is replaced with `n` if present in the set of possible players.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players and their sorted indices, which matches the required output format.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - The provided example and the structure of the program suggest that it should work for all given constraints and examples.

However, there is a subtle issue in the handling of the modulo operation and the replacement of `0` with `n`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handles the circular nature of the problem.
  - The issue arises when the direction is unknown (`?`). In such cases, the program adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. This is generally correct, but there is a potential edge case to consider.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - When the ball moves in a way that wraps around the circle (i.e., `q - r` or `q + r` results in `0` or `n`), the program correctly handles these cases by ensuring `0` is replaced with `n`.
  - However, the set `ans` should not include `0` if it is not a valid player index. The current implementation might include `0` in the set `temp` and then replace it with `n` later, which could lead to incorrect results if `0` is not a valid player index.

### Corrected Implementation:

To ensure correctness, we should avoid adding `0` to the set `temp` directly. Instead, we should only add valid player indices. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
for _ in range(m):
    (r, c) = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            new_pos = (q + r) % n
            if new_pos != 0:  # Avoid adding 0
                temp.add(new_pos)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            new_pos = (q - r) % n
            if new_pos != 0:  # Avoid adding 0
                temp.add(new_pos)
    ans = temp
```

### Final Evaluation:

After considering the edge case handling and the potential issue with the modulo operation, the original assessment was almost correct but missed the detail about avoiding the addition of `0` to the set `temp`.

**Final: False**

The program needs a small modification to ensure it does not add `0` to the set `temp` directly.
