t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The subsequent m lines contain integers r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and characters c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.
