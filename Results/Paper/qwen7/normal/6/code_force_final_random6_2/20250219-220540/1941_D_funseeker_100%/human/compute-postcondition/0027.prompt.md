Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` will contain `(q + r) % n` and `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `ans` and `temp` remain as they were before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and if `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set containing two values: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element from `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
