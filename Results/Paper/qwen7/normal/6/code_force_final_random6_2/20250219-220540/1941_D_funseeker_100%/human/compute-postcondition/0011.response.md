Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set, and `ans` contains the player `x`. After entering the if condition, if `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` will contain `(q + r) % n` and `ans` remains unchanged.**
