Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, `ans` is now equal to `temp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` simply assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now holds the same set of values as `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
