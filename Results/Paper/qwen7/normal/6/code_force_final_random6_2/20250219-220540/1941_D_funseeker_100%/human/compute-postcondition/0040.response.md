Output State: **`q` is `x`, the value of `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`, and the current value of `c` is '1' or '?'**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `q` is `x`, the new element added to `temp` is `(x - r) % n`. The previous element in `temp` was `(x + r) % n`. Therefore, `temp` now contains both `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`. The values of `q`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the current value of `c` is still either '1' or '?'.
