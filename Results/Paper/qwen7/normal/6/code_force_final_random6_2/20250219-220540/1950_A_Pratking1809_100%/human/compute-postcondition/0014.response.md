Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(q)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
   - Regardless of whether `a < b < c` is true or false, the values of `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - Since `q` is a positive integer and does not change within the loop, `q` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `q` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`q` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user**.
