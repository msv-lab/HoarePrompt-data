Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This information about `t` is not directly relevant to the loop execution but is part of the overall program state.
   - `q` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is a positive integer (since `range(q)` generates numbers from 0 to `q-1`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `q`, `q` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` within the loop is 0 because `range(q)` starts counting from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `q` must be a positive integer.
- `i` must be 0 (the starting value of the loop counter).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`q` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0**
