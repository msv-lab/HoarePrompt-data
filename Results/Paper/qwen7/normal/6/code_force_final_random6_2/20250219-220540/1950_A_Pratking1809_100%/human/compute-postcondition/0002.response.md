Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `q` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `q` remains a positive integer and `i` remains 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.
