Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is decreased by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (this variable is part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is part of the loop head).

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, `n + 1` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3**
