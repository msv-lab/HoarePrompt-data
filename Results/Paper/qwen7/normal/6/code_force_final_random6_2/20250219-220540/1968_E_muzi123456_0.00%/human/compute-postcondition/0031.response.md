Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0 and is equal to `t - 1`. The variable `n` remains as the input integer it was initialized with. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
