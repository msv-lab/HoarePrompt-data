Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). Instead, it simply prints each cell in the form `(1, i)` for `i` from `1` to `n`. This will result in a very small set of Manhattan distances, specifically only `{0, n-1}` for an \(n \times n\) grid, which is not optimal.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to strategically place the points to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances. The example solutions in the problem statement provide some insight into how to achieve this.
