Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Manhattan Distance Calculation**: The program simply prints a sequence of coordinates `(1, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. This means all the points lie on the same vertical line (`x = 1`). As a result, the only possible Manhattan distances are those between points on this line, which are all of the form `|i - j|` for `1 ≤ i, j ≤ n`. This limits the maximum number of distinct distances to `n-1`, which is far less than the maximum possible number of distinct distances for any arrangement of points.

2. **Objective of Maximizing Distances**: The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The example solutions provided in the problem statement show arrangements that achieve significantly more distinct distances. For instance, for \(n=3\), the optimal arrangement includes points that span the entire grid, achieving a larger set of distances.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n=3\), the optimal arrangement should include points that cover a wide range of Manhattan distances, such as \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,1)\). This arrangement results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has 4 elements.
   - The program, however, only outputs points like \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((1,3)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has only 3 elements.

Given these observations, the program does not meet the requirement of maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
