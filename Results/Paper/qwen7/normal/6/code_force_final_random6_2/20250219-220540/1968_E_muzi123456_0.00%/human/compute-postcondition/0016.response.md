Explanation: The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and `i` is set to 3. The variable `n` must be at least 3. There is a loop that increments `i` from 1 to `n`, but since `i` is already set to 3, the loop does not execute any additional iterations. The value of `t` remains unchanged. The `print(' ')` statement simply prints a space character.
