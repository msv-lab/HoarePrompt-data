Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop continues as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., `t > 0`).

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `n`.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be truthy (i.e., `t > 0`).
   - Given that `t` is currently greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that `t` remains greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `t` is already greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to remain truthy.
   - `n` and `i` do not affect the loop condition and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.

**State:**
**`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`**
