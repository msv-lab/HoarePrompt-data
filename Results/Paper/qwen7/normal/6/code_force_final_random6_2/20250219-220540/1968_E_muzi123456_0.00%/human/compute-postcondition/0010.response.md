Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning `i` will increment from `1` to `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `i` is currently `2`, it will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.

6. **Determine the new condition for `n`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be `3` in the next iteration) must still be less than `n + 1`.
   - This means `n` must be at least `2` (since `3 < n + 1` implies `n >= 2`).

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be `3` in the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
