Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
     - This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any other number, it would not satisfy both conditions simultaneously. For example, if `t = 2`, then `t - 1 = 1`, but `t` is not equal to `t - 1`. Similarly, if `t = 0`, `t - 1 = -1`, and again, `t` is not equal to `t - 1`. Therefore, the only value that satisfies both conditions is `t = 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
     - The value of `n` is not specified, so it remains as an input integer.
   - `i` is 2.
     - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(i)`.
     - Since `i` is explicitly given as 2, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Based on this analysis, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **2**
