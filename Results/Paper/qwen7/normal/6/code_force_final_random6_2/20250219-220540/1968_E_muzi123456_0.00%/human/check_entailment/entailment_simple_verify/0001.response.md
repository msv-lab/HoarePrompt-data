### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, the function prints a series of coordinates where the first coordinate is always 1 and the second coordinate ranges from 1 to \(n\).
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         print('1', end=' ')
         print(i)
     ```

3. **Output Pattern**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - For \(n = 3\), the output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - For \(n = 4\), the output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     ```

4. **Manhattan Distances Calculation**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the Manhattan distances are:
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 1): \(0\)
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(1\)
     - Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 2): \(0\)
     Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).

   - For \(n = 3\), the Manhattan distances are:
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 1): \(0\)
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(1\)
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3): \(2\)
     - Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 2): \(0\)
     - Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 3): \(1\)
     - Distance between (1, 3) and (1, 3): \(0\)
     Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\).

   - For \(n = 4\), the Manhattan distances include:
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 1): \(0\)
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(1\)
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3): \(2\)
     - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 4): \(3\)
     - Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 2): \(0\)
     - Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 3): \(1\)
     - Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 4): \(2\)
     - Distance between (1, 3) and (1, 3): \(0\)
     - Distance between (1, 3) and (1, 4): \(1\)
     - Distance between (1, 4) and (1, 4): \(0\)
     Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

5. **Maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The provided function does not generate the most optimal set of distances for larger \(n\). As noted in the original assessment, the function only prints a simple pattern that does not necessarily maximize the set of distances. For example, for \(n = 4\), the optimal arrangement should include more diverse distances, such as:
     ```
     1 1
     1 3
     4 3
     4 4
     ```
     This arrangement results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which is the maximum possible set of distances for \(n = 4\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the function is not correct according to the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
