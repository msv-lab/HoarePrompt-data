Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `t % 5 == 0`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` from its initial calculation to `t * 15 - b * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
