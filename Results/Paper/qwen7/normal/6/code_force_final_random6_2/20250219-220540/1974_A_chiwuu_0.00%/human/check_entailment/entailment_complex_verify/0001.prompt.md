You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.

    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5

    #State: The final value of `t` after all iterations of the loop is determined by the last input values of `a` and `b`, and the operations performed within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a value `t` based on the given inputs and certain conditions. Specifically, it first doubles `b` and adjusts `t` based on whether the doubled value is divisible by 5. Then, it checks if `t` multiplied by 15 minus `b` times 4 is greater than or equal to `a`. If not, it calculates the difference and further adjusts `t` accordingly. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `t` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons.
   - `t = b * 2`: This is the total number of 4-cell areas needed for 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means `t` is perfectly divisible by 5, so `t // 5` gives the exact number of screens needed.
   - Otherwise, it uses `t // 5 + 1` to account for any remainder.

3. **Adjusting for Remaining Space:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - `if t1 >= a`: If there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons, it means no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many more screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2 = a - t1`: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement.
   - `if t2 % 15 == 0`: If the remaining 1x1 icons can fit exactly into full 15-cell spaces, it adds `t2 // 15` to the total.
   - Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for any remainder.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed.

### Testing and Validation

To validate the logic, let's consider the example cases from the problem statement:

1. **Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
     - `t // 5 = 0` (remainder 2), so `t = 1`
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
     - `t2 = 1 - 11 < 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`

     - `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 4 * 2 = 8`
