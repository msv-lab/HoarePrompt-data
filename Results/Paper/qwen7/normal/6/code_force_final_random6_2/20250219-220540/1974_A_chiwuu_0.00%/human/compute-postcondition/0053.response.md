Output State: **`a` is now the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is now the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is `b * 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is now an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4**.

Explanation: The code `t = b * 2` updates the value of `t` to be twice the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
