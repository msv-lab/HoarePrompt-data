Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states. `t2` is now calculated based on the existing value of `a` and the expression for `t1`.
