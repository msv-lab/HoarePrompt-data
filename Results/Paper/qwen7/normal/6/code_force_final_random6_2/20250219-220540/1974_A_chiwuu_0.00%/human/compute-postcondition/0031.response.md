Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` must be 0 (given).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (given).

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer value.
   - `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `b` is an integer value.
   - `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t1` is adjusted to `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15` or `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1` and is set to `t2 // 15` if divisible by 15, otherwise `t2` remains as `a - t1`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t1` is adjusted to `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15` or `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1` and is set to `t2 // 15` if divisible by 15, otherwise `t2` remains as `a - t1`.**
