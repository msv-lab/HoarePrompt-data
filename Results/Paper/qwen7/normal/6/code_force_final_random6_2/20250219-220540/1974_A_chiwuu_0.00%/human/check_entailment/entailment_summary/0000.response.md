Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. **Initial Calculation**: It calculates `t` as `b * 2` and adjusts it based on whether `t` is divisible by 5. This step seems to be an attempt to calculate the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid, but the logic here is flawed.
4. **Further Adjustment**: It then calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This calculation seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, but again, the logic is not clear and may not be accurate.
5. **Final Adjustment**: If `t1` is less than `a`, it calculates `t2` as the difference and further adjusts `t` based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15. This step also seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space but is overly complex and likely incorrect.

Given the problem constraints and the need to minimize the number of screens, the program's logic does not accurately reflect the requirements. The key issue is that the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons to minimize the number of screens.

A correct approach would involve calculating how many full 5x3 grids (screens) are needed to accommodate all the icons, taking into account the different sizes of the icons. The program should consider the total number of cells required and divide by the number of cells per screen (15), rounding up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
