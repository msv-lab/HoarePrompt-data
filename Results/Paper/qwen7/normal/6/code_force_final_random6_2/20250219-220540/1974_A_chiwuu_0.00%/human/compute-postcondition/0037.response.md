Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by performing integer division (`//`) of `t` by 5 and then adding 1. Initially, `t` is equal to `b * 2`. After the operation, `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
