Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is now an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4**.

Explanation: The code `t = t // 5` divides the value of `t` by 5 using integer division. Initially, `t` was defined as `b * 2`. After executing the code, `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
