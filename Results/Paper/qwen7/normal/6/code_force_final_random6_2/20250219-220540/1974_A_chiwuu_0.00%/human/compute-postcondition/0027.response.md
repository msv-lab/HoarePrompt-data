Postcondition: `a` is an integer value, `t` is either `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15` or `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and if `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t2` is set to `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t2` is not divisible by 15.
