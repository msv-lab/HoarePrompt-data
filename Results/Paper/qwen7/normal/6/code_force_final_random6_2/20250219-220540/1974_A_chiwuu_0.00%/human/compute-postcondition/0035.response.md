Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28`**

Explanation: The code `t = b * 2` updates the value of `t` to be `b * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is now `b * 2`, and `t1` is updated to `b * 28` since `t1` was previously defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which now becomes `b * 2 * 15 - b * 4 = b * 28`.
