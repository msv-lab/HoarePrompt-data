### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the program.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The calculation `t = b * 2` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The adjustment `t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0` is correct because it ensures we have enough screens to accommodate the 2x2 icons.

3. **Adjusting for Remaining Space:**
   - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct because it calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - The condition `if t1 >= a` checks if there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation `t2 = a - t1` correctly determines the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement.
   - The adjustment `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0` is correct because it accounts for any remaining 1x1 icons that cannot fit into a full 15-cell space.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the total number of screens needed.

### Testing and Validation

Let's verify the program with the provided examples again:

1. **Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
     - `t // 5 = 0` (remainder 2), so `t = 1`
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
     - `t2 = 1 - 11 < 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
     - `t // 5 = 0` (remainder 4), so `t = 1`
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
     - `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 4 * 2 = 8`
     - `t // 5 = 1` (remainder 3), so `t = 2`
     - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
     - `t2 = 12 - 22 < 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `2`

4. **Case 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 3 * 2 = 6`
     - `t // 5 = 1` (remainder 1), so `t = 2`
     - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
     - `t2 = 0 - 18 < 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `2`

5. **Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`, so `t = 0`
     - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
     - `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1`

6. **Case 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
     - `t // 5 = 0` (remainder 2), so `t = 1`
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
     - `t2 = 8 - 11 < 0`, so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

7. **Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`, so `t = 0`
     - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
     - `t2 = 0 - 0 = 0`, so `t = 0`
   - Output: `0`

8. **Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`, so `t = 0`
     - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
     - `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1`

9. **Case 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`, so `t = 0`
     - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
     - `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1`

10. **Case 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Calculation:
      - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
      - `t // 5 = 0` (remainder 4), so `t = 1`
      - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
      - `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`, so `t = 2`
    - Output: `2`

11. **Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Calculation:
      - `t = 9 * 2 = 18`
      - `t // 5 = 3` (remainder 3), so `t = 4`
      - `t1 = 4 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 36`
      - `t2 = 0 - 36 < 0`, so no additional screens needed.
    - Output: `5`
