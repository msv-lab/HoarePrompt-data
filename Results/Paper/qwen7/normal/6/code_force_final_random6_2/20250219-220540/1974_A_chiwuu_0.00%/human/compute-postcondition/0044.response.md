Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + (b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, and `t1` is defined as `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, the new value of `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + (b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
