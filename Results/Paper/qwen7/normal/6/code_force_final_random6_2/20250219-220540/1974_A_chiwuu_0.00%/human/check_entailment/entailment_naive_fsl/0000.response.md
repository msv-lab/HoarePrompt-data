Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t` and `t1` is flawed. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input `12 4`. According to the problem description, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5x3 grid).

Let's manually calculate the minimum number of screens needed:
- 4 icons of size 2x2 occupy 4 * 4 = 16 cells, which can fit into 2 screens (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).
- We need to place 12 icons of size 1x1, and since each screen can hold up to 15 - 4 = 11 cells from the 2x2 icons, we need an additional 1 screen to place the remaining 12 icons.

So, the total number of screens needed is 2 + 1 = 3.

However, the program outputs 2 for this input, which is incorrect. This shows that the program does not correctly handle the placement of icons of different sizes and the calculation of the minimum number of screens.
