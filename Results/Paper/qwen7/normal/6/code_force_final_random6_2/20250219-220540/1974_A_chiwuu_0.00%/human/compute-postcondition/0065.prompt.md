Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is an integer value, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t1` is adjusted to `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15` or `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1` and is set to `t2 // 15` if divisible by 15, otherwise `t2` remains as `a - t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains as either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to either `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - b * 28 + (b * 2 // 5) * 15 - b * 4) // 15` or `b * 2 // 5 + (b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is updated based on the value of `t1` and `a`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, and `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t2` is `a - t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
