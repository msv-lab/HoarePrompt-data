Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, and `t1` is already calculated as `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - (b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4)) // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
