Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case by reading pairs of integers (`x` and `y`).

2. **Calculating Screen Requirements for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b * 2`: This calculates the total number of 2x2 icon cells needed, which is `2 * y`.
   - The next lines handle the division of these cells into 5x3 grid cells:
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t // 5` gives the exact number of 5x3 cells needed.
     - Otherwise, `t // 5 + 1` accounts for the extra cell needed due to the remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space in the already allocated cells after placing the 2x2 icons. Since each 5x3 cell has 15 spaces and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 spaces, the remaining spaces are calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons in the already allocated cells.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons need additional cells:
     - `t2 = a - t1`: This calculates how many more 1x1 icons need to be placed.
     - The next lines handle the division of these remaining icons into full 5x3 cells:
       - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t2 // 15` gives the exact number of additional 5x3 cells needed.
       - Otherwise, `t2 // 15 + 1` accounts for the extra cell needed due to the remainder.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total number of screens needed is the sum of the initial cells needed for 2x2 icons and any additional cells needed for 1x1 icons.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps in the code, the provided solution appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all icons.

Correctness: **True**
