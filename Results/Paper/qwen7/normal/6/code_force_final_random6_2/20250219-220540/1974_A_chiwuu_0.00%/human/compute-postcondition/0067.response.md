Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a value `t` based on the given inputs and certain conditions. Specifically, it first doubles `b` and adjusts `t` based on whether the doubled value is divisible by 5. Then, it checks if `t` multiplied by 15 minus `b` times 4 is greater than or equal to `a`. If not, it calculates the difference and further adjusts `t` accordingly. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `t` for each test case.**
