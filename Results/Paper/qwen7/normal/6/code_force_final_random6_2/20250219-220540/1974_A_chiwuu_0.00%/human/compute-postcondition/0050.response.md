Output State: **`a` is now the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is now the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code takes two inputs separated by a space and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `b`, and `t1` remain as per their initial conditions since the code does not modify these variables directly. The new values of `a` and `b` are integers derived from the user input.
