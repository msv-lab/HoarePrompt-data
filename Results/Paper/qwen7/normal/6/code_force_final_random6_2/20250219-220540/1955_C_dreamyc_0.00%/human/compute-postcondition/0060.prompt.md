Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a deque of n integers such that 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is less than or equal to \(2 * x\), `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, where `x` is either `a - x` or `b - x` depending on the condition, and `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is appended to `nums` if `ans` is 1 or `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is at least 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, if `b > 0`, `nums` is updated by appending `b` to itself; otherwise, if `ans` is 2, `nums` is updated by appending `b` to itself, and if `ans` is 1, `a` is appended to `nums` if `a > 0` or `b` is appended to `nums` if `b` is less than or equal to 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
