Output State: **`a` is now `a - x`, `b` is `b - x`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element compared to its original state, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is `k - 2 * x`, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b - x`, `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`**

Explanation: The code `k -= 2 * x` decreases the value of `k` by `2 * x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and constraints on the variables also remain the same.
