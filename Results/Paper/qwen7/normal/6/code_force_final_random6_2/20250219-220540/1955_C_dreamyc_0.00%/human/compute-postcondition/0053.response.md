Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is at least 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is appended to `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the value of `a` (which was the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`) to the left end of the deque `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
