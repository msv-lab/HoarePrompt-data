Output State: **`ans` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially either 1 or 2, after this operation, `ans` will be 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged as no other operations are performed on `t`, `k`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.
