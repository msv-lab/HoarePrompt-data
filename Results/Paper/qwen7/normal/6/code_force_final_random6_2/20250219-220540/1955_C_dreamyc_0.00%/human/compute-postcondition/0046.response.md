Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is appended to `nums` if `ans` is 1 or `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()` removes the first element from `nums` and assigns it to `a`, and removes the last element from `nums` and assigns it to `b`. The conditions for `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. If `ans` is 1, `b` will be appended back to `nums`; if `ans` is 2 and `b` is less than or equal to 0, `b` will also be appended to `nums`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
