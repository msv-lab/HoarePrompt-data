Output State: **`a` is now `a - x`, `b` is `b - x`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element compared to its original state, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b - x`, `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`**

Explanation: The code `b -= x` subtracts `x` from `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. The state of `nums`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as they were not modified. The value of `x` is updated to be the minimum of `a` and `b - x`. If `ans` is 2, `b` is less than or equal to 0; otherwise, `b` is appended to `nums`.
