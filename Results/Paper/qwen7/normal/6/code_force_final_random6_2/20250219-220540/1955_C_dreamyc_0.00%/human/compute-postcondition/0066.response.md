Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` represents the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes `nums` by repeatedly reducing pairs of elements until `k` becomes zero or `nums` contains fewer than two elements. During this process, it counts the number of times the second-to-last element (`b`) is reduced to zero or less. Finally, it returns this count, either incremented by one in a specific case or directly as the count.**
