Postcondition: `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`.
