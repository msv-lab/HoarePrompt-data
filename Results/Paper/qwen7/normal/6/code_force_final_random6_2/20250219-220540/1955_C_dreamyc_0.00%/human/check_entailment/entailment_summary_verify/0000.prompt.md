You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:

        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):
        return ans + 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` represents the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes `nums` by repeatedly reducing pairs of elements until `k` becomes zero or `nums` contains fewer than two elements. During this process, it counts the number of times the second-to-last element (`b`) is reduced to zero or less. Finally, it returns this count, either incremented by one in a specific case or directly as the count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the program uses a `deque` to manage the ships' durability, but it does not accurately reflect the alternating pattern of attacking the first and last ships. Instead, it attempts to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships simultaneously in each iteration, which does not match the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
According to the problem description, the sequence of attacks should be:
1. Attack the first ship: Durability becomes [2, 4, 3]
2. Attack the last ship: Durability becomes [2, 4, 2]
3. Attack the first ship: Durability becomes [1, 4, 2]
4. Attack the last ship: Durability becomes [1, 4, 1]
5. Attack the first ship: Durability becomes [0, 4, 1]

However, the provided program incorrectly handles the reduction of durability. It tries to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships simultaneously, which leads to incorrect results. For instance, in the first iteration, it would reduce the durability of both the first and last ships, resulting in [0, 2, 3] instead of [2, 4, 3].

To fix this, the program needs to alternate between attacking the first and last ships in a loop until all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made all its attacks.
