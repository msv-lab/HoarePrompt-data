Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the attacks on the ships.
   - It uses a deque to efficiently handle the first and last elements.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - It enters a loop that continues until there are fewer than 2 ships left or `k` attacks are exhausted.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and reduces both by this value.
   - It updates `k` by subtracting twice this minimum value.
   - If either `a` or `b` is still greater than 0, it appends them back to the deque or increments `ans` if they sink.
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of remaining ships is less than 2, which would break the loop.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the last ship is the only one left and can be sunk with remaining attacks.

### Testing the Logic:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 5 1 2 4 3`
- Output: `2`

- The program processes the attacks as follows:
  1. First attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 3]`
  2. Second attack: `3` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 2]`
  3. Third attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 2]`
  4. Fourth attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 1]`
  5. Fifth attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [4]`

- The final answer is `2` ships sunk, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `4 6 1 2 4 3`
- Output: `3`

- The program processes the attacks as follows:
  1. First attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 3]`
  2. Second attack: `3` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 2]`
  3. Third attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 2]`
  4. Fourth attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 1]`
  5. Fifth attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [4]`
  6. Sixth attack: `4` sinks, `nums = []`

- The final answer is `3` ships sunk, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
