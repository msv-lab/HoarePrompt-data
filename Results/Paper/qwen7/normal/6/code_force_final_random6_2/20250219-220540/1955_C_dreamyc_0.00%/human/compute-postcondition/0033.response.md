Output State: **`a` is now `a - x`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after pop(), `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element compared to its original state, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`**.

Explanation: The value of `a` is decreased by `x`. All other conditions and constraints remain the same. The value of `x` is still the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is either less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, or it is appended to `nums` if `ans` is 1.
