Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling popleft(), `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling pop(), `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is less than or equal to `2 * x`, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is greater than 0, and `nums` now has its first element appended to the left.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the first element of `nums` (after calling `popleft()`) to the left of the deque `nums`. This does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, `x`, or the condition that `a` is greater than 0. The only change is that the value of the first element of `nums` is now also present at the right end of the deque due to the appendleft operation.
