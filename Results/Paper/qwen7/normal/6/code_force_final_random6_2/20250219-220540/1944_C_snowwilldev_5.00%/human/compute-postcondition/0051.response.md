Output State: `t` is 3, `i` is equal to `N`, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each value is 1 if the corresponding key (an element from list `a`) appeared once in the list during the loop execution.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each index from 0 to `N-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `N`. The loop increments `cnt[a[i]]` for each iteration, so if each element in the list `a` was unique, each value in `cnt` would be 1. Given the information, it's clear that the loop has processed all elements in `a` exactly once, leading to each count being 1.
