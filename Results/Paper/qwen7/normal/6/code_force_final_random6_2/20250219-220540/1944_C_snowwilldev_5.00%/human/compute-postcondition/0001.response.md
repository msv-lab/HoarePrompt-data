Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `N` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
