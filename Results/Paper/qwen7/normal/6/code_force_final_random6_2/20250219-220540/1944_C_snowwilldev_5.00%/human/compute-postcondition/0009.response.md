Output State: **`cnt[a[0]]` is 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is 1, `cnt[a[3]]` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(2 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Initially, `cnt[a[3]]` is not present in the dictionary, so it is initialized to 1. Therefore, after executing `cnt[a[i]] += 1`, `cnt[a[3]]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
