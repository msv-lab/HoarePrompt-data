Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block. In this case, since the initial state indicates that `t` is 1 and `i` is 1, and there is no loop or conditional block that would change these values before the `break` statement, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
