You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), an integer representing the size of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the variable `t` represents the count of unique elements in the array `a` that appear exactly once. The variable `i` will be the first index where either `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, or it will be equal to `N` if no such index is found. The variable `tc` will be the total number of test cases plus one. The variable `N` will be the size of the array `a` for the last test case. The variable `a` will be the list of integers for the last test case. The variable `cnt` will be a defaultdict containing the count of each integer present in the array `a` for the last test case. If no element meets the condition to break the inner loop, `i` will be equal to `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in the array. If there are at least two such elements or if an element does not appear at all, it prints the index of the first such element and breaks the loop. If no such element is found, it prints the length of the array. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, N)` and checks the count of each index `i` in the array.
   - If the count of `i` is exactly 1, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of `i` becomes 0, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves two types of moves: Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to `c`, and remove it from `a`. Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The program does not simulate these moves; instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each index in the array `a`.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by checking the count of indices in the array `a` rather than constructing the array `c` based on the moves made by Alice and Bob.
   - The MEX should be calculated based on the final state of `c`, not the intermediate states of `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current logic does not reflect this strategic interaction.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic or compute the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
