Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `t` remains 0, `i` remains 0, and `N` remains greater than 0. This means that either `t` is less than 2 or `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, leading to the execution of the if part where `t` and `i` remain unchanged and `N` remains greater than 0.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `N > 0` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Since `N` remains greater than 0 as per the postcondition, `N` will still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 1, `N` must be greater than 0**
