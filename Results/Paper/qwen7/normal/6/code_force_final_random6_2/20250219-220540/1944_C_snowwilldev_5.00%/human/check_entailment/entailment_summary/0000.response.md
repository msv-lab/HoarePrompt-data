Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The problem specifies that Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, with Alice appending her chosen element to `c` and deleting it from `a`, while Bob only deletes his chosen element from `a`. However, the program does not simulate these turns. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and checks for elements that appear exactly once.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the index of the first element that appears exactly once or the length of the array if no such element exists. This output does not correspond to the MEX of the final array `c` after the game ends.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The current implementation does not reflect these strategic goals.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
