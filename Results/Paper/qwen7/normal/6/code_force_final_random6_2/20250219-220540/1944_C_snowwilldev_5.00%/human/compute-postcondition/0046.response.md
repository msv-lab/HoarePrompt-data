Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 3, `N` must be greater than 3, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, `cnt[a[3]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt[a[3]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
