Output State: **`tc` is 5, `N` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `tc` is incremented to 5 in the initial state. The code `N = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `N`. Since the loop condition ensures that `tc` remains 5, `tc` does not change. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged as there are no operations modifying them within the given code snippet.
