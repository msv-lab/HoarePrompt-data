The loop condition is `k`, which means the loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is greater than 0 but has been updated to `k // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 2 (not part of the loop head)
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not part of the loop head)
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string (not part of the loop head)
- `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` (not part of the loop head)
- `k` is greater than 0 and now equal to `k // 2` (part of the loop head)
- `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1 (not part of the loop head)

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be greater than 0 and now equal to `k // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1**
