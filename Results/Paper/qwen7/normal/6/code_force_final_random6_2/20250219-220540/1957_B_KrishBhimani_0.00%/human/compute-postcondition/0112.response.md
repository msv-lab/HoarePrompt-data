Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`**.

The code `arr = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`. This operation changes the value of `arr` from the original list `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]` to an empty list. The values of the other variables (`i`, `c`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
