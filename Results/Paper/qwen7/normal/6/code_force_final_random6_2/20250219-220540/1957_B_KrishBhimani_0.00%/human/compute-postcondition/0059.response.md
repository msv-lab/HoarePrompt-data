The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero, which is already satisfied since `k` is initially 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the variable `k`.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1**
