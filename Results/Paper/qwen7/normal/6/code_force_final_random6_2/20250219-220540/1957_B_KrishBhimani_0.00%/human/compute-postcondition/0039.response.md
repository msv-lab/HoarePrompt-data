Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1], `c` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables directly. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Since no loop or if statement was specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the indication that a break occurs.
