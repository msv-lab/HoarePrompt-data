Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be non-zero. If `k & 1 == 1`, then `i` becomes 4 and `arr` is updated to include the value 4.**
