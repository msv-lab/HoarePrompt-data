Output State: **`i` is 4; `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4]; `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)]; `c` is 16; `k0` is 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`; `k` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
