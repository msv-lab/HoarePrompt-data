Postcondition: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, `ans` is a list containing the value `-sum(ans)`, `c` is 0. If `c == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
