Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an odd number, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is a list containing the value 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
