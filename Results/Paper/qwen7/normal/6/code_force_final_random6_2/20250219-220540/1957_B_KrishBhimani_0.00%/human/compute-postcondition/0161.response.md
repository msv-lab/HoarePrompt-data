Output State: `i` is 31, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is 32, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824].

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. For each iteration, the variable `ans` appends a new value which is `1 << i`, where `i` is the current element being processed. This operation shifts the binary representation of 1 left by `i` positions, effectively calculating 2^i. The loop continues until all elements in `arr` are processed. Since `arr` contains numbers from 0 to 31, the final list `ans` will contain the values 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^31. After the loop completes, `c` will be equal to the length of `arr`, which is 32, and `i` will be the last element in `arr`, which is 31.
