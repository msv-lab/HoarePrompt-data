Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]; `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)]; `c` is 16; `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 31, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is 32, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824, 0, 0, 0, 0]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
