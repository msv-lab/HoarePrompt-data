Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1` which is a list of strings and converts each string into an integer using `map(int, l1)`. It then assigns these integers to `n` and `k`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains unchanged, and `l1` is still a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string.
