Output: **1**

Explanation:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`.
- `c` is initialized to 2.
- `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by a space. Since `ans` contains only one element, which is `1`, the output will be `1`.
