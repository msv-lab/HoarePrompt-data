Postcondition: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1], `c` is 2, and either `c` is not equal to `n - 1` or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `c == n - 1` is true or false, the values of the variables remain as specified in the if part, indicating that the program will either break out of the loop or continue with the same conditions as defined in the if part.
