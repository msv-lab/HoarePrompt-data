Output State: **`i` is one of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is equal to `n - 1` + 1, `ans` is a list with the element `1 << i` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` (which is `2**i`) to the list `ans`. Since `i` is one of the elements in `arr`, `1 << i` will be a power of 2 corresponding to the value of `i`. The other variables (`arr`, `c`, and the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) remain unchanged.
