Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

The code `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. Since the initial value of `k` is not specified, `k0` will take the same value as `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
