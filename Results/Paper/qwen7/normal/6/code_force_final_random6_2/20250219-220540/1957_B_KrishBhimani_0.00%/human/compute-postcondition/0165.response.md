Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) are processed. The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. For each test case, the function returns a result based on `n` and `k`.**
