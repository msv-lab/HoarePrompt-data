Output State: `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is 32, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824], and `k` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. For each iteration, `ans` is updated by appending `1 << i` (which is equivalent to \(2^i\)) to the list. Since `arr` contains numbers from 0 to 31, the loop will append \(2^0\) through \(2^{31}\) to `ans`. The variable `c` increments with each iteration until it reaches 32, at which point the loop condition `c == n - 1` is met (where `n` is the length of `arr`, which is 32), and the loop breaks. The value of `i` becomes the next element in `arr` after the last iteration, which is 1.
