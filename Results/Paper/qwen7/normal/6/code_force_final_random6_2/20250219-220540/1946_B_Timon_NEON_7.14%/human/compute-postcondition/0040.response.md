Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `new_segment` to a list containing the element at index `i` of `arr` and the value of `i`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `new_segment` will be either `[arr[1], 1]` or `[arr[2], 2]`. The values of `max_segment[0]` and the rest of the list `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
