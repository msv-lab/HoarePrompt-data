Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it seems to be implemented incorrectly.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the accumulation of subarray sums and doesn't properly update the maximum sum.
   - The function should use Kadane's algorithm or a similar approach to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently.

2. **Function 3 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_3` is not defined completely. There is no implementation provided for the function, which is required to calculate the final result.
   - The function signature suggests it should take two parameters (`number` and `quantity`) but the body is empty, indicating it's incomplete.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - The solution should involve calculating the initial sum of the array and then determining how to use the operations to maximize the sum.
   - The provided functions do not seem to address the main problem requirements correctly.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Calculate the initial sum of the array.
- Use the operations to add the sum of subarrays multiple times to maximize the final sum.
- Ensure the final sum is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:
1. Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, you can add the entire array sum `k` times.
3. If `k` is less than the length of the array, you can add the maximum subarray sum `k` times.
4. Handle edge cases where the array might contain only negative numbers.

This would require implementing Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and handling the operations accordingly.
