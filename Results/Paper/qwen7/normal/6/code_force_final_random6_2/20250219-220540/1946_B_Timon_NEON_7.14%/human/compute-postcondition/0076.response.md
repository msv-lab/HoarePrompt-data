Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `segment` and `segments_variants`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `segments_variants` contains at least one element.
   - The first element of `segments_variants` is the initial value of `segment`.
   - If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` still contains at least one element.
   - After the first element of `segments_variants` is used in the loop, `segments_variants` will have one less element (assuming it had at least two elements initially).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `segments_variants` must contain at least one element (since we are starting a new iteration).
   - The first element of `segments_variants` will be the new value of `segment`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`segments_variants` contains at least one element, and the first element of `segments_variants` will be the initial value of `segment`**.
