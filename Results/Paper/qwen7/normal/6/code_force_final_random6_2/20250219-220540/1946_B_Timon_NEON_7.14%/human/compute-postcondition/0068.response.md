Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains a new list where the last element is `max_segment` followed by `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Explanation: The code initializes `total_max_segment` to a list containing `-1`. This does not affect the value of `segments_variants`, which remains unchanged from its previous state. Therefore, `segments_variants` still contains a new list where the last element is `max_segment` followed by `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, and `total_max_segment` is now a list containing `-1`.
