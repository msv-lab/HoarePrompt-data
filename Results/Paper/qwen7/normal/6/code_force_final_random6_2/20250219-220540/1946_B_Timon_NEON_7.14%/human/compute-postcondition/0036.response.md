Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `arr` is a non-empty list; `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on the condition of the if statement.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `max_segment` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to `max_segment[0]`.
- `new_segment` remains an empty list.
- `segments_variants` contains one additional element, which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on the condition of the if statement. Since the condition of the if statement is not specified, both possibilities are considered.
