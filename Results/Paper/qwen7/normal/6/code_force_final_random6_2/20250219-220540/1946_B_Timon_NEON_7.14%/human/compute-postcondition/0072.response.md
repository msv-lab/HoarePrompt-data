Output State: **`segments_variants` contains at least one element, and the first element of `segments_variants` will be the initial value of `segment`; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as `segment`. The precondition that `segments_variants` must contain at least one element and the first element of `segments_variants` will be the initial value of `segment` remains unchanged.
