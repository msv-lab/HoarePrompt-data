Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr` considering the conditions provided, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative, considering whether `new_segment` is truthy or falsy.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is negative, or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if `arr[i]` is non-negative. `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one variant of the segments, either `[max_segment + [i - 1]]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]` and `new_segment[0]` is the sum of its original value (either 0 or the first element of `arr`) and `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is negative, `max_segment[0]` remains unchanged and `new_segment` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
