Output State: **All iterations completed.**

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will hold:

- The variable `i` will be equal to `len(arr) - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in the array `arr`.
- The variable `max_sum` will still be `-1`, as it was initialized and not modified within the loop.
- The variable `new_segment` will be an empty list, as the loop condition `if new_segment:` ensures that `new_segment` is reset to an empty list whenever a new segment is considered.
- The variable `max_segment` will contain the start and end indices of the segment with the maximum sum, where `max_segment[0]` represents the sum of the elements in this segment.
- The variable `segments_variants` will be a list containing all valid segments that meet the criteria specified in the loop, including the final `max_segment` and any `new_segment` that was active before being replaced by `max_segment`.

In summary, after all iterations, the loop will have processed the entire array `arr`, identified the segment with the maximum sum under the given conditions, and stored all relevant segment variants in `segments_variants`.
