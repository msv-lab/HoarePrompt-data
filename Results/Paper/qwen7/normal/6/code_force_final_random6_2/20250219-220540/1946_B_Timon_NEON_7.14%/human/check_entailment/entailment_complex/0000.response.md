### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that inserting the sum of a subarray can significantly increase the array's sum, especially if the subarray has a large positive sum.
   - The optimal strategy often involves selecting subarrays with large positive sums and inserting their sums into the array.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_2`**: This function identifies segments within the array where the sum of elements is maximized. It considers both positive and negative contributions and returns the segment with the maximum starting point. If no valid segments are found, it returns `[-1]`.
   - **`func_1`**: This function simply returns the remainder when the input number is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **`func_3`**: This function is not used in the given code snippet. It seems to be intended for another purpose but is not called in the provided code.

4. **Code Logic**:
   - The main logic is in the loop that iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` to get the segment with the maximum sum.
   - It then calculates the answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to ensure the result is within the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies the segment with the maximum sum.
   - The calculation in the main loop correctly applies the formula to maximize the array sum.
   - The use of `func_1` ensures the result is within the required modulo.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
