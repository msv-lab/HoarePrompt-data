Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains a new list where the last element is `max_segment` followed by `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list consists of `new_segment` concatenated with `[len(arr) - 1]`. The length of `arr` minus one is appended to `new_segment`. The value of `max_segment` remains unchanged and is included as the last element in the list before the newly appended segment.
