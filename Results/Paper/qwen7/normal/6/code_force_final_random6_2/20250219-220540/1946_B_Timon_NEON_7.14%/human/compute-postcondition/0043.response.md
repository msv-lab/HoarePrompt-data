Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `arr` is a non-empty list; `max_segment[0]` is updated to the value of `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`; `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is non-negative, otherwise it remains as the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative.**

This means that the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. The value of `i` remains either 1 or 2. The value of `new_segment` depends on the value of `arr[i]`: if `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, if the first element of `arr` is non-negative, `new_segment` remains as the first element of `arr` and 0. If the first element of `arr` is negative, `new_segment` remains as the first element of `arr`.
