Output State: **`segments_variants` contains a new list where the last element is `max_segment` followed by the length of `arr` minus one.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list consists of `max_segment` (a previously defined variable) followed by the length of `arr` minus one. The initial state of all iterations being completed means that no other variables have been altered, so their states remain unchanged.
