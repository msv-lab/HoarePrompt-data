Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `line` is the next line in the sliced list after 'e'. This means `line` is a string representing a line of text.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - `tokens := line.split()`: This uses the `split()` method on the string `line` to create a list of tokens (words or substrings) from `line`. The result is assigned to the variable `tokens`.
   - `len(tokens)`: This calculates the number of tokens in the list `tokens`.
   - `{*tokens}`: This creates a set from the list `tokens`, removing any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})`: This calculates the number of unique tokens in the list `tokens`.

3. **Expression**:
   - `(len(tokens) - len({*tokens}))`: This expression subtracts the number of unique tokens from the total number of tokens.

4. **Explanation**:
   - If `line` contains no duplicate words, `len(tokens)` and `len({*tokens})` will be the same, resulting in the output being `0`.
   - If `line` contains duplicate words, the difference between `len(tokens)` and `len({*tokens})` will be the count of duplicate words.

Given the initial state and the code, the output will depend on the content of `line`. Since the exact content of `line` is not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) (where tokens is the list of words obtained by splitting line, and len(tokens) is the number of tokens, while len({*tokens}) is the number of unique tokens)**
