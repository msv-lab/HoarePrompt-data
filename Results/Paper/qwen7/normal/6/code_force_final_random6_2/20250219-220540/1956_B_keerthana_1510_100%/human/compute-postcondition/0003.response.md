Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `line` is a string with the value `'e'`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `tokens := line.split()`: This is a walrus operator that splits the string `line` into a list of tokens. Since `line` is `'e'`, `line.split()` will result in a list with one element, `['e']`. So, `tokens` becomes `['e']`.
   
3. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - `len((tokens := line.split()))`: This evaluates to the length of the list `tokens`, which is `1`.
   - `{*tokens}`: This unpacks the list `tokens` into a set, resulting in the set `{'e'}`.
   - `len({*tokens})`: This evaluates to the length of the set `{'e'}`, which is `1`.

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is `(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))`.
   - Substituting the evaluated lengths, this becomes `1 - 1`, which equals `0`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output `0`.

Output: **0**
