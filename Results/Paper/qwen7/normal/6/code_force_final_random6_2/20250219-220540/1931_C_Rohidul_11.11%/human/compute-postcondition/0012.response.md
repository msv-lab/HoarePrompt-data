Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is 3.
   - `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`.
   - `st` is 1 (though this variable is not part of the loop condition).

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The variables involved in the loop condition are `l` and `r`, and the array `a` which is used in the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

4. **Check the Current Values:**
   - `l` is 3.
   - For the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`.

5. **Loop Condition Evaluation:**
   - The condition `l < r` requires `l` to be less than `r`.
   - The condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` requires `a[3]` to be equal to `a[4]`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `l` must be less than `r` and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`.
   - Since `l` is currently 3, `r` must be greater than 3.
   - Additionally, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, and `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`**
