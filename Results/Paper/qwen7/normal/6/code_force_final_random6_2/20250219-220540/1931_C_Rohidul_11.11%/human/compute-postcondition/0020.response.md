Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is equal to `r`
   - `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list
   - `end` is 1
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (so `r` is now `r - 1`)

3. **Determine which conditions need to be satisfied for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l`.
   - Additionally, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - Since `l` is equal to `r`, the condition `r > l` is false because `r` is not greater than itself.
   - The value of `a[r]` is not explicitly given, but we know that `a[r]` should be equal to `a[r - 1]` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To satisfy `r > l`, `l` must be less than `r`. Since `r` is `l - 1`, we need to decrease `l` by 1 so that `l` becomes `r - 1`.
   - The value of `a[r]` should be equal to `a[r - 1]`, but since this is a condition inside the loop body, we don't need to explicitly adjust it here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r` such that `l` is less than `r`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must be less than `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 1, and `r` is decreased by 1**
