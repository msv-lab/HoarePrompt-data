#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 0, 0
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        
        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: l is 0, r is n - 1, st is n - 1, end is 3 * (number of iterations), and ans is either 0 or -n depending on the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then calculates a value \( ans \) based on certain conditions involving the first and last elements of the list and the repetition of adjacent elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of 0 and \( ans \).
