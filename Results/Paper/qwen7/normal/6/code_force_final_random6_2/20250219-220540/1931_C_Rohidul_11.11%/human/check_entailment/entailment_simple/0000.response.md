Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The function iterates over `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization**: Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the array respectively. Two counters `st` and `end` are used to count the number of consecutive elements at the start and end of the array that are equal to their adjacent elements.

3. **Left Counting (`st`)**: The loop increments `l` and adds to `st` until `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]`. This counts the number of consecutive elements at the start of the array that are equal.

4. **Right Counting (`end`)**: The loop decrements `r` and adds to `end` until `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r-1]`. This counts the number of consecutive elements at the end of the array that are equal.

5. **Condition Handling**:
   - If the first element equals the last element, the answer is `r - l - 1`, which is the length of the array minus the counted consecutive elements.
   - If there are no consecutive elements at the start or end and the first and last elements are different, the answer is `len(a) - 1`, which means changing all elements except one.
   - Otherwise, the answer is `r - l`, which is the length of the array minus the counted consecutive elements.

6. **Output**: The function prints the maximum of `0` and `ans`.

Given the logic and the conditions, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering the longest segment of identical elements at the boundaries and the overall length of the array.

Correctness: **True**
