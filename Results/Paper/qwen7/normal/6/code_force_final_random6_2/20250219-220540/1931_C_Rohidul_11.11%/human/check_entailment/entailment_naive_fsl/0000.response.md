Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program does not account for all possible scenarios, particularly when the array has multiple distinct values or when the optimal segment to change is not adjacent.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will incorrectly output `4` because it only checks the boundaries and does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing a different segment. The correct answer should be `4`, but the program might fail to find this optimal solution due to its current logic.

A more comprehensive approach would involve checking all possible segments and their costs to ensure the minimum cost is found.
