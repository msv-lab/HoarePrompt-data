Output State: `l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `l`, `st` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and `l` is now 4, it implies that there were at least 3 consecutive elements in the array that were equal. Therefore, the loop will continue to increment `l` until it reaches `n - 1`, making sure that `l` is no longer less than `r`. Since `r` was initially `n - 1` and hasn't been changed within the loop, `r` remains `n - 1`. The variable `st` keeps track of how many times the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` was met, so after `n - 1` increments of `l`, `st` will be `n - 1`.
