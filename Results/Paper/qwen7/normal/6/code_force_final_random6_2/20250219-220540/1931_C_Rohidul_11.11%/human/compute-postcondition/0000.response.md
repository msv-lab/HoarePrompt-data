Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter.
   - However, since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`.
   - This input should be a positive integer, and it represents the number of test cases.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is valid (a positive integer within the specified range).
   - We don't need to adjust the state of `t` or `n` or the array `a` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **The input must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ input ≤ 10^4**
