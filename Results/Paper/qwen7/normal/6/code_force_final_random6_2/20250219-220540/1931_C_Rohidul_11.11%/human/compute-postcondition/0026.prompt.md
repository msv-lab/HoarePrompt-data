Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. Each iteration increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. This process continues until `l` is no longer less than `r` or the elements at `l` and `l + 1` are not equal. Therefore, when the loop finishes, `l` will be equal to `r`, indicating that there are no more consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, and `st` will hold the count of these consecutive equal elements.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 1, and `r` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` must be less than `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `end` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
