Output State: `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the adjacent elements `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` are equal. Given that the loop has executed three times with `l` increasing by 1 each time, it implies that the first three elements of the array are identical. Therefore, `l` will keep incrementing until it reaches `n - 2`, making `l` equal to `n - 2` and `r` remaining as `n - 1`. The variable `st` increments by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so after `n - 3` iterations (since the loop starts when `l` is 0), `st` will be `n - 3`.
