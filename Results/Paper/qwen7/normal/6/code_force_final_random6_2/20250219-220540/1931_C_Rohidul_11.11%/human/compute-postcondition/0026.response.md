Output State: `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r`, indicating that there are no more consecutive equal elements at the start of the list. The variable `st` will hold the count of these consecutive equal elements, which was incremented each time the loop ran. The variable `end` will be 3, as it was incremented each time the loop condition was met (i.e., for each iteration of the loop).
