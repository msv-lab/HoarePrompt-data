Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. The function processes these inputs and provides some form of output for each test case, though the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
