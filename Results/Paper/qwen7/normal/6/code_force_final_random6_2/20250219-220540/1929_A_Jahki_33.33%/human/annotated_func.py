#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array elements, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `num2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `order` will be incremented each time the condition `a[i-1] >= a[i]` is true. Therefore, `order` will count the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its successor.
    #
    #In summary, the final output state will be a list `a` of integers, an integer `i` equal to `num2`, and an integer `order` that represents the number of adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if no element in the list is greater than or equal to its successor, otherwise it returns `False`.
