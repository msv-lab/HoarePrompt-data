Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, num2):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `num2`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the array elements.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `order` is increased by 1 if `a[2]` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`. If `a[2]` is less than `a[3]`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `num2-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `num2`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (making it 4). Also, since the loop is defined to run up to `num2-1`, `num2` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state**: The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `num2`. The value of `i` becomes 4, and `num2` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `i` is 4, `num2` must be greater than 4**.
