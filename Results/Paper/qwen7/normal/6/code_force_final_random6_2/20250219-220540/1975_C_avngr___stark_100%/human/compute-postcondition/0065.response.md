Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `max` remains as 3, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `temp`, `max`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
