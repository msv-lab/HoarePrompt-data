Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `temp` is now [a[3], a[4], a[5]], `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` is true, or remains `max` (which is initially 0) otherwise, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `temp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` was originally `[a[3], a[4], a[5]]`, after sorting, `temp` becomes `[a[3], a[4], a[5]]` in sorted order. All other variables remain unchanged.
