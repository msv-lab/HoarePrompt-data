Postcondition: `i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 4, `temp` is now [a[7], a[8], a[9]], `max` is the second largest element in `temp`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `temp` is sorted, and if `temp[1]` was greater than the original `max`, `max` is reassigned to `temp[1]`.
