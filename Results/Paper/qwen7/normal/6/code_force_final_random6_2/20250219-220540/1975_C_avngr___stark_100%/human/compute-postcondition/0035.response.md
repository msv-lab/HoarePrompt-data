Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value found among the second elements of all possible consecutive sublists of length 3 within `a`, `n - 2` is 1, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Initially, `n` was 2, but now it is updated to the new input value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
