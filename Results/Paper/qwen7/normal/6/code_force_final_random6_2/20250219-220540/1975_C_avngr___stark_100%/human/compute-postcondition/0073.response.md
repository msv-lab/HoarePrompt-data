Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` is sorted version of [a[2], a[3], a[4]], `max` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**.

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` was initially `[a[2], a[3], a[4]]`, after sorting, `temp` will contain these three elements in sorted order. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `max`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
