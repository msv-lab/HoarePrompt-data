Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value found among the second elements of all possible consecutive sublists of length 3 within `a`, `n - 2` is 1, and `i` is 0.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. However, the specific values of the elements in `a` depend on the input provided by the user, which is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the user input, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
