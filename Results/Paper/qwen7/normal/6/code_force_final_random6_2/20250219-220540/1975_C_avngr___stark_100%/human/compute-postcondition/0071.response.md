Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n - 2` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 2, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, temp is [1, 3, 3], max is 0, t must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**
