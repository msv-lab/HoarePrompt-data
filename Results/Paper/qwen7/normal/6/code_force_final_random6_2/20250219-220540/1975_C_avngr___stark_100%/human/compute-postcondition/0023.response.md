Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`, `n - 2` is less than 1, `temp` is a slice of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 4, and `temp` is sorted. If `temp[1] > max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring that the conditions from the precondition are retained and the effect of the if condition is included.
