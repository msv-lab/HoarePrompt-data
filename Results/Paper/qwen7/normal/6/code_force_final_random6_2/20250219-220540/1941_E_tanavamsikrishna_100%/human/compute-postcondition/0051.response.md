Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells and a positive integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. It updates each element in `row` from index `d` to the end by adding the smallest value found in a min-heap plus one. Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row` list.**
