Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row of the river, ensuring the constraints are met.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set the first support cost to 1.
   - For the first `d` cells, add 2 to each cell's value (since the first and last cells are already set to 0 and we need to ensure the distance constraint).

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - Create a min heap from the first `d` cells.

3. **Processing Remaining Cells:**
   - For each subsequent cell, pop elements from the heap until the current index minus the distance to the last popped index is greater than `d`.
   - Update the current cell's cost to the minimum cost found plus the current cell's value plus 1.
   - Push the updated cost and index back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost:**
   - Return the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to install supports in the row.

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Read the river grid `rows`.

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Row:**
   - Use `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row.

3. **Calculate Total Costs for Consecutive Rows:**
   - Iterate through the calculated costs and find the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Output the Minimum Cost:**
   - Print the minimum total cost.

### Verification

1. **Heap Usage:**
   - The heap is used efficiently to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain distance, ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation logic in `func_1` correctly ensures that the distance between supports is no more than `d` and minimizes the overall cost.

3. **Consecutive Rows:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly iterates through the rows and finds the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the first and last cells being fixed at 0 and the distance constraint being enforced.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in both functions is correct and follows the problem constraints accurately.

**Correctness: True**
