Output State: **`i` is at least `2d + 2`, `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` and now includes `e`, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heappush(min_heap, e)` pushes the element `e` into the min heap `min_heap`. This means the minimum value in `min_heap` before the push was less than or equal to `-2`, and after pushing `e`, `e` is now part of the heap. Additionally, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, meaning the value of `row[i]` is now the sum of `e[0]`, the original value of `row[i]`, and 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
