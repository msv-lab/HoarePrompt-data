You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0. The sum of n⋅m for all sets of input data does not exceed 2⋅10^5. costs is a list of integers calculated by calling func_1(row, d) for each row in rows. total_costs is a list of integers calculated by summing k consecutive elements from costs.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements of `costs` starting from the first element up to the second-to-last element of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is now equal to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain sums of all possible consecutive segments of length `k` within the `costs` list. The loop iterates from the start of `costs` to the point where a segment of length `k` can still fit within the list, hence the condition `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs contains the sums of all possible consecutive segments of length k within the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d (all integers), a list of n lists called rows, and two additional lists called costs and total_costs. It does not return anything.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
