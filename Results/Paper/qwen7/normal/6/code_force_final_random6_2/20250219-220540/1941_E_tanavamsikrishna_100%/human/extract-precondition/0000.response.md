Precondition: **(n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0. The sum of n⋅m for all sets of input data does not exceed 2⋅10^5. costs is a list of integers calculated by calling func_1(row, d) for each row in rows. total_costs is a list of integers calculated by summing k consecutive elements from costs.**
