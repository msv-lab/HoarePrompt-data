Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(d, len(row))`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2d + 3`.
   - `min_heap` contains the tuple `(row[i], i)` where `i` is `2d + 3`.
   - Each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = d` and increments `i` until `i < len(row)`.
   - Since `i` is currently `2d + 3`, we need to check if `2d + 3 < len(row)`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - If `2d + 3 < len(row)`, then the loop will continue.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `2d + 4`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `2d + 4`.
   - The `min_heap` will still contain the tuple `(row[i], i)` where `i` is now `2d + 4`.
   - Each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 4` will be updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `2d + 4`, `min_heap` contains the tuple `(row[i], i)` where `i` is `2d + 4`, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 4` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`**.
