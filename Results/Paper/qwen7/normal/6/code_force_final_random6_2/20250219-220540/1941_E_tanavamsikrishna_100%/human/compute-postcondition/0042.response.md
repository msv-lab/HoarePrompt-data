Output State: `i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2` and the second element `[1]` of the popped element `e` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` for all iterations.

In Natural Language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that the variable `i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2`, and for every element popped from the `min_heap`, the second element `[1]` of the popped tuple `e` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. This condition ensures that the loop terminates when no more elements in the `min_heap` satisfy the condition relative to `i`.
