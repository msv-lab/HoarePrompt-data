Output State: **(n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m; n, m, k, d are assigned the values of the input split by spaces; rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; the sum of n⋅m for all sets of input data does not exceed 2⋅10^5; costs is a list of integers calculated by calling func_1(row, d) for each row in rows; total_costs is a list of integers calculated by summing k consecutive elements from costs.**

This output state reflects that the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` have been assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
