Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.**

The code `z = s.count('mapie')` calculates the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `z`. The values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
