Reasoning:
- The program iterates over each test case, where for each case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
- It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie".
- The logic used to calculate the minimum number of deletions is incorrect. Specifically, the formula `x + y - z` does not correctly account for the minimum deletions needed to remove all instances of "map" and "pie". The variable `z` (count of "mapie") is unnecessary and misleading because it does not directly help in determining the minimum deletions.
- To correctly solve this problem, we should iterate through the string and keep track of whether we have encountered "map" or "pie" and skip the necessary characters to ensure the string becomes beautiful with the minimum deletions.

Given the provided code, the logic is flawed and does not achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **False**
