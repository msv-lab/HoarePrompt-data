Output State: The loop will have executed for all test cases provided. For each test case, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the total number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` across all strings processed, `y` is the total number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` across all strings processed, `z` is the total number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s` across all strings processed, and `num_iterations` is equal to the total number of test cases. The final output will be the sum of `x + y - z` for all test cases.
