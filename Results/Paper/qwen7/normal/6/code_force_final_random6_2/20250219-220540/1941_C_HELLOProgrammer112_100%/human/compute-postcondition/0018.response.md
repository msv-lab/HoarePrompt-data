Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the new string `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0, `a` is reassigned to a new input integer, and `s` is updated to a new string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `y = s.count('pie')` updates the variable `y` to be the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the current string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
