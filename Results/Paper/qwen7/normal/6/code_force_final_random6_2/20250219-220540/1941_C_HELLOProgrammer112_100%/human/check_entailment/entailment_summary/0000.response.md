Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if the logic implemented matches the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements:
- A string is considered "ugly" if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- To make a string "beautiful," we need to remove the minimum number of characters such that neither "pie" nor "map" appears in the string.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Program Logic:
- The program counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie'.
- It then calculates the result as `x + y - z`, where:
  - `x` is the count of 'map',
  - `y` is the count of 'pie',
  - `z` is the count of 'mapie'.

### Analysis:
1. **Counting Substrings**:
   - Counting 'map' and 'pie' separately is necessary because they are separate substrings.
   - However, counting 'mapie' is redundant and unnecessary because:
     - If 'mapie' is present, it already includes both 'map' and 'pie'.
     - Counting 'mapie' would overcount the actual deletions needed.

2. **Calculating Minimum Deletions**:
   - The formula `x + y - z` does not correctly calculate the minimum deletions required.
   - Instead, the correct approach should be to:
     - Remove all instances of 'map' and 'pie' but ensure no overlapping deletions are counted twice.
     - Since 'mapie' covers both 'map' and 'pie', we should only consider the unique occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the string and keep track of deletions needed for 'map' and 'pie'.
   - If 'map' is found, we need to delete at least one character to break it.
   - Similarly, if 'pie' is found, we need to delete at least one character to break it.
   - Overlapping deletions should be handled by ensuring each instance of 'map' and 'pie' is considered only once.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
