Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

The expression `print(x + y - z)` will be evaluated with the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Let's break it down:

- `x` is the count of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the count of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
- `z` is the count of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`.

The expression `x + y - z` adds the counts of 'map' and 'pie' and then subtracts the count of 'mapie'. This subtraction accounts for any instances where 'mapie' is counted in both 'map' and 'pie', ensuring that such instances are only counted once.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this calculation based on the actual content of the string `s`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, and z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s)**
