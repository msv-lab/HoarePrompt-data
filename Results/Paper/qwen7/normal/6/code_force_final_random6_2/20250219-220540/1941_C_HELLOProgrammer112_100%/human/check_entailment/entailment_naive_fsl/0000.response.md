Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not consider overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters. For example, in the input "mapie", the program would count "map" and "pie" separately and output 2, but the optimal solution is to remove only 1 character ('i') to make the string "mpe" which is beautiful. The program also fails to handle cases where "map" and "pie" overlap, such as "mapie", where it should remove fewer characters than it currently does.
