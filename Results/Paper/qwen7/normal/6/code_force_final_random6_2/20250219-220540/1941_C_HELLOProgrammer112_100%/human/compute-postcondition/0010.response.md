Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0; `x` is updated to the count of 'map' in `s`**.

This means that the variable `x` now holds the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
