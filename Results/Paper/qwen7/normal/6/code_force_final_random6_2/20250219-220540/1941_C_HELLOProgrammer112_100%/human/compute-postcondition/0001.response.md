Output State: **`a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which is not specified beyond the fact that `a` is assigned the input integer.
