### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function `func_1` based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- Each test case involves two integers \( n \) and \( x \) where \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \).
- The goal is to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints, where \( k > 1 \).

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` takes an integer \( x \) and returns a list of its divisors in descending order, followed by their corresponding quotients when \( x \) is divided by these divisors, also in descending order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - It then uses `func_1` to find divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It filters these divisors to find those that satisfy the condition \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
3. **Output Handling**: The program ensures that the results are unique by converting the list to a set and then back to a list before printing the length.

#### Correctness Check:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where \( x \geq n \). However, the problem description explicitly states \( 1 \leq x < n \), so this is not a concern.
- The program correctly handles the conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) and filters the divisors accordingly.
- The use of `func_1` to find divisors and filter them based on the given conditions is logically sound.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment was overly cautious and did not fully account for the constraints provided in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided.
