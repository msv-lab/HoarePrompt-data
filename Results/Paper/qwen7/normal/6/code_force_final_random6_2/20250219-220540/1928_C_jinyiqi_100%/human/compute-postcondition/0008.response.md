Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - `output1` is a list containing 1 element which is `i`
   - `output2` is a list containing 1 element which is `int(x / i)` if `x % i == 0`. Otherwise, `i` remains 1, and `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - We need to check if `i` (which will be 3) is still within the range defined by the loop condition, i.e., `i` should be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `output1` and `output2` will remain the same unless the new `i` (which is 3) divides `x` evenly.

Given these steps, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `x` remains the same.
- `i` becomes 3.
- `n` remains the same.
- `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged unless `3` divides `x` evenly.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `x`, we cannot determine the contents of `output1` and `output2` without knowing `x`. However, based on the loop condition, we know that `i` will be 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1 element which is `i`, `output2` is a list containing 1 element which is `int(x / i)` if `x % i == 0`. Otherwise, `i` remains 1, and `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
