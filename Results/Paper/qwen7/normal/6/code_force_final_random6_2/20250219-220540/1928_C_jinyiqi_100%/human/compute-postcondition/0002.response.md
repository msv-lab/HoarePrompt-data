Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Therefore, the value of `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `output2` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, the loop will execute if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than or equal to 1. This condition is always true because \(x\) is at least 1.
   - We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is set to 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `x` (since it affects the calculation of `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`).
- `i` should be set to 1.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output2` is an empty list**.
