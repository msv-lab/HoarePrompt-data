Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts**: 
   - The program calculates the cost for half the number of yogurts and then adds the cost of one yogurt separately. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of using the promotion for the last yogurt if it makes the total cost lower.
   
2. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints `X` before printing the final cost, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Logic for Promotion Cost**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost when buying an odd number of yogurts is flawed. It should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible under the promotion and then add the cost for the remaining yogurt(s).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost without any promotion
        cost_without_promo = n * a
        
        # Calculate the cost with promotion
        # Determine how many pairs can be bought
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_with_promo = pairs * b + remaining * a
        
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_without_promo, cost_with_promo))

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both the regular price and the promotional price.
