Output State: **`i` is 1, `A` is an integer from the input, `B` is an integer from the input, `C` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still set to 1. Therefore, `i` is 1, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are now integers from the input.
