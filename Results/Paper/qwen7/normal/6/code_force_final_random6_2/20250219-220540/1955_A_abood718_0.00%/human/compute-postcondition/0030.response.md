Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 2.
- `A` is an input integer.
- `B` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(A * B)`.

Since `A` and `B` are explicitly defined as input integers, we cannot determine their specific values without additional information. Therefore, the output will be the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are input integers)**
