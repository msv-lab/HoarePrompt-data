Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be the integers input for that specific case. The output of the loop for each test case will depend on the conditions met within the loop:

- If `B * 2 < C`, the output will be `A * B`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the output will be `int(A * C / 2)`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the output will be `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

All other variables outside the loop (not affected by the loop) will retain their initial states from the input.
