Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
3. The program checks whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts at the regular price or at the promotion price:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the total cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible and then adding the cost of the remaining yogurt. This is done by calculating `X = A // 2` (the number of pairs) and then printing `X * C + B` (cost of pairs plus the cost of the remaining yogurt).
4. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.
5. The logic and conditions in the program match the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
