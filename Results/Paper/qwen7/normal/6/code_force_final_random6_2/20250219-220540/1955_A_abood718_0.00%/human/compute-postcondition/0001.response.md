Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0.
