Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `A` is an integer from the input.
- `B` is an integer from the input.
- `C` is an integer from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

Given the formula for `X`, we substitute `X` with `A // 2` in the print statement. Therefore, the print statement becomes:

```
print((A // 2) * C + B)
```

So, the output will be the result of `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
