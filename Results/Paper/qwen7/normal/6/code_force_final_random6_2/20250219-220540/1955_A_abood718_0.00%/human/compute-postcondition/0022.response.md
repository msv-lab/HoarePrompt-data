Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `i` is set to 1.
2. `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, but their specific values are not provided.
3. `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

When the `print(X)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `X`.

Output: **A // 2**
