Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts because `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence starting from 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, the loop will execute until `i` reaches the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Initial Value of `int(input())`**: Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `int(input())` will be this `t`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must start at 0 and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `i` should be 0.
- `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` is `t`**
