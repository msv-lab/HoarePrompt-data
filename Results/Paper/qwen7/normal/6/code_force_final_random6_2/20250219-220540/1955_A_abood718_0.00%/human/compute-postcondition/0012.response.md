Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A` is an odd integer.
   - `B` is an integer.
   - `C` is an integer.
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(X * C + B)`.

Given that `X` is defined as `A // 2`, this means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2. Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will result in an integer that is half of `A`, rounded down.

Therefore, `X * C + B` can be described as:
- `X` is `A // 2`.
- `X * C` is `(A // 2) * C`.
- Adding `B` to `X * C` gives `(A // 2) * C + B`.

So, the print statement will output the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
