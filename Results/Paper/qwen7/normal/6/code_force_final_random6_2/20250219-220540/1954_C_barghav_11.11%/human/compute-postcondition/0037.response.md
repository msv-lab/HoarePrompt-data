Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of the same length, `i` is `len(a)`. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, then `b[i]` is equal to `n`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is now equal to `m`. Otherwise, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, and `b[i]` is equal to `m`.
