Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(a)`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop condition.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(a)`. The loop body updates elements in lists `a` and `b` based on the value of `i`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition specifies that `a` and `b` are lists of the same length, and the elements are updated according to the given rules.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - Since the loop just finished an iteration, `i` was equal to `len(a) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `len(a)` (which is out of bounds), but the loop will stop because `i` will no longer satisfy the condition `i < len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented from its previous value (`len(a) - 1`) to `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` is now equal to `len(a)`, the loop will terminate.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would actually be the termination of the loop) is:

State: **`a` and `b` are lists of the same length, `i` is `len(a)`**
