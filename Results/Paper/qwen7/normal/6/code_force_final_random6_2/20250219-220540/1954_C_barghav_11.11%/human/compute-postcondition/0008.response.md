Output State: **`a` is updated such that the element at index `i` is now equal to `m`; `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; the index `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one; `b[i]` is updated to `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i]` to `n`. The values of `a`, `m`, `i`, and the condition regarding `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `b[i]`.
