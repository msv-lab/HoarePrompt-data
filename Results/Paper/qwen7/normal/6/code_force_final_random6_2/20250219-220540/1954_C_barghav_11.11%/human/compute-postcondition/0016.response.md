Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of the same length. If the index `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the element at index `i` in `a` is updated to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is updated to `n`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` in `a` is updated to `n`, and `b[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `a[i]` (now `n`) and `b[i]`.
