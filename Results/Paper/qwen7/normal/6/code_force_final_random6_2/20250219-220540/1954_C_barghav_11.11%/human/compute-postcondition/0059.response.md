Functionality: **The function takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, and modifies them in place. For the first half of the strings, it ensures that the larger digit is placed in the first string (`a`) and the smaller in the second string (`b`). For the second half, it does the opposite, placing the smaller digit in `a` and the larger in `b`. Finally, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` to the console.**
