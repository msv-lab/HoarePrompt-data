Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes the input strings `a` and `b`, converts them into lists of characters, and then performs the required operations.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - For the first half of the strings (up to the middle), it ensures that the larger digit is placed in `a` and the smaller digit is placed in `b`.
   - For the second half of the strings (after the middle), it ensures that the smaller digit is placed in `a` and the larger digit is placed in `b`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing the first half, it prints the modified string `a`.
   - Then it prints an empty line.
   - Finally, it prints the modified string `b`.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement. Each test case's output consists of two lines, with the first line containing the modified `a` and the second line containing the modified `b`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles strings of varying lengths correctly by only considering up to the middle of the strings for swapping. This ensures that the logic works for both even and odd-length strings.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
