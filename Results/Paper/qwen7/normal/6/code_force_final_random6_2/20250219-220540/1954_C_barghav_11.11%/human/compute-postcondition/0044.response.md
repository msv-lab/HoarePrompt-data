Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list.
- `b` is a list.
- Both `a` and `b` must be of the same length.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Here, `i` is 1, so we need to access the element at index 1 of list `a`. Since the exact contents of list `a` are not specified, we can only refer to the element at index 1 of `a`.

Output: **[element at index 1 of list a]**
