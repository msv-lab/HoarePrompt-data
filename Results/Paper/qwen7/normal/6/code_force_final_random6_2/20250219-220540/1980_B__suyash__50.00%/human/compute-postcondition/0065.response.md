Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` must have at least one element, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]` and remains greater than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables `i`, `l`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for the fact that the execution is now outside the loop or conditional block.
