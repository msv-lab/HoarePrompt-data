Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
- `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]`. Since `i` is 2, `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, so `fav` is `l[2]`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given the information, the print statement will execute and print the string `'YES'` without any additional variables or values being evaluated or printed.
