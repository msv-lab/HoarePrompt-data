Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input string from the user.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
- `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split().
- `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `k` is the third element of the list `b` and it is equal to the value of `n`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
