Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is empty, `res` is 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from list `a`. Initially, `a` contains the first element which is 0. After executing `a.pop(0)`, `a` becomes an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
