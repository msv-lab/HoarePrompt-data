Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 2.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be empty because the loop continues to remove the last element until no zeros are left or the list becomes empty. The variable `res` remains 0 as the loop does not modify it. The variable `i` remains 2 as it is not changed within the loop. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
