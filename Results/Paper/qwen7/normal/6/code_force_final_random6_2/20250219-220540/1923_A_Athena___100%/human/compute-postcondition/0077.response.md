Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 3, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
