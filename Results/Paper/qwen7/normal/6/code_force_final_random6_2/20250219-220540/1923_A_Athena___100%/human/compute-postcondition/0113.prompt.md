Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and it is set to the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `res` is 3, and `i` is 2.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `res` will be the total count of zeros in the list `a`. Since the loop executes up to the last index of the list `a`, the final value of `i` will be the length of `a` minus one. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it means there were at least 3 elements in the list `a`, and the condition inside the loop was met at least 3 times (each time incrementing `res` by 1). If the third element was not zero, then the second element must have been zero, resulting in `res` being 2. However, since we know the loop executed 3 times, `res` must be 3, indicating there were at least 3 zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 3, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `a` has had all its leading zeros removed, and the variable `res` contains the total count of leading zeros that were removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
