Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the beginning of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. After the loop has executed all possible iterations (which would continue until `a` is empty or no more leading zeros), `a` will be empty, and `res` remains unchanged at 0.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element that was 0 but now does not contain 0, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is non-empty and `a[-1]` is not 0, `res` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is non-empty and `a[-1]` is no longer 0, `res` is 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
