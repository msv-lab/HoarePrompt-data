Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(a)`. 

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: 
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts (as per the standard behavior of the `range` function).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0.

4. **Initial State of `a`**:
   - The initial state of `a` is given as an empty list (`a` is an empty list).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `a` is initially an empty list, `len(a)` will be 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)` to be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` must have at least 1 element, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
