Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a[0]` is now equal to `a[1]` (since `a.pop(0)` removes the first element), `res` is 0, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was initially 0, after executing this line, `a[0]` will now be equal to `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
