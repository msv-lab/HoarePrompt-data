Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 3, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will be empty because the loop continues to remove the last element until no zeros are left or the list becomes empty. The variable `res` is incremented each time a zero is found in the list `a`, so it ends up being 3 after three zeros have been counted. The variable `i` is decremented with each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0, as the loop runs as long as there are elements in the list `a`. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
