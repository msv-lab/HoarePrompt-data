Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` must have at least 1 element, `res` is 3, and `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 2, after executing this line, `res` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
