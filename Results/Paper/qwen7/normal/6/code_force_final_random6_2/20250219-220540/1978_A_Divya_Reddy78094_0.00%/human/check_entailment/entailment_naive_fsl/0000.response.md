Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always selects the two largest numbers from the sorted list and adds them together, which may not yield the maximum possible sum of the highest numbers in the two piles.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case: `n = 5`, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]`.

According to the problem description, we need to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the highest numbers in each pile is maximized. A correct division would be:
- Pile 1: `[3, 2]` (sum = 5)
- Pile 2: `[2, 2, 2]` (sum = 6)

Thus, the maximum total number of pages Alice can read is `5 + 6 = 11`.

However, the provided program sorts the list in descending order and simply adds the first two elements, which results in:
- Pile 1: `[3]` (sum = 3)
- Pile 2: `[2, 2, 2]` (sum = 6)

The program outputs `3 + 6 = 9`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence the correctness is **False**.
