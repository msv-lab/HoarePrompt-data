Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `nums` is updated to a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The original list `nums` is replaced with this new list. The other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged.
