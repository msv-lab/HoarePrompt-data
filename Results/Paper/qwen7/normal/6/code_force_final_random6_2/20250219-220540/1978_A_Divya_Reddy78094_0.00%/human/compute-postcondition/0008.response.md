Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is converted from a string input to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integer inputs, converts each input to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The original precondition that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order is no longer valid since the new elements are directly converted from input strings without sorting. However, we know that the elements in `nums` are now integers, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
