### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Alice needs to divide \( n \) books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the highest book in each pile is maximized.
   - To maximize the sum of the highest book in each pile, we should place the two largest books in different piles.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books \( n \) and the number of pages in each book.
   - It sorts the list of pages in descending order.
   - It then prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the two largest books.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest books are at the beginning of the list.
   - Taking the sum of the first two elements gives us the maximum possible sum of the highest book in each pile.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

**Correctness: True**
