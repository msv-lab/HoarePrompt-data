Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string using `split()` and then converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
