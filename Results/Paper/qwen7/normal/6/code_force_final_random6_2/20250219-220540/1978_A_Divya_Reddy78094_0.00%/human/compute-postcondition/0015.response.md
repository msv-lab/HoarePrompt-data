Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting**.

Explanation: The code `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The sorting operation modifies the list `nums` itself, but does not change the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 499, and `n` remains the input integer. The only change is that `nums` is now sorted in descending order.
