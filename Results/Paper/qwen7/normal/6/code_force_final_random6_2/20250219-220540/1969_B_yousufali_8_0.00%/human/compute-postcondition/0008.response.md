Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the condition for executing the loop does not change with each iteration (it always checks if `t > 0`), and we know it executes at least 3 times with this condition being true, it implies that `t` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout all iterations. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0.
