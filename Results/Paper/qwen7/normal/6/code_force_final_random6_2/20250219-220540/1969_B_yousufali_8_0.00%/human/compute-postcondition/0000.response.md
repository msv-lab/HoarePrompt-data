Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, the input is a binary string `s` where 2 <= len(`s`) <= 2 * 10^5 and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the input will be a binary string `s` with specific length constraints. The initial state of `t` being an integer representing the number of test cases remains unchanged, but now `t` holds the actual value of the input integer. The description of the test case inputs (binary strings `s` with specified length and character constraints) is part of the precondition and remains valid.
