You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `s` of integers entered by the user, `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence where an element in `s` is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element (i.e., `n` was greater than 0).
    #
    #In more detail, if during the loop's execution, there were `k` instances where an element in `s` was 0 and `n` was not 0 before that, then `ans` will be `n + k`. If no such instances occurred, `ans` will remain 0. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `s` after the loop completes.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence where an element in s is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
