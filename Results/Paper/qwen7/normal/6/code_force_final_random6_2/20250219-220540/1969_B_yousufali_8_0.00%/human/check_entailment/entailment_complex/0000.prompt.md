Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `s` of integers entered by the user, `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence where an element in `s` is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element (i.e., `n` was greater than 0).
    #
    #In more detail, if during the loop's execution, there were `k` instances where an element in `s` was 0 and `n` was not 0 before that, then `ans` will be `n + k`. If no such instances occurred, `ans` will remain 0. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `s` after the loop completes.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence where an element in s is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers from the user input, counts the number of consecutive non-zero elements, and calculates the sum of 1 plus the count of non-zero elements immediately preceding each zero in the list. This sum is then printed as the final output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the input is a binary string s where 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the condition for executing the loop does not change with each iteration (it always checks if `t > 0`), and we know it executes at least 3 times with this condition being true, it implies that `t` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout all iterations. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an unspecified number of test cases, each represented by a binary string. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of test cases) remains greater than 0.
