Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `s` of integers entered by the user, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence where an element in `s` is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element (i.e., `n` was greater than 0).

This means that `n` will count the number of consecutive 1's encountered, and `ans` will increment by `n + 1` each time a 0 is found after at least one 1 has been counted. If no 0's are found or if no 1's precede any 0's, `ans` will remain 0.
