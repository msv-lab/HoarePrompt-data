Postcondition: `counter` is 3 if `num[i]` is '0' and `num[len(num) - 1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `num[len(num) - 1]` is '0' and `num[i]` is not '0', `counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` is '0' and `num[i]` is '0', or `counter` is 0 if `num[len(num) - 1]` is not '0'. In all cases, `i` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
