Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to `len(num) - 1` (the last index of the sequence `num`). The postcondition states that `counter` is 1 if `num[i]` equals '0' at the starting index, otherwise `counter` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)`, meaning it starts from the last index (`len(num) - 1`) and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches -1.

3. **Adjusting States**: We need to consider how the loop affects the variables `i` and `counter`.

   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` will be reduced by 1.
   - **Variable `counter`**: The value of `counter` is determined by the condition `num[i] == '0'`. If this condition is true, `counter` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0. However, since we are adjusting the state before the loop executes again, we cannot assume the value of `counter` has changed yet. It will remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be reduced by 1 from its current value.
- `counter` will remain unchanged because we are adjusting the state before the loop executes again.

Since `i` was initially `len(num) - 1`, after one iteration, `i` will be `len(num) - 2`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**.
