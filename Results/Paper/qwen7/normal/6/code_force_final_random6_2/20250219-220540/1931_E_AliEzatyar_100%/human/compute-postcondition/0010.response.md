Output State: **`counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0, `i` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that `i` was part of. The value of `counter` remains unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify it. The value of `i` is set to `-1` because it was decremented from `len(num) - 2` and the loop or conditional block was exited before `i` could be decremented further.
