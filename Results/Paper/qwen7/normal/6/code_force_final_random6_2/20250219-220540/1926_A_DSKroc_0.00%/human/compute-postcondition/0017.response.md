Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32.
   - `q` is 0.
   - `ac` is either 1 or 0.
   - `bc` is either 1 or 0.
   - `s` is a non-empty input string.
   - `i` is the second character of `s`.

3. **Determine the next character `i` will be in the loop**:
   - Since `i` is currently the second character of `s`, the next character it will iterate over is the third character of `s`.

4. **Update the state based on the next character `i`**:
   - If the third character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` will be set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `bc` will be set to 1.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `q` remains 0 as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `ac` and `bc` will be updated based on the third character of `s`.
   - `s` remains the same string.
   - `i` will be the third character of `s`.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character of `s`**.
