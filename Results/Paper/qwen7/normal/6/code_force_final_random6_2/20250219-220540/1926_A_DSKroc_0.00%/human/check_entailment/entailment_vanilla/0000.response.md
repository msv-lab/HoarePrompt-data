### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `ac` and `bc`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If `ac` (count of 'A') is greater than `bc` (count of 'B'), it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over each character in the string, updating the counters accordingly.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given test cases correctly, including edge cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (in which case the program should print the character with the higher count, but since the problem specifies distinct strings, this scenario does not occur).

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
