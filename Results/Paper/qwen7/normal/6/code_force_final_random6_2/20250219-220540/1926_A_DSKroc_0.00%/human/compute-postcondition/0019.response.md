Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is 1 (since it was originally either 1 or 0 and now incremented by 1), `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character of `s`**.

The value of `bc` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
