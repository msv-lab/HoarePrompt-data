Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0 (it may have been incremented by 1 in the else part), `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character of `s`.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 32, `q` remains 0, `ac` remains either 1 or 0, `bc` becomes 1 if it was originally 0 (or remains 1 if it was already 1), `s` remains a non-empty input string, and `i` remains the third character of `s`.
