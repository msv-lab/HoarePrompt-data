Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 1, `s` is the original input string, `i` is the last character of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, it means every character in the string `s` has been processed. Therefore, both `ac` and `bc` will be incremented for each 'A' and 'B' (or any other characters not 'A') found in the string, respectively. Given that the output state after the third iteration already shows `ac` and `bc` as 1, and considering the loop processes each character of the string exactly once, `ac` and `bc` will both be incremented for each occurrence of 'A' and 'B' (or any other characters not 'A') in the string. Since the loop has completed all iterations, `i` will be the last character of the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in the original string `s`, `bc` is the total count of 'B' characters in the original string `s`, `s` is an empty string, and `i` is no longer applicable since `s` is now empty.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the range of 1 to 32, `q` is set to `t-1`, `ac` contains the total number of 'A' characters found in the original string `s`, `bc` contains the total number of 'B' characters found in the original string `s`, the string `s` has been fully processed and is now an empty string, and the variable `i` is no longer defined as it refers to the last character of `s`, which is now non-existent.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be the last character of the string `s`. The variable `ac` will hold the total count of 'A' characters in the string `s`, and `bc` will hold the total count of non-'A' characters in the string `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was set initially and was not modified within the loop, and `q` also remains unchanged as it was initialized to the value of `t` and was not altered by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
