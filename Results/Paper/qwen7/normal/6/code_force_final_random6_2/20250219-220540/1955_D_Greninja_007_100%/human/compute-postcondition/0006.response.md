Postcondition: **`ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`.** 

This means that if `sm` (the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. There is no change in `sm` or other variables if the condition `sm >= k` is true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part.
