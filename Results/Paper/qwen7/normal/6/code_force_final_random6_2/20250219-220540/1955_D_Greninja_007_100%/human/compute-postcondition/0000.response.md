Output State: **`cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original integer values such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` sorts the list `b` and then creates a `Counter` object `cb` which counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values and conditions.
