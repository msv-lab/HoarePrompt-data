You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: The final value of `ans` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is `n - m`. The value of `sm` will be the initial value of `sm` minus the total number of times `sm` was decremented (which is `n - m`). The variable `r` will be equal to `n - 1`. The list `ca` will have its elements updated based on the increments and decrements performed during each iteration, and `cb` will remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans`, which is `n - m`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: n, m, and k (integers with specific constraints), and two lists a and b (each containing integers within certain ranges). It returns the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `n - m`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `ans`, which is `n - m`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
