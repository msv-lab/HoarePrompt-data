Output State: **`ans` is 0, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` minus 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `r` is `m`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, and `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ca[a[r - m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `ca[a[r - m]]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
