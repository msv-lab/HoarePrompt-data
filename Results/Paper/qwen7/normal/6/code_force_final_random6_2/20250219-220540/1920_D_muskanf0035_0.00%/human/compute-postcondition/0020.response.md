Output State: `t` is decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is the final integer input for the number of operations read from the last iteration, `q` is the final integer input for the number of queries read from the last iteration, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from the last input split and converted to integers, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x` such that `b ∈ {1, 2}` and `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` after the last iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will be 0 (since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0). The final values of `n` and `q` will be those provided by the last set of inputs. The `queries` list will contain the integers provided as part of the last set of inputs, and `operations` will contain the list of operations read from the last iteration. The `result` will be the output of the function `func_1` applied to the final `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
