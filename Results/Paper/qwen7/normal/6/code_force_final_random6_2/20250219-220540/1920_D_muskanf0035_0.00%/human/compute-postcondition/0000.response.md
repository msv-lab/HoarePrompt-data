Output State: **`t` is an input integer, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, operations is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `t`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
