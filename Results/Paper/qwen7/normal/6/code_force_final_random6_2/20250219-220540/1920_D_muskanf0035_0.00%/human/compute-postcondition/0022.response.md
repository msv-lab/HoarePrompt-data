Functionality: **The function processes multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of the number of operations (`n`), the number of queries (`q`), a list of operations, and a list of queries. For each set, it reads the operations and queries, applies the operations to an initial array, and then answers the queries. The function ultimately prints the results of these queries for each set of inputs. After processing all sets, the function concludes with `t` (the number of sets) reduced to 0.**
