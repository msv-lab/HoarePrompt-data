Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `operations` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `n` is the integer input for the number of operations, `q` is the integer input for the number of queries.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts those elements to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. These integers are then assigned to the `queries` variable as a list. The `operations`, `n`, and `q` variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
