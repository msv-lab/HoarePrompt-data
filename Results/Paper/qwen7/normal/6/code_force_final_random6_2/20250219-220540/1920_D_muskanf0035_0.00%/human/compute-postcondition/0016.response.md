Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a list of these integers. Since the initial values of `n` and `q` are updated to the first and second input integers respectively, `n` and `q` are now specific input integers. The variable `queries` is a list of these integers, which are obtained from the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
