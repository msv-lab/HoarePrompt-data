Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `n` is updated to the value of the first input integer, `q` is updated to the value of the second input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively. The values of `t`, `queries`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial state.
