Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the operations. Specifically, when an operation of type 2 is performed, it should append `x` copies of the current array to itself. However, the current implementation only appends one copy of the current array `x` times, which is incorrect.

2. **Query Handling**: The function `func_1` calculates the result for each query using modulo with the length of the current array. This approach works for small arrays but will fail for large arrays due to the way the array grows exponentially.

3. **Efficiency Issues**: The solution does not efficiently handle the exponential growth of the array, leading to potential memory and performance issues for large values of `n`.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to keep track of the structure of the array without actually constructing it, since the array can grow very large. Hereâ€™s a more efficient approach:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the structure of the array
    array_size = 0
    last_op_type = None
    last_op_value = 0
    result = []

    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            # Append a new element
            array_size += 1
            last_op_type = op_type
            last_op_value = value
        else:
            # Append x copies of the current array
            array_size *= value
            last_op_type = op_type
            last_op_value = value

    for k in queries:
        if last_op_type == 1:
            # Directly append the last element
            result.append(last_op_value)
        else:
            # Find the position in the last segment
            pos = k % array_size
            if pos < last_op_value:
                result.append(last_op_value)
            else:
                result.append(queries[0])

    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution keeps track of the size and the last operation type and value, allowing it to handle the queries efficiently even for large arrays.
