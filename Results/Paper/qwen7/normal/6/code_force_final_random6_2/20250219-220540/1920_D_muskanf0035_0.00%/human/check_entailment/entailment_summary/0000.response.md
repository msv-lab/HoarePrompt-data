Reasoning:
1. The problem involves processing a series of operations on an initially empty array and answering queries about the array's elements.
2. The `func_1` function is responsible for performing the operations and answering the queries. It correctly handles both types of operations:
   - Appending an integer to the array.
   - Extending the array by appending `x` copies of itself.
3. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
4. Given the problem constraints and the execution summaries, both functions appear to be implemented correctly and should handle the operations and queries as required.

Correctness: **True**
