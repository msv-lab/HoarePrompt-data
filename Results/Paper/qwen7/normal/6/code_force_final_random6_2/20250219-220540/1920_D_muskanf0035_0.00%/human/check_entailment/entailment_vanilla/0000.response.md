Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `array` and an empty list `result` are initialized.
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation in `operations`, if the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, the entire `array` is extended by repeating itself `value` times.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query `k` in `queries`, the `k`-th element of `array` (considering 1-based indexing) is computed using `(k - 1) % len(array)` and appended to `result`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The operations are read and stored in a list of lists `operations`.
   - The queries are read and stored in a list `queries`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments.
   - The result from `func_1` is printed.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles appending elements and extending the array as specified.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the modulo operation used in handling queries. Specifically, the modulo operation might not correctly handle large values of `k` when the length of `array` is very small compared to `k`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to wrap around the index in the array. This is generally correct for finding the `k`-th element in a circular array, but it assumes that the length of the array is always non-zero and correctly reflects the current state of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that there will be at least one operation of the first type before any operation of the second type, so the array will never be empty when handling queries.
   - The modulo operation should work correctly within the constraints provided.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to be correct. The modulo operation ensures that even if `k` is larger than the current length of the array, it wraps around correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
