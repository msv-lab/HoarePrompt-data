Output State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 6, 18], `i` is 5**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `dp`. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp[-1]` is 6, `dp[-2]` is 1, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{new element} = (6 + 2 \times (4 - 1) \times 1) \% (7 + 10^9) = (6 + 2 \times 3 \times 1) \% (7 + 10^9) = (6 + 6) \% (7 + 10^9) = 12 \% (7 + 10^9) = 12 \]

Since the modulus operation does not change the value when the number is less than the modulus, the new element is 12. However, since the list `dp` was updated with the new element, the list now contains `[1, 6, 18]` (as the previous last element 6 was replaced by 18). Also, `i` is incremented to 5.
