You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The pairs (r_i, c_i) represent the positions of the rooks placed by the player in the first k moves, and it is guaranteed that these moves and their mirrored counterparts by the computer are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: Output State: `dp` is a list containing [498, 10302], `i` is 10.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break down the process:
    #
    #1. The loop starts with `dp = [1, 1]`.
    #2. For each iteration, the new element added to `dp` is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`, and the oldest element in `dp` is removed.
    #3. After the first iteration (`i=3`), `dp` becomes `[1, 6]`.
    #4. After the second iteration (`i=5`), `dp` becomes `[6, 18]`.
    #5. After the third iteration (`i=6`), `dp` becomes `[18, 102]`.
    #
    #Continuing this pattern up to `i=10`:
    #
    #- For `i=7`: 
    #  \[
    #  dp[1] = (102 + 2 * (7 - 1) * 6) \% 1000000007 = 102 + 72 = 174
    #  \]
    #  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[174]`.
    #
    #- For `i=8`: 
    #  \[
    #  dp[1] = (174 + 2 * (8 - 1) * 18) \% 1000000007 = 174 + 252 = 426
    #  \]
    #  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[426]`.
    #
    #- For `i=9`: 
    #  \[
    #  dp[1] = (426 + 2 * (9 - 1) * 102) \% 1000000007 = 426 + 1632 = 2058
    #  \]
    #  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[2058]`.
    #
    #- For `i=10`: 
    #  \[
    #  dp[1] = (2058 + 2 * (10 - 1) * 426) \% 1000000007 = 2058 + 3528 = 5586
    #  \]
    #  Removing the first element, `dp` becomes `[5586]`.
    #
    #Continuing this process until `i=10`, we find that the final `dp` list after all iterations is `[498, 10302]`.
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns 10302
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. It returns the integer 10302.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 10302


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
