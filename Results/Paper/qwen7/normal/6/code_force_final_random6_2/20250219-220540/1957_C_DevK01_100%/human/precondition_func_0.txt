t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The pairs (r_i, c_i) represent the positions of the rooks placed by the player in the first k moves, and it is guaranteed that these moves and their mirrored counterparts by the computer are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
