Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to t (inclusive) with every second element reversed, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`. This means that starting from index 0, every second element (i.e., elements at even indices) in the list `a` will be reversed. For example, if `a` was originally `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, after executing the code, `a` would become `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
