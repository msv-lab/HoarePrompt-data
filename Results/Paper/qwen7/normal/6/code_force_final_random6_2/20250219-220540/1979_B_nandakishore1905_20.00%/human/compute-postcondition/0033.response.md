Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the binary string representation of the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and assigns this length to `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
