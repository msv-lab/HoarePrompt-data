You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be equal to `t`, `n` and `m` will be the last pair of input integers provided, `k` will be the absolute difference between the last `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, then `n` is 0 and `m` is odd. In all other cases, `l` will be the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` will be the length of `l`, and `q` will be \(2^{(p - 1)}\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (which are named `x` and `y` in the problem).
   - This part is also correct.

3. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - It calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`.
   - This is correct as it needs to compare the values of `x` and `y`.

4. **Checking if `k` is a Power of Two**:
   - It checks if `k & (k - 1) == 0`. This condition is true if `k` is a power of two.
   - If `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`. This logic is incorrect because the problem asks for the length of the longest common subsequence, not just the value of `k`.

5. **Special Cases for `n` and `m`**:
   - If `n` is `0` and `m` is odd, it prints `1`.
   - If `n` is `0` and `m` is even, it prints `2`.
   - These special cases are incorrect because they do not correctly determine the length of the longest common subsequence.

6. **Binary Representation Logic**:
   - It converts `k` to its binary representation and counts the number of leading zeros.
   - It then calculates `q` as `2 ** (p - 1)` and prints `k - q`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the length of the longest common subsequence.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand the properties of XOR and how it affects the sequences. The key observation is that the longest common subsequence of `a_n = n \oplus x` and `b_n = n \oplus y` is determined by the number of differing bits between `x` and `y`.

Here is the correct approach:
1. Convert `x` and `y` to their binary representations.
2. Count the number of differing bits between `x` and `y`.
3. The number of differing bits gives the length of the longest common subsequence.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
