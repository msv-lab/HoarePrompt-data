Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is equal to `t`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `int(input())`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `t`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `t + 1`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

5. **Post-Condition for the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be `t + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`**.
