Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is `t + 1`
   - `n` is the first input integer
   - `m` is the second input integer
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`
   - If `k` is a power of 2, then `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
   - Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain as defined initially.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` (which is incremented in each iteration), we need to update `i` to reflect the next iteration.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` are not affected by the loop and remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 2`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, if `k` is a power of 2, then `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain as defined initially.**
