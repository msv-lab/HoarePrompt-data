Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, then `n` is 0 and `m` is odd. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.
