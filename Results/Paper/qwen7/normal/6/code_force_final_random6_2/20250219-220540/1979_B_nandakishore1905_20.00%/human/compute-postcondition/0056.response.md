Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases (t) where each case involves two distinct non-negative integers (x and y). For each test case, it returns either 'x < y', 'x > y', or 'x == y' based on the comparison of x and y.**

Given the constraints, the function seems to handle multiple test cases (t) where it compares two distinct non-negative integers (x and y) within each case and returns the result of the comparison.
