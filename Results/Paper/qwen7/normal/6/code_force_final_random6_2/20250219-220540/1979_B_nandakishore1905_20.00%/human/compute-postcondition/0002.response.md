Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

In this state, the variable `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, while the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
