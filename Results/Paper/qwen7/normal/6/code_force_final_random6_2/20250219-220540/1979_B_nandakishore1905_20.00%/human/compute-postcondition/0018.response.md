Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 ** (p - 1)` to the variable `q`. Here, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
