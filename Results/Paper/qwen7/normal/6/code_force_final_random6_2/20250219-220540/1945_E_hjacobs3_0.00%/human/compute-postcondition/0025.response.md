Based on the initial state provided:

- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
- `l` is either 0 or a value such that there are no elements in the sublist `array[l:r+1]` that are greater than or equal to `find`.
- `r` is either `n-1` or a value such that there are no elements in the sublist `array[l:r+1]` that are less than `find`.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the `array`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1` without referencing any of the other variables or their values.

Output: **1**
