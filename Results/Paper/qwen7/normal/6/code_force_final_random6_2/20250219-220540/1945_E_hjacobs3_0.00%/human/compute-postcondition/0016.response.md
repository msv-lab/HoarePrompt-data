Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while l <= r`. This means the loop condition depends on the values of `l` and `r`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: 
   - If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is set to `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `r` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l <= r` must still hold true.

4. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `mid` is equal to `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is set to `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `r` remains unchanged.

5. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` becomes `mid - 1`. For the loop to continue, `l` must still be less than or equal to `mid - 1`.
     - Therefore, `l <= mid - 1` must hold true.
   - If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1`. For the loop to continue, `mid + 1` must still be less than or equal to `r`.
     - Therefore, `mid + 1 <= r` must hold true.

6. **Combine the Conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be satisfied:
     - `l <= mid - 1` (if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`)
     - `mid + 1 <= r` (if `array[mid]` is less than `find`)

7. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that either of the above conditions holds true for the next iteration.
   - Since `mid` is defined as `(l + r) // 2`, we can express the conditions in terms of `l` and `r`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`mid` is equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1` or `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`**.
