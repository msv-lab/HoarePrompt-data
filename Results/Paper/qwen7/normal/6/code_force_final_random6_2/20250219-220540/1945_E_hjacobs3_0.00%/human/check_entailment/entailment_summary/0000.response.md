Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is flawed. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized incorrectly, and the conditions inside the while loop are also incorrect. This will not properly locate the target value `x` in the permutation.

2. **Swapping Elements**: The program only checks if the middle element is the target value `x` and does not consider the possibility of rearranging the array through swaps. The provided code does not perform any swaps and simply returns the index of the target value if found, or `0` if not found.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` should output the required number of swaps and the indices involved in those swaps. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program cannot achieve the goal of rearranging the permutation using at most two swaps so that the binary search finds the target value `x`.

Correctness: **False**
