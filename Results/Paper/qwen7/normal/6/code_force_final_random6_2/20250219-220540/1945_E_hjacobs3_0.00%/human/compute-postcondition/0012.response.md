Output State: **`mid` is equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2; `r` is `mid` - 1**

Explanation: The initial state sets `mid` to (`l` + `r`) // 2. The code then updates `r` to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged from its initial state because it is not reassigned. Therefore, `mid` is still equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2, and `r` is updated to `mid - 1`.
