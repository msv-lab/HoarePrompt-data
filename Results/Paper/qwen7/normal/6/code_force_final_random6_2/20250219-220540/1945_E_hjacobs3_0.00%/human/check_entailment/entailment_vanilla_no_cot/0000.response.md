Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the correct number `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing the necessary swaps. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The loop should continue until `l` and `r` converge to the exact position where `x` should be placed. The current implementation only checks if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, which does not guarantee that the correct position is found.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic in the `func_1` function is also flawed. It only checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array and prints `1`. This does not account for the possibility that `x` might already be at the correct position (`l`), or that additional swaps may be needed.

To fix these issues, the binary search should correctly identify the position where `x` should be placed, and the swapping logic should ensure that the correct number is moved to that position with at most two swaps. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Perform binary search to find the correct position for x
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] >= x:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    
    # Check if x is already at the correct position
    if array[l] == x:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Find the correct position for x
        correct_pos = array.index(x)
        
        # Swap x to its correct position
        if correct_pos < l:
            print(2)
            print(correct_pos + 1, l + 1)
            print(correct_pos + 1, l - 1)
        elif correct_pos > l:
            print(2)
            print(correct_pos + 1, l + 1)
            print(correct_pos - 1, l + 1)
        else:
            print(1)
            print(correct_pos + 1, l + 1)
    
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search correctly identifies the position for `x` and performs the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct position with at most two swaps.
