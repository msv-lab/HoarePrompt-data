You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is either 0 or a value such that there are no elements in the sublist `array[l:r+1]` that are greater than or equal to `find`; `r` is either n-1 or a value such that there are no elements in the sublist `array[l:r+1]` that are less than `find`; `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `l` and `r` will define a range within the original array where no element is equal to or greater than `find` (if `l > r`), or `l` and `r` will point to the boundaries of the subarray where `find` could potentially reside (if `l <= r`).
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string, and the second string is also the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` and `r` define a range within the original array where no element is equal to or greater than `find` (if `l > r`), or `l` and `r` point to the boundaries of the subarray where `find` could potentially reside (if `l <= r`); `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. Moreover, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: both strings are the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string, and the second string is also the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
