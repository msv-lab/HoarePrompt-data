Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is 0; `r` is `mid` - 1; `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2; the value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**

Explanation: The code sets `r` to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is initially calculated as `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, the new value of `r` is now `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
