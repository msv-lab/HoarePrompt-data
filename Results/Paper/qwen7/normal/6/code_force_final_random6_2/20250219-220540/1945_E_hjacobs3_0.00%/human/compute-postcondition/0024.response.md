Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is either 0 or a value such that there are no elements in the sublist `array[l:r+1]` that are greater than or equal to `find`; `r` is either n-1 or a value such that there are no elements in the sublist `array[l:r+1]` that are less than `find`; `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the `array`.**
