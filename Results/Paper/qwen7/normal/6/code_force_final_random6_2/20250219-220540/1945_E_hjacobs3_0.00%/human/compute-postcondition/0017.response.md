Output State: **`mid` is equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1` or `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r`. The conditions involving `l` and `r` remain unchanged because the code does not modify these variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
