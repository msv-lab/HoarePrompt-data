Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces, `i` is the first character of the original string `s`, and `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `isreverse` remains unchanged if `newstr` is not equal to `s`, otherwise `isreverse` becomes equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, `isreverse` remains unchanged.**
