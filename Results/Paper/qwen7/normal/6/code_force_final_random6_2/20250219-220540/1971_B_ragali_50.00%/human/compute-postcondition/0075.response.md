Postcondition: **The set `a` now contains all unique characters from the string `s`, `i`, `t`, and `isreverse` remain unchanged; `isreverse` is the reversed version of the string `s`. The new string `newstr` is equal to the original string `s`, and the current value of `isreverse` is not equal to `s`.**
