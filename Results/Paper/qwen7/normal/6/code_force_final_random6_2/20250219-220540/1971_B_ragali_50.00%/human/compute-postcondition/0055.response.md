Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `i` is the last character of `s`, `a` is a set containing each unique character from `s` once, and `isreverse` remains unchanged.** 

This means that after the if-else block executes, the string `s` will still be the same as it was initially (without leading or trailing spaces), and the variable `i` will be the last character of `s`. The set `a` will contain every unique character from `s`, and the variable `isreverse` will remain unchanged from its initial state. Whether the condition in the if statement (`len(a) > 1`) is true or false, these conditions hold.
