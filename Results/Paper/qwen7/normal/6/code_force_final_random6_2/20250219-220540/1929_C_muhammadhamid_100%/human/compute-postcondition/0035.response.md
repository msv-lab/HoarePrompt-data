Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the number of iterations specified by `x`.
- `x` retains its initial value from the input (`new_x`).
- `s` is equal to `x * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`.

However, the value of `s` is not explicitly given, and the value of `a` is also not provided. Since these values are necessary to determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to express the output in terms of these variables.

The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints either "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

Given this, the output will depend on the relationship between `a` and `s`.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= s else 'No'**
