Output State: `i` is equal to the number of iterations specified by `x`, `x` retains its initial value from the input (new_x), and `s` is equal to `x * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x` which was set initially, `x` will still hold the value it had before the loop started, and `s` will be the result of multiplying `x` by the expression `(s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`.
