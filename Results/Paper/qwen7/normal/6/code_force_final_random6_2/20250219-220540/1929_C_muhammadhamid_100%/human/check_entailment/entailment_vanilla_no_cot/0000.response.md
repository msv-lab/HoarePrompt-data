Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Strategy for Winning Coins**: The problem requires Sasha to be able to win any number of coins, meaning he needs a strategy that guarantees he can increase his coins to any desired amount `n` given the constraints of the game.

2. **Current Solution Logic**:
   - The loop in the provided code calculates `s` which seems to be an attempt to compute how many coins Sasha can accumulate after `x` consecutive losses. However, this calculation does not directly address the requirement of being able to win any number of coins.
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` inside the loop is not correctly reflecting the strategy needed to ensure Sasha can accumulate enough coins.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To ensure Sasha can win any number of coins, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses the maximum allowed number of times (`x` times). After those losses, Sasha should be able to recover and win back enough coins to reach any desired amount `n`.
   - A correct approach would involve calculating the minimum number of coins required to recover from `x` consecutive losses and then checking if Sasha can eventually reach any desired amount `n`.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to recover after x consecutive losses
        min_coins_needed = (k ** x - 1) // (k - 1)
        print('Yes' if a >= min_coins_needed else 'No')

func()
```

This revised solution correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to recover after `x` consecutive losses and checks if Sasha initially has enough coins to start this recovery process.
