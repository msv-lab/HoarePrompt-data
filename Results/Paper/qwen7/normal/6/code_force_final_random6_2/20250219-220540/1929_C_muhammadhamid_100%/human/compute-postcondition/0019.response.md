Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
   - `x` must be at least 4.
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `s` is 4.
   - `i` is 4.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` remains the same: an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
   - `x` remains the same: must be at least 4.
   - `a` remains the same: an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `s` remains the same: 4.
   - `i` is now 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` must be at least 4, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 4, `i` is 5**
