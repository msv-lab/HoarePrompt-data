Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `x` is `new_x`.
   - `s` is `2 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 2, after the next iteration, `i` will become 2 or 3 respectively.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than 3 (since `i` can be 2 or 3).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (1 or 2), so it will be 2 or 3.
   - `x` must remain `new_x` and must be greater than 3.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `x` is `new_x`, `s` is `2 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`**
