Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine whether Bob can form another rectangle. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 6`

According to the problem description, from a `2x6` rectangle, Bob can cut it into two `2x3` rectangles and then form a `4x3` rectangle, which is different from the original `2x6` rectangle. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return "No" because `b` (which is 6) is even.

To fix this, the function needs to check if either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1, as this would allow Bob to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and potentially form a new one. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('yes' if a > 1 and b > 1 and (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0) else 'no')
```

This corrected version ensures that if either dimension of the rectangle is even and greater than 1, Bob can form another rectangle.
