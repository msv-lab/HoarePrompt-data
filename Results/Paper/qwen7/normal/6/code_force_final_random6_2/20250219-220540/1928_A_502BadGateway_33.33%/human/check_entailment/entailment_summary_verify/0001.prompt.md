You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. It checks whether `b` is an even number and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The function checks if `b % 2 == 0` (i.e., if `b` is even).
   - If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`.
   - If `b` is odd, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - According to the problem, Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The key observation here is that if `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal width (`a x (b/2)`), and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle of dimensions `(2a x (b/2))` or `(a x b)`, which is different from the original rectangle.
   - If `b` is odd, no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, he will end up with two rectangles that can only be rearranged to form the original rectangle or its rotation.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly identifies whether `b` is even or odd.
   - However, the function should return `'Yes'` if `b` is even (since a new rectangle can be formed) and `'No'` if `b` is odd (since no new rectangle can be formed).

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the result using lowercase letters ('yes' or 'no'), which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It should return `'Yes'` when `b` is even and `'No'` when `b` is odd. The current implementation returns `'no'` when `b` is even, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```
