### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Given Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

#### Annotated Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```
- The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even. If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`, otherwise `'no'`.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient. It fails to consider cases where `a` is even and greater than 1, allowing Bob to form another rectangle by cutting along the `a` side.

#### Corrected Version:
- The corrected version provided in the assessment is:
  ```python
  for _ in range(int(input())):
      (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
      print('yes' if a > 1 and b > 1 and (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0) else 'no')
  ```

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The corrected version checks if either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1, ensuring that Bob can always form another rectangle if either dimension is even and greater than 1.

2. **Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 1`  
     - Both dimensions are 1, so no cuts can be made. The program should return "No".
   - **Test Case 2:** `2 1`  
     - Only one dimension is even, but both dimensions are 1, so no cuts can be made. The program should return "No".
   - **Test Case 3:** `2 6`  
     - Both dimensions are even, so Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. The program should return "Yes".
   - **Test Case 4:** `3 2`  
     - One dimension is even, so Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. The program should return "Yes".
   - **Test Case 5:** `2 2`  
     - Both dimensions are even and greater than 1, so Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. The program should return "Yes".
   - **Test Case 6:** `2 4`  
     - Both dimensions are even, so Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. The program should return "Yes".
   - **Test Case 7:** `6 3`  
     - One dimension is even, so Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. The program should return "Yes".

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all cases, and the corrected version provided in the assessment fixes this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is incorrect according to the problem statement, and the corrected version provided in the assessment is correct.
