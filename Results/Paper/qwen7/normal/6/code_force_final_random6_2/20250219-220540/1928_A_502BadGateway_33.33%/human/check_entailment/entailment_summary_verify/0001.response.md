### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem description step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The function checks if `b % 2 == 0` (i.e., if `b` is even).
   - If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`.
   - If `b` is odd, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - According to the problem, Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The key observation here is that if `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal width (`a x (b/2)`), and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle of dimensions `(2a x (b/2))` or `(a x b)`, which is different from the original rectangle.
   - If `b` is odd, no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, he will end up with two rectangles that can only be rearranged to form the original rectangle or its rotation.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` currently returns `'no'` when `b` is even, which is incorrect. It should return `'Yes'` when `b` is even.
   - The function should return `'No'` when `b` is odd, which is correct.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the result using lowercase letters ('yes' or 'no'), which matches the problem requirements.

### Corrected Program:
The original program should have been:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```

### Final Answer:
The original program is incorrect because it returns `'no'` when `b` is even, which is the opposite of what it should do. Therefore, we need to correct the function to return `'Yes'` when `b` is even.

Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```

Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1` was implemented incorrectly. The corrected program should return `'Yes'` when `b` is even, and `'No'` when `b` is odd.
