### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - The key points are:
     - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and greater than 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over test cases and calls `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of dimensions.
   - `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if `b` is even, otherwise 'no'.
   - This logic is insufficient because it only checks if `b` is even, missing the cases where `a` is even and greater than 1.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks if `b` is even but fails to consider the case where `a` is even and greater than 1.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not handle all cases correctly.
   - The suggested correction in the original assessment is to check if either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1.

5. **Verification of the Suggested Correction**:
   - The suggested correction is:
     ```python
     for _ in range(int(input())):
         (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
         print('yes' if a > 1 and b > 1 and (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0) else 'no')
     ```
   - This correction ensures that if either dimension is even and greater than 1, the function returns 'yes', which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate, and the suggested correction is correct. Therefore, the given program, when corrected, meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
