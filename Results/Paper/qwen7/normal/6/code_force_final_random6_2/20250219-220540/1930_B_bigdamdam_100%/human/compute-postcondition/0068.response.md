Output State: **`ind` is 8, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[10]` is `n-2`**.

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, making it 8. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
