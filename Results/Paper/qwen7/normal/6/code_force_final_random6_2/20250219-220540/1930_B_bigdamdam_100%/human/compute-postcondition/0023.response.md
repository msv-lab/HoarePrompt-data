Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1000; `i` is 3; `p[3]` is `ind`; `ind` is 5**

Explanation: The initial value of `ind` is `p[3]`, which is `ind`. The code `ind += 2` increments `ind` by 2, so `ind` becomes `ind + 2`, which simplifies to 5 since `ind` was initially `ind`. All other variables remain unchanged.
