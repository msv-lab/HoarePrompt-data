Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the input value, which we'll denote as `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `ind` is 9
   - `i` is 7
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `p[3]` is 3
   - `p[5]` is 5
   - `p[7]` is 7

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(int(input()))`, meaning it runs `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, `ind` is incremented by 2, and the current value of `ind` is assigned to `p[i]`.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Calculate the next state**:
   - Since `i` is 7 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 8.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given that `ind` is 9 and it increments by 2 each time, the next value of `ind` would be 11.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to 8.
   - The variable `ind` will be set to 11.
   - The value of `ind` (which is 11) will be assigned to `p[8]`.

6. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 8, the loop will continue if `n > 8`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ind` is 11, `i` is 8**.
