Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ind` is `ind - 2`, `p[3]` is `ind - 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ind - 2` to `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `p[3]` is updated to `ind - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
