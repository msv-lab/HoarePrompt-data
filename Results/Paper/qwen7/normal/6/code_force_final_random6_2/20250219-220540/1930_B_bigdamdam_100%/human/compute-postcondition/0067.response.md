Output State: **`ind` is `n-2`, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[10]` is `n-2`**.

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` (which is 10) to the value of `ind` (which is `n-2`). All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
