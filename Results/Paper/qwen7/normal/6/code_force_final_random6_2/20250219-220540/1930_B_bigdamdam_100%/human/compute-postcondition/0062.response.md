Output State: **`ind` is `n`, `i` is 8, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The line `ind = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ind`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged. Since `n` is an input integer, its specific value is not known, but it is referenced as `n`. The list `p` retains its original state, being a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
