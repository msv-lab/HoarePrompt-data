Output State: `ind` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[12]` is `8`, and every second index starting from 8 up to but not including `n` will contain values decrementing by 2 from `n` to 6.

This means that if the loop completes all its iterations, the list `p` will have values set at indices 8, 12, 14 (if `n` is at least 14), and so on, decrementing by 2 from `n` down to 6. The variable `ind` will be 6, and `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n`.
