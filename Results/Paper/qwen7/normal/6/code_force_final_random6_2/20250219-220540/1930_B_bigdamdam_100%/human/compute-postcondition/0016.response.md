Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n` (if `n` is even), `n` must be greater than or equal to the largest even number less than or equal to 1000, `ind` is 1, `p[0]` is 1, `p[2]` is -1, ..., `p[n-2]` is `-2 * ((n // 2) * 2) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ind` is calculated as `1 + n % 2`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to the largest even number less than or equal to 1000, `n` is even. For even `n`, `n % 2` is 0, so `ind` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`.
- All elements in the list `p` from index 0 to `n-2` are set to the corresponding value of `ind` adjusted by the number of iterations completed. Since `ind` is 1, `p[0]` is 1, `p[2]` is 1 - 2 = -1, and so on until `p[n-2]` which is 1 - 2 * ((n // 2) * 2) + 1.
