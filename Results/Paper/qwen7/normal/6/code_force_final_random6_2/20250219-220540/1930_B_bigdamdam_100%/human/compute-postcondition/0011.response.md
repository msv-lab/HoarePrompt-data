Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(0, n, 2):`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `ind` is `ind - 4`.
   - `p[3]` is `ind - 4`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes values 0, 2, 4, etc., until it reaches or exceeds `n`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than 5.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 5.

7. **Consider other variables**:
   - `t`, `ind`, and `p[3]` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `ind` is `ind - 4`, `p[3]` is `ind - 4`**
