Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
   - `ind` is 8
   - `i` is 10
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10
   - `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, and `p[10]` is `n-2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in steps of 2 from 0 to `n-1`. The loop condition is `i < n`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 10.

5. **Determine if the loop can continue**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next possible value for `i` would be 12 (if `i` was 10, then `i+2 = 12`). For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is 10, the loop can continue as long as `n > 10`.

6. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the states of `i` and `n` for the next iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` will be 12. The value of `n` remains the same unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

7. **Update the list `p`**: The list `p` does not change based on the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust the list `p` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is 12
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 10

The final state is:
State: **`ind` is 8, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[10]` is `n-2`**
