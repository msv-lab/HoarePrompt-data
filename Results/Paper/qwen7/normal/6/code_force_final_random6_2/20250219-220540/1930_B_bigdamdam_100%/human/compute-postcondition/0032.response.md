Output State: **`n` is an input integer from the split operation, `i` is `n`, `p[i]` is `ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`, `ind` is `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `p[i]`, or `ind`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values.
