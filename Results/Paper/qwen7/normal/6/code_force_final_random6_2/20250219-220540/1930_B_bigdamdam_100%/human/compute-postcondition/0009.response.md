Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ind` is `ind - 4`, `p[3]` is `ind - 4`**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decrements the value of `ind` by 2. Since `ind` was initially `ind - 2`, after executing the code, `ind` becomes `ind - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
