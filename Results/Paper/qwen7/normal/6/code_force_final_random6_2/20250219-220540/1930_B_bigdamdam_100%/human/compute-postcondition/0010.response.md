Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ind` is `ind - 4`, and `p[3]` is `ind - 4`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 5.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` becomes 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 5.
   - `ind` and `p[3]` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `ind` is `ind - 4`, `p[3]` is `ind - 4`**
