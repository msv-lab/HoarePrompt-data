Output State: `ind` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[12]` is `8`, and every second index starting from 8 up to `n-2` (inclusive) will have values decrementing by 2 from `n` to 6.

This means that if the loop runs its full course, the list `p` will have values set at indices 8, 12, 14, ..., up to `n-2` (if `n-2` is even), with each value being `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `6` respectively. The variable `ind` will be 6 when the loop finishes, and `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
