Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `ind` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `ind` is incremented by 2, so if initially `ind` was `ind`, then now `ind` is `ind + 2`, which simplifies to 3 since `ind` was the value at `p[1]` and initially was `ind`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
