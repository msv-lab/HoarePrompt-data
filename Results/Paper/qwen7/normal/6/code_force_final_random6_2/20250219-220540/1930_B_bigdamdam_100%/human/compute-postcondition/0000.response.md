Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a non-negative integer.
   - Given the constraints, `t` (which is `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.
   - We also need to initialize `i` to 0 because the `range` function in Python generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the given number.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0**
