Output State: **`bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of the next `pos` in the list, `total_bullets_needed` is `3 * health`**

Explanation: The line `can_survive = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `can_survive`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
