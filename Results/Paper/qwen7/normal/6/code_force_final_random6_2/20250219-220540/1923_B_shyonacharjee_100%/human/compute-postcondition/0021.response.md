Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `pos` is the second element of the next tuple in the list, `health` is the first element of the next tuple in the list, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `bullets_used` is increased by `health` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
