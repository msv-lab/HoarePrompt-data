#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers: a list of length n containing integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and another list of length n containing integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all the tuples in the `monsters` list, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is an empty list, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
    #
    #This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, the `monsters` list gets emptied as each tuple is processed. The `can_survive` variable remains `False` since the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` was met in the first iteration, and no subsequent changes were made to it. The `bullets_used` variable accumulates the sum of the `health` values of all monsters. The variables `n` and `k` remain as they were in the initial input, and `x` and `a` retain their original values from the inputs provided during the first iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), a list of integers \( a \), and a list of integers \( x \). For each test case, it sorts the pairs of integers from the lists \( x \) and \( a \) based on the absolute value of \( x \). It then checks if the total health of the monsters (sum of the \( a \) values) can be defeated with the given number of bullets \( k \) per unit distance. If the total health exceeds the required bullets for any position, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return anything but prints the result for each test case.
