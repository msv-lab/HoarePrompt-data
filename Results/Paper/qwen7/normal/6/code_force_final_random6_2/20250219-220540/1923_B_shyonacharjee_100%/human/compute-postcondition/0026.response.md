Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by the health of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` remains unchanged if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, and `distance` is set to `abs(pos)`**.

This means that the value of `bullets_used` has been updated to include the health of the next monster, and `total_bullets_needed` is now the sum of `bullets_used` and the health of the next monster. The value of `can_survive` remains unchanged unless `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k`. Additionally, `distance` is now set to the absolute value of `pos`.
