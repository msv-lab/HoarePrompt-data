Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by the health of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health of the next monster`, `can_survive` remains unchanged if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, and `distance` is set to `abs(pos)`**.

This means that the `distance` variable is now equal to the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
