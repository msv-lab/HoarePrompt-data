Output State: **`bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`.**

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` increments the value of `bullets_used` by the value of `health`. Initially, `bullets_used` was equal to `health`, so after executing this line, `bullets_used` becomes `2 * health`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
