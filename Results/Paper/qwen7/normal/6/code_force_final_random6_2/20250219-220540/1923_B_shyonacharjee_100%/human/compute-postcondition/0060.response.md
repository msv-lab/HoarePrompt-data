Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by `health`, `health` is the health of the next monster, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
