State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 â‹… 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the specified number.
3. Additionally, `t` is constrained by the problem statement to be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
4. Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `t` satisfies these conditions.

Hence, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(3 \cdot 10^4\).
