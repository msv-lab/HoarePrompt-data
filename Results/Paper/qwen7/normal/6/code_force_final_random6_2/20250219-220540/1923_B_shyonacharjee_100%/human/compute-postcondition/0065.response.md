Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health + bullets_used`, `health` is the health of the next monster, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and `can_survive` is False.**

The code `bullets_used += health` increases the value of `bullets_used` by the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
