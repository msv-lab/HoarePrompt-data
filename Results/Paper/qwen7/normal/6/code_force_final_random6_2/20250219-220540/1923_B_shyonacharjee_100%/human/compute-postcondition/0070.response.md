Output State: **`can_survive` is `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `monsters` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `can_survive`, `bullets_used`, and `monsters` remains unchanged. Therefore, `can_survive` is still `False`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters (which is still the same as before), `n` is now an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `monsters` is still an empty list.
