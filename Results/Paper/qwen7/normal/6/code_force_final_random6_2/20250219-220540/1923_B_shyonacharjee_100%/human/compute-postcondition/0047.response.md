Postcondition: `monsters` is a list of tuples, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.
