Output State: **`bullets_used` is `3 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of the next `pos` in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`.**

Explanation: The initial value of `bullets_used` is `2 * health`. After executing `bullets_used += health`, `bullets_used` is updated to `3 * health`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
