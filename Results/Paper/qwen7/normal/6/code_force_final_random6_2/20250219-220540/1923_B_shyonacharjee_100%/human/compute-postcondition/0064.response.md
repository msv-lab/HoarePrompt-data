Postcondition: `bullets_used` is increased by `health`, `health` is the health of the next monster, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and `can_survive` is False. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
