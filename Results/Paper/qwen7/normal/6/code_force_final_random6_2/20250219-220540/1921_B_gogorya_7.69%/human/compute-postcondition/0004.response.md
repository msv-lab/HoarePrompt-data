Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is a string input by the user, `s2` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
