Output State: **`hd` is an integer greater than 0, now equal to `hd - 1`. All other variables retain their original values.**

This means that the value of `hd` has been decremented by 1, making it an integer greater than -1 (since it was originally greater than 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
