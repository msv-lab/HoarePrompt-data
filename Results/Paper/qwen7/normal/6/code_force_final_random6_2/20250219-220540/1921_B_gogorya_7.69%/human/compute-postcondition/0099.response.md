Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `hd` is `hd - 1`, `s1` and `s2` are strings, and `res` is `res + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1, so `res` becomes `res + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `hd`, `s1`, `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
