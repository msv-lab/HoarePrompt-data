Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is a string input by the user, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1` (`a1`) and `s2` (`a2`), and assigns this value to `res`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
