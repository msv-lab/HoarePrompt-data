Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `hd` is greater than 0; we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the code simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `n`, and `hd` remain unchanged. The precondition that `hd` is greater than 0 also remains valid.
