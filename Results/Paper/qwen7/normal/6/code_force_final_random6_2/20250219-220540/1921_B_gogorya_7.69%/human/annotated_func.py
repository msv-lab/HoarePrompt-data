#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second and third lines are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters representing the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `hd` will be equal to `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` will be the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`, and `t` will remain 0. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n`, `hd` will reflect the difference between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` minus the number of iterations (`n`), `res` will contain the count of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' for all characters from the end of the strings to the beginning, and `t` will still be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of box flips required to transform the initial state represented by \( s1 \) into the desired state represented by \( s2 \). A box flip changes all '0's to '1's and all '1's to '0's within the box. The function outputs the total count of such flips needed for each test case.
