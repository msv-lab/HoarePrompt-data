Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data for multiple test cases.
2. It processes each test case by calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
3. The logic for counting the number of valid triangles is implemented as follows:
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length `i`, the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length `i`, the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks seen so far, which helps in calculating the number of ways to choose sticks of different lengths.
4. The program correctly handles the constraints and the additional input constraints mentioned in the problem statement.
5. The output format matches the expected output, printing the results for each test case on a new line.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
