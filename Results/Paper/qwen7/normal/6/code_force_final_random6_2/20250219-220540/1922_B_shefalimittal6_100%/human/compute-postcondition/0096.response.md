Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, and ans is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. The values of `cnt` and `i` are updated as per their initial conditions, but the exact values of `cnt` and `v[i]` are not specified. The condition that `i` must be less than `n + 1` remains valid.
