Output State: **`cnt` is the sum of all elements in the list `v`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is the sum of two parts as described, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `t` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n`, where `idx` is `4 + n`. The other variables (`cnt`, `ans`, `results`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
