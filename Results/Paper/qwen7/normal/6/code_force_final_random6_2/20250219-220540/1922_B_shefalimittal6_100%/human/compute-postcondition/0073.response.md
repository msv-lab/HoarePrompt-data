Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is equal to the initial value plus `n`; `v[x]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` is derived from `data[idx]` for the respective iteration.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will still be at least 1 (as it was initially), `idx` will be increased by `n` from its initial value, and the list `v` will have its element at index `x` incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, where `x` is determined by the value of `data[idx]` during each iteration.
