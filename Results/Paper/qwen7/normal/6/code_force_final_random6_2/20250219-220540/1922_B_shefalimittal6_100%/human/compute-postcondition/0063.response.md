Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1.**

The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `v` or `x`, we can only say that `v[x]` is increased by 1. The conditions for `n` and `idx` remain unchanged.
