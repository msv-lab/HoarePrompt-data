Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `n` must be non-negative, the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Since `cnt` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged at 0. The other variables (`idx`, `n`, and `v[i]`) remain unaffected by this operation.
