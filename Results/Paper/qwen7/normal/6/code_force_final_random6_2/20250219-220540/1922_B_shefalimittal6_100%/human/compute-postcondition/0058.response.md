Output State: **`cnt` is the sum of all elements in the list `v`, `idx` is equal to `5 + n`, `ans` is the sum of two parts as described, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `t` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `4 + n` to `5 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
