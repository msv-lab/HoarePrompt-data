Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is calculated based on the specified conditions, and `idx` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. Since no other operations are performed on `cnt`, `ans`, or `idx`, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that `results` now contains the string representation of `ans`.
