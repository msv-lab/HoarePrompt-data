Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is 0, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is 0, the list `v` has been updated such that `v[i]` represents how many times the index `i` appeared in the sublist of `data` starting from `data[5]` to `data[4+n]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is `v[idx]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is either `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, or remains unchanged if the current value of `v[i]` is less than 3, `n` must be non-negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is `v[9]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is updated by adding `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if `v[4 + n]` is greater than or equal to 3, and remains unchanged if `v[4 + n]` is less than 3; `n` must be non-negative, `i` is 5, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` which is `v[5]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is `v[9] + v[i]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, and `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[6]`. If `v[6]` is at least 3, `ans` is updated by adding `v[6] * (v[6] - 1) * (v[6] - 2) // 6` to its current value. If `v[6]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
