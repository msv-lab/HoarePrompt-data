Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state, while a new variable `data` is created and assigned the split input. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, and the precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid.
