Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `data`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
