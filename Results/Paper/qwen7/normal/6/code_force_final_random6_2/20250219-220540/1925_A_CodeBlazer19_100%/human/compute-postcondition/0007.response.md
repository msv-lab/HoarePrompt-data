Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (not involved in the loop head).
   - `k` is an input integer (not involved in the loop head).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `t` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 676.
- `i` is now 2.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` remains an input integer.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
