Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 676`, the new state maintains this condition but updates `t` to be the input integer. The variables `n` and `k` are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by the given code snippet.
