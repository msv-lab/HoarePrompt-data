Output State: The value of `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations `t`, `n` will be an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer for each iteration, `k` will be an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer for each iteration.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have the final value of `t`, and for each `i` from 0 to `t-1`, there will be corresponding values of `n` and `k` which were inputs during those iterations.
