Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into two integers, `n` and `k`, using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, but their specific values are not known from the initial state. The conditions on `t` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
