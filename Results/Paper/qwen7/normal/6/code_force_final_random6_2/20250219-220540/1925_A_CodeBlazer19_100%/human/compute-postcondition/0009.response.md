To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

   - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]`: This slice operation takes the substring from the start of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` up to the character at index `k-1` (since Python uses zero-based indexing).
   - `* n`: This repeats the resulting substring `n` times.

Given these points, the output will be the substring `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` truncated to the first `k` characters, repeated `n` times.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where k and n are the respective integer inputs from the user)**
