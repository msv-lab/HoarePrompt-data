Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is set to the original value of `l[2]`, `b` is set to the original value of `a`, and `c` is incremented by 1.
