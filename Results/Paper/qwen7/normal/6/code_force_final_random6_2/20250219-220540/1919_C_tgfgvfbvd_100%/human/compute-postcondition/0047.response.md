Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to `l[0]` or `l[2]` depending on the condition, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 2. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[2]` and `c` is incremented by 1.
