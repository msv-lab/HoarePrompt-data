Output State: **`initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `a` and `b` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `initial_iterations`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, these values remain as they were in the initial state.
