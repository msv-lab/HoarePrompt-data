Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is set to infinity, `b` is set to infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is equal to `n - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to either the original value of `b` or the element at index `x` in list `l`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`. If the element at index `x` in list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `b`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the element at index `x` in list `l`, and `b` remains equal to the original value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then no change occurs to `a` and `b`, and `c` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is set to the original value of `l[2]`, `b` is set to the original value of `a`, and `c` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
