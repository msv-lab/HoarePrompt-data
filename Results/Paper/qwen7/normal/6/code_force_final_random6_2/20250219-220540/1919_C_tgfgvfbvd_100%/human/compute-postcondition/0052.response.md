Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is equal to the number of elements in the list `l`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `a` is equal to the minimum value in the list `l`.
- `b` is equal to the second smallest value in the list `l`.
- `c` is equal to the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.
- `x` is equal to `n - 1`.

The print statement is `print(c)`, which will print the value of `c`.

To determine the value of `c`, we need to know the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than `b`. Since the exact values in the list `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact number. However, we can describe it in terms of the elements of the list.

Output: **c (where c is the number of elements in the list l that are greater than b)**
