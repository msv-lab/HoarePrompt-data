Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to positive infinity, `c` is 0, and `x` is 0. Regardless of the condition in the if statement, `a` is set to `l[0]`, `b` remains positive infinity, `c` is 0, and `x` remains 0.
