Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0, the current value of `x` is 0, `a` is now equal to `b` and `b` is now equal to positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is positive infinity and `b` is positive infinity. After the swap, `a` takes the value of `b` (which is positive infinity) and `b` takes the value of `a` (which is also positive infinity). All other variables remain unchanged.
