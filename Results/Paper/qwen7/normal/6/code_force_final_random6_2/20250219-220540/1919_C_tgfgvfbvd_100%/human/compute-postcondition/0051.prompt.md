Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to positive infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[1]`, `b` is equal to `l[1]`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 1.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `l[x] <= a` is true, then `a` is updated to `l[1]` and `c` remains as it was. If the condition is false, then `c` is updated to include the additional possibility of being 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[2]`, `b` is equal to `l[0]` or `l[2]` depending on the condition, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether `l[0]` or `l[2]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 2. If `l[x]` (which is `l[2]`) is less than or equal to `b` (which is `l[0]`), then `b` remains unchanged and `c` remains as it is. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[2]` and `c` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
