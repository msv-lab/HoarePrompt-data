Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 4` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is equal to either `l[x+1]` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `b` is equal to either `l[x+1]` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, and `c` is 1 if either `l[x+1]` or `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` remains 0. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `c` is set to 1 if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` remains 0. There is no else part in the code.
