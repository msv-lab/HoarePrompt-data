Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is the current value of `b`, `b` is the current value of `a`, and `c` is 0. If the initial value of `a` is greater than the initial value of `b`, then after the if-else block executes, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped, otherwise, they remain unchanged.
