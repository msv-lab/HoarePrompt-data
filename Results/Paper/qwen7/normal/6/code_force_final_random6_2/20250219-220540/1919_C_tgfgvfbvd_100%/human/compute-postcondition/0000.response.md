Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when the value of the loop counter is not needed. It is typically used to indicate that the loop is being used for its side effects or to perform some action for each iteration.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the input is valid and there are test cases to process. The condition for the loop to continue is that there should be more input available.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are `t` test cases.
   - Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that there are still test cases left to process. This means we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. Once a test case is processed, `t` will decrease by 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
