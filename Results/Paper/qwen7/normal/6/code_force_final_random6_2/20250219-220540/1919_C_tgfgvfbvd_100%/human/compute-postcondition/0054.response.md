Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to the minimum value in the list `l`, `b` is equal to the second smallest value in the list `l`, `c` is equal to the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`, `x` is equal to `n - 2`**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
