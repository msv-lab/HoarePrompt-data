Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, `s` will be the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding elements, and the other variables (`a`, `b`, `cp`, `lit`, `x`, `y`, `n`) will retain their values from the final iteration of the loop or their initial states if they were not modified by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(b)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then the condition remains unchanged. If there is no else part, the condition stays as is based on the if part alone.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `len(b)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 2. If `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `s` remains 2. If `b[2]` is not greater than `b[1]`, then no change is made to `s`, and it still remains 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `len(b)` is greater than 3, and `s` is 3. If `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`, then `s` remains 3. If `b[3]` is not greater than `b[2]`, then no change is made to `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
