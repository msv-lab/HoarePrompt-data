Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, after the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` will now be 3).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`cp`, `t`, `lit`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `b`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 3, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**
