Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is appended to list `b` and becomes the last element of list `b`.
