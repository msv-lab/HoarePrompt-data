Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[1]` and `x` equal to the last element of list `a`; `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty); `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `a` becomes a non-empty list with its last element being `lit[1]`. Since `x` is defined as the last element of list `a`, `x` also becomes `lit[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
