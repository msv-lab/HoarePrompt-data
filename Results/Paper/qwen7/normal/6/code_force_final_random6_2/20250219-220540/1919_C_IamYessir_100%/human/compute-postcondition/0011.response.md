Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. Since `a` is not an empty list, `x` now holds the value of the last element in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
