State: **`s` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(a)`.
2. The loop condition `1 <= i < len(a)` must be satisfied for the loop to execute.
3. Initially, `s` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. The variable `i` should be set to 1 because the loop starts from 1 (inclusive).
5. The variable `len(a)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once (since `i` starts at 1).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
