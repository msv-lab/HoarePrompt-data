Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 0, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x > y`, then `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y` holds true for the current value of `x`, or `b` has an additional element which is equal to `lit[0]`. If `x <= y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` has its last element as `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is added to `b` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`.
