Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If `x` is greater than `y`, then `x` remains greater than `y`, and `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]` if `x` is not already the last element of `a`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` is set to `lit[0]` if `x` is the last element of `a`, or `a` is updated to include `lit[0]` as the last element if `x` is not the last element of `a`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` remains less than or equal to `y`, and `a` remains unchanged.
