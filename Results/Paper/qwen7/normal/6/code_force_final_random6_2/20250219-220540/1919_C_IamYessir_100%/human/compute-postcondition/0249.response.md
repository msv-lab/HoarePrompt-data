Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 3, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` contains an additional element which is the i-th element from `lit`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, then `a` remains unchanged and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` is updated to have its last element as `lit[i]` and `b`, `cp`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `lit`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
