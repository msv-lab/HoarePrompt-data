Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` which is `None` since `a` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` attempts to assign the last element of list `a` to `x`. Since `a` is an empty list, `a[-1]` results in `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
