Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a non-empty list with the first element being `lit[0]` and the rest of the elements being the same as before, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is `lit[0]`. This means `a` becomes a non-empty list with its first element as `lit[0]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
