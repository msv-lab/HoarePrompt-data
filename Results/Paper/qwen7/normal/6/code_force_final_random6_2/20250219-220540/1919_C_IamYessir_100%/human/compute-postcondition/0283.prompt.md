Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is the length of `b` or `len(b) + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` is updated to contain the i-th element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged and `b` is updated to contain the i-th element of `lit` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` becomes `['lit[i]']`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 3, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` contains an additional element which is the i-th element from `lit`. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` is updated to have its last element as `lit[i]` and `b`, `cp`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `lit`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` equals `y`, then `a` is updated to contain `lit[i]`. In all other cases, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is either `len(b) + 4` or `len(b) + 5`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `y >= lit[i]`, `b` will contain an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x == y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` remains unchanged. If `x < y` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x < y`, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
