Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list where the last element is `lit[2]`; `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`; and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a.append(lit[2])` adds `lit[2]` to the end of list `a`, making the last element of `a` equal to `lit[2]`. The values of `n`, `b`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
