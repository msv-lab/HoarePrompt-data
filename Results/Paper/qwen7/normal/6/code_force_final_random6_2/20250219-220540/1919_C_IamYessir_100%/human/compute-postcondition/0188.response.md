Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `a[-1]` which is `None` since `a` is an empty list.
