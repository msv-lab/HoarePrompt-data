Output State: `a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `a` and `b` will be determined based on the input list `lit`. The variable `cp` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The variable `s` will be the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, calculated during the loop's execution. The variables `lit`, `x`, and `y` retain their final values as they are updated within the loop based on the conditions provided.
