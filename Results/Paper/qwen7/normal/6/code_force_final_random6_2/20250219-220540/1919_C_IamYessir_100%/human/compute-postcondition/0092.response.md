Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a non-empty list with its last element being `lit[0]`, `i` is 2. If `y >= lit[i]` (i.e., `y >= lit[2]`), then `b` is a list with one more element than before, and the last element of `b` is `lit[2]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list with one more element than before, where the last element is `lit[1]` if `lit[2] > x`, or `y` is set to `lit[2]` if `x >= lit[2]` and `lit[2] > y`.
