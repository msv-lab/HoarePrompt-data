Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the original last element of the list `a`, `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`, and `y` is equal to `b[1]`.**

The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of list `b` to `y`. Since `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`, `y` is now equal to `b[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
