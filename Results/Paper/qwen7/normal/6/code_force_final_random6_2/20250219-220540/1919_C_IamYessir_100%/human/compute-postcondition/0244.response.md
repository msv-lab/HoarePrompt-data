Output State: **`a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 3, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b` appended by the value of `lit[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. The value of `i` is updated to `len(b) + 2` plus 1, making it `len(b) + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
