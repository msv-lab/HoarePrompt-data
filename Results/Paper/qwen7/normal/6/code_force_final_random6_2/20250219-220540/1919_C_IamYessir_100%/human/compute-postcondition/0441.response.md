Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the original last element of the list `a`, `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`, and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[2]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
