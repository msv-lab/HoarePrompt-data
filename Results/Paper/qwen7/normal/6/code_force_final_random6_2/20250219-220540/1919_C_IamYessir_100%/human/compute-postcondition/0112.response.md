Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `x` is updated to be the last element of the list `a`. The other variables retain their initial conditions or constraints.
