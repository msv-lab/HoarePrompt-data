Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Arrays**: The logic used to decide whether to add an element to `a` or `b` is flawed. It does not ensure that the resulting arrays `a` and `b` are optimal in terms of minimizing the penalty. Specifically, the conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` do not guarantee the minimum penalty.

2. **Redundant Checks**: The checks for `x` and `y` being infinity are redundant because they will only be true at the start of the loop when the lists `a` and `b` are empty. This can be simplified.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty calculation part seems to be incorrectly implemented. The variable `s` should be initialized to 0 before the loop and incremented correctly based on the conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the two subsequences
        a, b = [], []
        
        # Iterate through the elements and place them in the appropriate subsequence
        for i in range(n):
            if len(a) == 0 or (len(b) > 0 and b[-1] <= lit[i]):
                b.append(lit[i])
            else:
                a.append(lit[i])
        
        # Calculate the penalty for both subsequences
        def calculate_penalty(subseq):
            penalty = 0
            for i in range(1, len(subseq)):
                if subseq[i] > subseq[i - 1]:
                    penalty += 1
            return penalty
        
        p_a = calculate_penalty(a)
        p_b = calculate_penalty(b)
        
        # Output the total penalty
        print(p_a + p_b)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the elements are placed in the subsequences `a` and `b` in a way that minimizes the penalty. It also correctly calculates the penalty for each subsequence and outputs the total penalty.
