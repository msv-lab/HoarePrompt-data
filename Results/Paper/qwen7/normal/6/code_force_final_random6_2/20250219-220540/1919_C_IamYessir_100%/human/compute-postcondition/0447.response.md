Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the original last element of the list `a`, `b` is a list with three elements where the last element is `a[i]`, and `y` is `a[i]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.
