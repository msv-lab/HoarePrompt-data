Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding elements, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`, and then converts the map object to a list. The list is stored in the variable `lit`. The initial values of `i`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
