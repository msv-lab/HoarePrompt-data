Output State: **`a` is now ['lit[i]'], `b` is empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, it now contains `['lit[i]']`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
