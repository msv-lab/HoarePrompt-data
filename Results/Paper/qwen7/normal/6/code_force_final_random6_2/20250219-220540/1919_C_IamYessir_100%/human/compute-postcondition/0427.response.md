Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is now stored in `x`, `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
