Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`; the length of list `b` is not 0; `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. Since the length of list `b` is not 0, `y` will be the last element of `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and the condition on the length of `b` remain unchanged.
