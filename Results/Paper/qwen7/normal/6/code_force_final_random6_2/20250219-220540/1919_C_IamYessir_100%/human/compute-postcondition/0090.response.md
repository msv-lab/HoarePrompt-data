Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a non-empty list with its last element being `lit[0]`, `i` is 2. If `lit[i]` (which is `lit[2]`) is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, which is `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is set to `lit[i]`.
