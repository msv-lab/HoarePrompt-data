Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`) or infinity, `b` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` can be any list, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not).
