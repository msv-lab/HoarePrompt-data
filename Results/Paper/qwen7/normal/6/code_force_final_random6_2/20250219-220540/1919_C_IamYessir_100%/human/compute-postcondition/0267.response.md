Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 5`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`, `b` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. The value of `i` is `len(b) + 4`, so `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The length of `b` increases by 1, and the new value of `b` includes the original elements plus `lit[i]`.
