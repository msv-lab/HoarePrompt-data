Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list containing the element from `lit[1]` appended to the original list, `x` is either infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty).**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 1) from the list `lit` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, the first element of `lit` is appended to `a`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
