Postcondition: `a` is now possibly containing the element `lit[i]`, `b` remains empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.

This postcondition describes that if the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is true, then `lit[i]` is added to list `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. If the condition is false, then `b` remains empty, and other variables retain their original states.
