Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
