Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding elements, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `lit`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
