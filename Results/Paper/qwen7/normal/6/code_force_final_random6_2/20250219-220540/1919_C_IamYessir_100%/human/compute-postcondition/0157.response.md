Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be less than `len(a)`, and `s` is 2 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`; otherwise, `s` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Initially, `s` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`, and 0 otherwise. After executing `s += 1`, `s` will be 2 if `a[2]` was initially 1, and 1 if `a[2]` was initially 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
