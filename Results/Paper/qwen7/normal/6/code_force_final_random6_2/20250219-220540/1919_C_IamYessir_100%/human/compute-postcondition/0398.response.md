Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
