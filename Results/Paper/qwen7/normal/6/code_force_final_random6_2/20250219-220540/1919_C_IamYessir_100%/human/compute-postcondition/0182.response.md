Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `len(b)` must be less than `n`. The length of list `a` is currently 0.
