Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 4`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The line `x = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `x`. Since `x` was previously defined as `x` being a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, this assignment overrides the previous value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
