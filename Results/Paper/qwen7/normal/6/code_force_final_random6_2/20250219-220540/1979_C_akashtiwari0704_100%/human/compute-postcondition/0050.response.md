Output State: **`i` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t` remains 0, `g` is `l[1] * l[2] // gcd(l[1], l[2])`, `prod` remains unchanged, `sumo` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, which means `g` is now `l[1] * l[2] // gcd(l[1], l[2])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
