Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `sumo` is 0, `a[i]` is `lcm(a) // 20`, `i` is 8, `ans` is "11 11 11 11 11", `T` is 9, `t` must be greater than or equal to 9, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple of the elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `sumo` to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
