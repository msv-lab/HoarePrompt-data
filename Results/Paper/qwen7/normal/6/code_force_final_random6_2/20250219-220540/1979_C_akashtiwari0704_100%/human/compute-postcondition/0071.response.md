Output State: `sumo` is 33, `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, `i` is 5, `bets` is 5.

Explanation: Given that the loop runs `bets` times, and after 3 iterations `sumo` is 22 with `a[i]` being `prod // 20`, we can infer that each iteration adds `a[i]` to `sumo`. Since `bets` is 5, after all 5 iterations, `sumo` will be `22 + (5 - 3) * (prod // 20) = 22 + 2 * (prod // 20)`. If `prod // 20` is 11 (as implied by the previous state), then `sumo` becomes 33. Also, since the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets`, which is 5. The other variables (`sumo`, `bets`, `a[i]`, `i`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
