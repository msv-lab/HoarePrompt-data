Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `i` is the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial values of `bets`, `t`, `g`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `a` now holds the newly created list of integers.
