Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 8.
   - `bets` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially 8, for the loop to execute, `bets` must be greater than 8 (because `i` starts at 8 and the loop will run until `i` is less than `bets`).
   - `i` will start at 8 and increment by 1 in each iteration, so it will be 8, 9, 10, etc., depending on the value of `bets`.

5. **Final state required for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` should start at 8.
   - `bets` must be greater than 8 to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 8, `bets` must be greater than 8**
