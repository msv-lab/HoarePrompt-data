Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is 33.
- `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, but the value of `prod` is not explicitly given.
- `i` is 5.
- `bets` is 5.
- The condition `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` holds true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
