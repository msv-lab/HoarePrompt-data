Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `bets + 10`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 8 to `bets-1`, and the value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 8 to `bets-1`. Additionally, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` contains the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index 8 to `bets-1`, each followed by a space.**
