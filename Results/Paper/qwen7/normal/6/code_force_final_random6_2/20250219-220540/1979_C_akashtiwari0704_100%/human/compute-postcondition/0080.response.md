Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the current value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `bets` must be the same.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i + 1 < bets`, which means `i` must be less than `bets` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans`: The value of `ans` remains the same because it is not directly modified within the loop head.
   - `i`: It will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `bets`: It remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is the current value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is incremented by 1, `bets` must be the same**
