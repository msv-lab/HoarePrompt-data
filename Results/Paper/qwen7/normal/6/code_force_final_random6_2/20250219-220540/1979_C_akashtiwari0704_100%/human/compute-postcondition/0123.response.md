Output State: **`i` is `bets + 1`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10, `ans` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i-1]` followed by a space, `ans` also includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Given that `i` is `bets + 1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10. The variable `ans` is updated to include both `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` with spaces between them.
