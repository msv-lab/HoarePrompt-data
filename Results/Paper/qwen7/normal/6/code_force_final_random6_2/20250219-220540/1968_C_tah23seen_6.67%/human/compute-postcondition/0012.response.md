Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:

- `arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).
- `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is 0, except for `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`. For all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i]`. Specifically, `ans[i + 1] = ans[i] + ans[i - 1] + ... + ans[0]`.

This means that after the loop completes, `ans` will contain the cumulative sums of all previous elements in `ans`, starting from `ans[0]` which is initialized as `arr[0] + 1`. Each subsequent element in `ans` is the sum of all preceding elements including itself, ensuring that the sequence grows exponentially based on the initial condition and the loop's accumulation logic.
