Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 0, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the value of `n` also remains unchanged.
