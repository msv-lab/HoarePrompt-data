Output State: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0, `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `ans[0]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. Initially, `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `ans[1]` is updated to be equal to `ans[0]`, which is `arr[0] + 1`. All other elements of `ans` remain 0, and the rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
