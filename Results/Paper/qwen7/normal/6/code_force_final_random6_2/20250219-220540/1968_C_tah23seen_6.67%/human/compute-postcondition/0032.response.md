Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i + 1]` plus `ans[i]`. This means `ans[i + 1]` has been updated.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop condition depends on `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`, we need to ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is still less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Consider the Update**: After the update, `ans[i + 1]` is now `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Given this, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ans[i + 1]` such that it remains within the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1]' plus `ans[i]' and must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]'**
