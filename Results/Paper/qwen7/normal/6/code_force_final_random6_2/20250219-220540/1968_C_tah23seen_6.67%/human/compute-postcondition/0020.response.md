Output State: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \); `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[4] = arr[3] + ans[3]` and `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[3]`; `ans[4]` is updated to `ans[3] + ans[3]` which is `2 * ans[3]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the element `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Specifically, for `i = 3`, it updates `ans[4]` to `ans[3] + ans[3]`, which simplifies to `2 * ans[3]`. All other elements of `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[3]` remains valid, and the value of `arr` remains unchanged.
