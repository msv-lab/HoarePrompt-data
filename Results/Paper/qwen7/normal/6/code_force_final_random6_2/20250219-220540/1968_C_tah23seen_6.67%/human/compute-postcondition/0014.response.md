Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[i]` (for \( 0 \leq i < n \)) is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`, with the loop continuing until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**
