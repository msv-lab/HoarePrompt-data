Output State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1]' plus `ans[i]'**.

In the given code snippet, `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments the value of `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. The condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` still holds, but since no specific values for `ans[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are provided, we only know that `ans[i + 1]` has been updated accordingly.
