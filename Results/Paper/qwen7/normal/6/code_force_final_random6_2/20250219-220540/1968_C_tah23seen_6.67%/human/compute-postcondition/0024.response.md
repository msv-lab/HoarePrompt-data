Output State: `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` values up to `ans[i]`.

To understand this, let's break down the process:

1. Initially, `ans[1]` is set to `arr[0]`.
2. The loop starts with `i = 1` (since `ans[i+1]` is used).
3. In each iteration, the loop checks if `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. If it is, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
4. This process continues until `ans[i + 1]` becomes greater than `arr[i + 1]` for some `i`.

After all iterations, `ans[i + 1]` will be the cumulative sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` values up to `ans[i]`. This means that `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of `arr[i]` plus all the accumulated values from previous steps.
