Output State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1]' plus `ans[i]', and the condition that `ans[i + 1]' must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]' still holds.**

This means that the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to its original value plus the value of `ans[i]`. The condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` remains unchanged and is still valid.
