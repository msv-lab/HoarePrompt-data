Output State: `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all previous `ans[j]` values from `j = 1` to `i`. Specifically, `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of the first `i` elements of the `ans` list.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect:

1. Initially, `ans[1]` is set to some value (let's call it `a1`).
2. The loop starts with `i = 1` and checks if `ans[2]` (which is initially `a1 + a1`) is less than or equal to `arr[1] + a1`. If true, `ans[2]` is updated to `arr[1] + a1`.
3. Next, `i` is incremented to 2, and the loop checks if `ans[3]` (which is now `arr[1] + a1 + arr[1] + a1`) is less than or equal to `arr[2] + (arr[1] + a1)`. If true, `ans[3]` is updated to `arr[2] + (arr[1] + a1)`.
4. This process continues until the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i] + ans[i]` is no longer satisfied for any `i`.

By the end of the loop, `ans[i + 1]` for each `i` will be the cumulative sum of all previous `ans[j]` values up to `j = i`. This means that `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of the first `i` elements of the `ans` list.
