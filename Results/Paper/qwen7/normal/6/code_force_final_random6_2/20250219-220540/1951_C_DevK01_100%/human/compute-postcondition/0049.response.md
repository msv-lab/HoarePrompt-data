Output State: **`n` is the length of `N`, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from input, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Since `m`, `sum(N)`, `n`, and other variables remain unchanged except for the addition of `cost`, the output state includes the new variable `cost` with its calculated value. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
