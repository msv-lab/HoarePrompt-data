Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `N`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`. `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
