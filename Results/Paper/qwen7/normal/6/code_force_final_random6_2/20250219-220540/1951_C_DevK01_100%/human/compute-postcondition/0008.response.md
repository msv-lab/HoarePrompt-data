Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.**

Explanation: The code `N = M[:q]` creates a new list `N` that contains the first `q` elements of the list `M`. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `m`, `k`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
