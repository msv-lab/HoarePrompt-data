Output State: **`n` is one less than the length of `N`, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from input, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, and `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N`. This operation changes the length of `N` by reducing it by one. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
