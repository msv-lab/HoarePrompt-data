Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `w` now holds the value of the last element in `N`, and `N` loses its last element.
