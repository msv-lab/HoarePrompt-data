Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `L`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `L[0]` elements of `M`.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to `L`. The length of `L` is now the number of integers input by the user. The first element of `L` (i.e., `L[0]`) is the length of `L`, the second element (`L[1]`) is the minimum value among the input integers, and the third element (`L[2]`) is the third integer input. The initial conditions for `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
