Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `L[0]` is assigned to `n`, `L[1]` is assigned to `m`, `L[2]` is assigned to `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `n` remain as per the initial state's description, except that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now explicitly assigned the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively.
