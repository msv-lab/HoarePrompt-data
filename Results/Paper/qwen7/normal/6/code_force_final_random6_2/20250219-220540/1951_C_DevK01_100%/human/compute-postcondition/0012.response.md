Output State: **`cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L` (`m`) is the minimum of these two elements, the third element of `L` (`k`) is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, and `n * m` equals `k`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This value is stored in the variable `cost`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
