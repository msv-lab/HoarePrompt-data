Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `M` is updated to a list of integers from the input**.

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string using `map(int, ...)` and then converts them into a list using `list(...)`. This updates the list `M` with the new values from the input. All other variables (`t`, `L`, `N`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `n`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values as per the initial state, except that now `M` is updated to reflect the new input.
