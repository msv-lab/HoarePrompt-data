Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers t, n, m, k, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list a, calculates a cost based on the sorted list and given parameters, and prints the cost. The function ensures that the cost calculation respects the constraints on n, m, and k. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total cost for the last test case.**
