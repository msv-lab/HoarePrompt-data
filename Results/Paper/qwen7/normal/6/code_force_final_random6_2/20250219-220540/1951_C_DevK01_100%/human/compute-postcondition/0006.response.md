Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the sorted list `M` is the updated state, while the other variables retain their initial conditions relative to the list `L`.
