You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs left to process. The state of `L` will be a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the final list `N`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L` from the last iteration. `M` will be a sorted list of integers converted from the last input string. `N` will be a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`. The variable `m` will be the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, and `k` will be `L[2]` from the last iteration. The loop will have completed all its iterations, and the `continue` statement will not be executed since the condition `t > 0` will be false when `t` becomes 0.

    #The `cost` calculation will depend on the specific values of `N`, `m`, and `k` from the last iteration, but it will be printed for the last iteration before the loop terminates.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M`. This is a reasonable step because buying tickets from cheaper days can minimize costs.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The program calculates the minimum cost using the following logic:
     - It determines how many days (`q`) are needed to buy `k` tickets by dividing `k` by `m` and rounding up.
     - It initializes a new list `N` with the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
     - It checks if the total number of tickets that can be bought in these `q` days equals `k`. If so, it calculates the cost directly.
     - If not, it adjusts the cost calculation by considering the remaining tickets and the increased prices due to previous purchases.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the prices ensures that we can buy tickets from the cheapest days first, which is a good strategy to minimize costs.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets that can be bought in the first `q` days equals `k`.
   - When the number of tickets exceeds what can be bought in the first `q` days, it correctly adjusts the cost by considering the increased prices for the remaining days.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `k` is less than or equal to `m` and when `k` is greater than `m`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `4 2 3`, `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Output: `10`
   - Explanation: Buying 1 ticket on day 3 (cost 4) and 2 tickets on day 4 (cost 6).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4 2 8`, `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Output: `64`
   - Explanation: Buying 2 tickets each day for 4 days (each day cost 16).

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `5 100 1`
   - Input: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Buying 1 ticket on day 2 (cost 1).

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `6 3 9`, `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - Output: `72`
   - Explanation: Buying 3 tickets each day for 3 days (each day cost 15).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets under the given constraints.
