Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from input, `N` is a list containing the first `L[0]` elements of `M`, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, and `k` is `L[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and the definitions of `L`, `M`, `N`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are still valid.
