Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
- Expected output: `10` (as explained in the problem statement).

However, the program's logic does not correctly simulate the price increase mechanism. It sorts the list of prices and then tries to distribute the tickets across the days without accurately reflecting the price changes due to previous purchases. This leads to incorrect calculations of the minimum spending required to purchase the tickets.

To illustrate, let's walk through the provided example step-by-step:

1. **Initial Prices**: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
2. **First Day**: No tickets are purchased, so the prices remain `[8, 6, 4, 2]`.
3. **Second Day**: No tickets are purchased, so the prices remain `[8, 6, 4, 2]`.
4. **Third Day**: Purchase 1 ticket, so the price for the next day increases by 1 (from 2 to 3). The updated prices are `[8, 6, 4, 3]`.
5. **Fourth Day**: Purchase 2 tickets, so the price for the next day increases by 2 (from 3 to 5). The updated prices are `[8, 6, 5]`.

The correct minimum cost would be:
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at 4.
- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at 3 and 5, which totals to 8.

Thus, the correct minimum cost is `4 + 3 + 5 = 12`, but the program incorrectly calculates this as `10`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
