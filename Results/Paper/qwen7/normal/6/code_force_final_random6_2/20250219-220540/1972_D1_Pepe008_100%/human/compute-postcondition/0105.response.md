Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m, with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of n and m.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing two integers n and m. The function processes these integers according to the given constraints and returns a specific output for each test case.
