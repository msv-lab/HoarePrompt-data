Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `suma` is increased by `x`, and `x` is equal to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is calculated as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\). The conditions and values of `b` and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
