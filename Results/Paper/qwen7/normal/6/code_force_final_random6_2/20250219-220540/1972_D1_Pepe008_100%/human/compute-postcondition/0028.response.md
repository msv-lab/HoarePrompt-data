Output State: **`b` must be at least 0, `suma` is increased by 1, and `x` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)**

Explanation: The code `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. The values of `b` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `b` must still be at least 0, `suma` is increased by 1, and `x` is still equal to the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.
