Output State: **`suma` is increased by `x`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the value of `x ** 2 + 1` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the current value of `x`. The values of `b`, `x`, and the condition `x ** 2 + 1 > 0` remain unchanged from the initial state.
