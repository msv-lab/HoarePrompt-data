Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is 0, and `suma` is 1. This is because the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is evaluated to be true, and when this happens, `suma` is set to 1. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the condition's evaluation.
