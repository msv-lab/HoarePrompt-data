Output State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `x` is (a - 25) // 25 + 1**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 5, so `i * (i - 1)` becomes `5 * 4`, which is 20. The expression `(a - 20) // 25 + 1` is assigned to `x`. Since the value of `a` is not specified, it remains as `a - 20` divided by 25, rounded down, plus 1. The states of the other variables (`b` and `i`) are not affected by this operation.
