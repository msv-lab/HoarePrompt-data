Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `b + 1`. This means `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `b`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `x` is equal to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).
   - `suma` is increased by 1.
   - If \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), then `b` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `b`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `b`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will be `b + 1`.
   - The value of `b` will remain the same if the condition \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is true. Otherwise, `b` will decrease by `1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `b + 1`.
   - `b` will either remain `b` or decrease by `1` depending on the condition.

Given the conditions, let's assume the condition is not met (since no specific value for `b` is given, we consider the general case where `b` could change). Therefore, `b` will be `b - 1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`b` must be at least 0, `x` is equal to \((a - (b + 1) \times b) // (b + 1)\), and `suma` is increased by 1**.
