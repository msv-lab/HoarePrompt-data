Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current segment of the array being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (0 <= bit < 30). The value of bit is not -1; new_arr is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `new_arr`. The values of `cur_arr` and `bit` remain unchanged from their initial state.
