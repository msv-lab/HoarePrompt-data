Postcondition: **All elements in `new_arr` are unique values of `xor` computed for each segment of `cur_arr` as `xor` is reset to 0 after each append operation, `cur_arr` is empty, and `thing1` is the maximum value from `new_arr` with index `bit - 1` if the condition `xor >> bit & 1` is true. Otherwise, `thing1` remains -1.**
