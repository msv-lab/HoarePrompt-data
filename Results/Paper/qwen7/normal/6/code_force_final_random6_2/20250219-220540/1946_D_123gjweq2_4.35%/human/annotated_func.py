#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 â‰¤ bit < 30) as inputs. It processes the list by computing bitwise XOR values for segments of `cur_arr` and constructs a new list `new_arr`. Depending on the conditions checked, it either returns 0, the maximum value between the maximum value from `new_arr` with index `bit - 1` and the length of `new_arr`, or -1.
