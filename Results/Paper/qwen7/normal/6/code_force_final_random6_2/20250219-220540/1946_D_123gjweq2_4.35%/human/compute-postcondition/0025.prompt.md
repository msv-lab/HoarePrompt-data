Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: xor is 0, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current segment of the array being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (0 <= bit < 30), and thing1 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur_arr` contains at least one element; `xor` is 0; `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`. If the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` is true, then `new_arr` is added to `cur_arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it, and `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one. If `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is 0, then `xor` becomes 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`; `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` appended to it; `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1. If `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is not true (i.e., the bit is 0), then `xor` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
