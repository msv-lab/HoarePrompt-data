You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number `k` such that we can partition the array into `k` segments `[l_i, r_i]` where:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i \le r_i` for all `i`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The problem involves bitwise operations (XOR and OR).
   - The solution seems to use a recursive approach to break down the array based on the current bit position.
   - The function `find_max` is designed to handle this recursive breakdown.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `find_max` with the initial bit position set to 31 (the highest bit position for a 32-bit integer).
   - This is a reasonable starting point since we want to check the highest bit first.

4. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function takes the current array `cur_arr` and the current bit position `bit`.
   - If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of the current array, indicating the base case.
   - It initializes `xor` and `new_arr` to keep track of the cumulative XOR and the new array formed.
   - It iterates through the current array, updating `xor` and appending to `new_arr` when `xor` is zero at the current bit position.
   - If `xor` is non-zero at the current bit position, it sets `thing1` to -1 or recursively finds the maximum segments for the new array.
   - It then checks if the current bit of `x` is set. If it is, it returns the maximum of the recursive call without considering the current bit and the length of `new_arr`. Otherwise, it returns `thing1`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The base case (`bit == -1`) correctly returns the length of the array, which is the maximum number of segments if no further bit constraints apply.

2. **Recursive Breakdown**:
   - The function correctly breaks down the array based on the current bit position.
   - It ensures that the segments are formed such that the bitwise OR of their XORs is considered.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - The use of bitwise operations (XOR and OR) is correctly implemented and used to form the segments and check the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `xor` is non-zero at the current bit position by setting `thing1` appropriately.
   - It correctly handles the case where `x` has a set bit at the current position.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
