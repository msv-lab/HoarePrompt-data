Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the third last element minus 2, `cnt` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1)**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `ans` the value of the last element of `ans` minus 1. Given that the last element of `ans` was originally the second last element minus 1, after appending, the new last element will be the third last element minus 2. The variable `cnt` is decreased by 1 but remains greater than 0.
