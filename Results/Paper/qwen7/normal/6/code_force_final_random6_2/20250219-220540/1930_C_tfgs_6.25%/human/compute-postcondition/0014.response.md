Output State: **`cnt` is `n - len(a)`, the value of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) is now sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new sorted list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, the sorted list `a`, the `counter` object, or the value of `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
