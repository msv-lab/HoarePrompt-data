Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `adv` is min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]]), `ans` is a list containing `a[1]` or `a[2]`, `counter[a[2]]` or `counter[a[3]]` is -1**.

Explanation: The variable `adv` is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `counter[a[2]]` or `counter[a[3]]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
