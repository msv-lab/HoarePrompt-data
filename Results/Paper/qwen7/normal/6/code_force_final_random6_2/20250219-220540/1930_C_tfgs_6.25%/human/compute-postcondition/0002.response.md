Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it starts from 0 at the beginning of the loop.
   - `n` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we don't need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is within the valid range, i.e., \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)**
