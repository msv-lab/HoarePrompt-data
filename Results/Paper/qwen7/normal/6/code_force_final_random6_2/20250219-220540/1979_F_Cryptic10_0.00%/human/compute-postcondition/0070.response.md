Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The variable `d` is being initialized and updated within this loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `d`**: From the given state, `d` is initially `-1`.

3. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. This means `d` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`.

4. **Check the initial condition for the loop to start**: For the loop to start, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This ensures there are valid values for `d` to iterate through.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that `d` starts at `-1`, we need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `n` such that `n - 1` is at least `0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
