Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `remaining_vertices`. The loop will continue as long as `remaining_vertices` is non-empty.

2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `path` is an empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty. Since `remaining_vertices` is initially a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\), it is guaranteed to be non-empty as long as \(n > 0\). Given the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(n\) is always positive and thus `remaining_vertices` is always non-empty.

4. **Conclusion**: No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time because `remaining_vertices` is guaranteed to be non-empty based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\)**.
