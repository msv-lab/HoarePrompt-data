Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of the variables `d`, `n`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify their values.
