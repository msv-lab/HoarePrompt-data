Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
while remaining_vertices:
    for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        v, u = func_1(d)
        if v == 0:
            continue
        if v in remaining_vertices:
            path.append(v)
            remaining_vertices.remove(v)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is the value returned by `func_1(0)` (since the loop runs from `n-1` to `0`), `u` is the value returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v` (where `v` is the last value returned by `func_1(0)`), `remaining_vertices` is an empty set (since all integers from 1 to `n` were removed from `remaining_vertices` during the loop iterations), and `d` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains all the vertices added during the loop iterations, and `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, and `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
