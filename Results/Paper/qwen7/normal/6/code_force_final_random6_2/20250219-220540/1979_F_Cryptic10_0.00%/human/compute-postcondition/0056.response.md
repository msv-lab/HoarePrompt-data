Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the value `v` appended to it and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variable `d` remains `-1`, `n` retains its original value, `v` is no longer part of the set `remaining_vertices`, and `v` is appended to the list `path`. Additionally, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
