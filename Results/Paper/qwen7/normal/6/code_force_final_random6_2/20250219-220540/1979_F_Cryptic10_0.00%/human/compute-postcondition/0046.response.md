Output State: **`d` is 0, `v` is updated to the current value of `v` and appended to `path`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the loop or if statement that was being executed has been broken out of, but the values of the variables `d`, `v`, `path`, `u`, and `remaining_vertices` remain as described in the initial state, except that the action of appending `v` to `path` and removing `v` from `remaining_vertices` has occurred.
