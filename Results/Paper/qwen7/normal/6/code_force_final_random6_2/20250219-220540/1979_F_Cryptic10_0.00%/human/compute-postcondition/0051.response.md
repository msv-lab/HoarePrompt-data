Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values or create new conditions outside of a loop context. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
