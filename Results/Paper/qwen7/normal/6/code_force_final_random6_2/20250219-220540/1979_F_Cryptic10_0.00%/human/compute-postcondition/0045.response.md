Output State: **`d` is 0, `v` is updated to the current value of `v` and appended to `path`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation: The code removes `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `d` remains 0, `v` is still updated to its current value and appended to `path`, `u` remains the second return value of `func_1(0)`, and `v` is no longer part of the set `remaining_vertices`.
