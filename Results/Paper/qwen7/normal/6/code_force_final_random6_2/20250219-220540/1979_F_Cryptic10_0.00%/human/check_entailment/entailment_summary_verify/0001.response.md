### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program and their correctness. However, let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure that every aspect of the program is thoroughly validated against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly prints a query to the standard output and reads the response, returning the values `v` and `u`.
   - It adheres to the problem statement's requirement for sending queries and handling responses.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - Iterates through possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to 0, calling `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and the non-adjacent vertex `u`.
   - If `v` is 0, it skips to the next iteration, indicating that no vertex with the current degree `d` exists.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Ensures that the path is constructed correctly by progressively removing vertices and their edges, maintaining the connectivity necessary for a Hamiltonian path.

3. **Verification Against Problem Description**:
   - The query mechanism in `func_1` is correctly implemented.
   - The path construction logic in `func_2` is sound and ensures that a Hamiltonian path is found within the allowed number of queries.
   - The termination condition is correctly handled, ensuring that all vertices are added to the path.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with the current degree `d` exists by continuing to the next iteration.
   - The removal of vertices and edges is done correctly, ensuring that the graph remains connected and a Hamiltonian path can be found.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries. The approach ensures that the path is built correctly and efficiently within the constraints.
