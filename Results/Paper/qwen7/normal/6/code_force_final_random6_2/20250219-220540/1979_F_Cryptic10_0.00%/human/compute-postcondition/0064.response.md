Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`.**

Explanation: The code removes the variable `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The values of `d`, `n`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial states.
