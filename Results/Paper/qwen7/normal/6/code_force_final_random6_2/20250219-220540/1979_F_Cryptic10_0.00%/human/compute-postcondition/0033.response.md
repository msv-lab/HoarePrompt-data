Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(0)` (since the loop runs from `n-1` to `0`), `u` is the value returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v` (where `v` is the last value returned by `func_1(0)`), `remaining_vertices` is an empty set (since all integers from 1 to `n` were removed from `remaining_vertices` during the loop iterations), and `d` is 0.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, starting from `d = n-1` down to `d = 0`. The variable `v` takes the value returned by `func_1(0)` on the last iteration, and since all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed and added to `path` or removed from `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` is now empty.
