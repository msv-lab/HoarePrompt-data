Output State: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set since all integers from 1 to `n` were removed from it during the loop iterations.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, with `d` decrementing from `n-1` to `-1`. The variable `v` holds the last valid vertex returned by `func_1(d)` that was added to the `path` list before `remaining_vertices` became empty. The `path` list contains all the vertices that met the specified conditions throughout the loop's execution.
