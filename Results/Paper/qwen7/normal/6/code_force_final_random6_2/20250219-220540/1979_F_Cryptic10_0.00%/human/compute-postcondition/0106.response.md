Output State: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set since all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed and added to `path`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning it has iterated through all possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to `-1`. The variable `d` will have reached `-1`, indicating the end of the loop. The variable `v` will hold the last value returned by `func_1(-1)`, and `u` will hold the corresponding second return value. The `path` list will contain all the vertices that met the condition of being in `remaining_vertices` and were successfully appended to `path` before being removed from `remaining_vertices`. Finally, `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set because all vertices from 1 to `n` have been processed.
