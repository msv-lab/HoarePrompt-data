Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `d` and `n`. The loop iterates over `d` in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is 0 (since it was the last value in the previous iteration).
   - `v` is updated to the current value of `v` and appended to `path`.
   - `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`.
   - `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `d` is within the range specified by `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. Since `d` starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will stop when `d` becomes less than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `d` is currently 0, the next value of `d` would be `-1` if the loop were to continue.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `v` is updated and appended to `path` in each iteration, but its value is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `u` is determined by `func_1(0)` and does not change within the loop.
   - `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` in each iteration, but since it is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, it doesn't affect the loop continuation.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `d` needs to be adjusted to `-1` for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `v` and `u` are not directly relevant to the loop condition, so they remain as they are.
   - `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged as `v` is no longer in it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is updated to the current value of `v` and appended to `path`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`, and `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.**
