The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, meaning all integers from 1 to `n` were removed from it during the loop iterations. For the loop to be executed one more time, there must still be some vertices remaining in `remaining_vertices`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(0)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v` (where `v` is the last value returned by `func_1(0)`), `remaining_vertices` is not empty, and `d` is 0**.
