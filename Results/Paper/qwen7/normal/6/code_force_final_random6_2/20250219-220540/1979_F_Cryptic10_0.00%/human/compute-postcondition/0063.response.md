Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `path` contains `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)` and `d` is -1, `v` retains its value from `func_1(-1)`. The other variables (`n`, `u`) remain unchanged.
