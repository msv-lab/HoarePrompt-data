Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code initializes `remaining_vertices` as a set containing all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). This means that `remaining_vertices` is now a set with elements starting from 1 up to n. The values of `n` and `path` remain unchanged from their initial state.
