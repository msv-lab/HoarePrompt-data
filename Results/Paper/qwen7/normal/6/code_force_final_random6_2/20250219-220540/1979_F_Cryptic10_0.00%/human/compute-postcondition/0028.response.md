Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and `d` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `n-2`, `v` remains unchanged. The value of `u` also remains unchanged as it was previously the value returned by `func_1(d)`. The set `remaining_vertices` and the integer `d` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the only change is that `v` is added to the end of the list `path`.
