Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `v` is the value returned by `func_1(0)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(0)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v` (where `v` is the last value returned by `func_1(0)`), `remaining_vertices` is not empty, and `d` is 0
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is 0, `v` is updated to the current value of `v` and appended to `path`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`, and `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the value `v` appended to it and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
