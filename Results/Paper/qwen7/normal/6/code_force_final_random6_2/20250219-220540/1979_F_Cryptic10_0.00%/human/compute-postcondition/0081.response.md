Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `v` was being checked and removed from `remaining_vertices`. The value of `d` remains unchanged as `-1`, and the value of `u` is not affected since no assignment to `u` is made in the given code snippet.
