To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `res` is defined based on the values of `k` and `n`:
     - If `k == n`, then `res` is a list with `n` elements, each being `1`.
     - If `k == 1`, then `res` is a range object from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).
     - Otherwise, `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.
   - `t` is an integer between `1` and \(10^3\) (inclusive), but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(*res)` uses the `*` operator to unpack the list or range object `res` into separate arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Possible Values of `res`:**
   - Since `n` and `k` are not specified, we need to consider the three possible cases for `res`:
     - Case 1: If `k == n`, `res` is `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (with `n` ones).
     - Case 2: If `k == 1`, `res` is `range(0, n)` which is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
     - Case 3: If neither `k == n` nor `k == 1`, `res` is `[-1]`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Given the unpacking operation `*res` in the print statement, the output will be the elements of `res` separated by spaces.
   - For the unpacked list or range, the elements will be printed directly.

Based on the above analysis, the output will depend on the value of `k` relative to `n`:

- If `k == n`, the output will be a series of `1`s separated by spaces.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1` separated by spaces.
- If neither `k == n` nor `k == 1`, the output will be `-1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **[1, 1, ..., 1] (if k == n), [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1] (if k == 1), or [-1] (otherwise)**
