You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, as it starts from a value between 1 and \(10^3\) and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. For each iteration, `n` and `k` will be input integers that determine the value of `res`. The value of `res` will depend on the conditions: if `k == n`, then `res` will be `[1] * n`; if `k == 1`, then `res` will be `range(n)`; otherwise, `res` will be `[-1]`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, and `res` will be determined by the last values of `n` and `k` entered by the user, following the specified conditions.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It then constructs the result list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`:
     - If \(k == n\), it creates an array with all elements equal to `1`.
     - If \(k == 1\), it creates an array where the elements are a range from `0` to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating that no valid array can be constructed.

3. **Checking the Validity of the Solution:**
   - **Case \(k == n\):**
     - An array with all elements equal to `1` will have all cyclic shifts sorted.
     - This is correct because every cyclic shift of `[1, 1, ..., 1]` is `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, which is sorted.
   - **Case \(k == 1\):**
     - An array with elements `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one cyclic shift sorted.
     - Specifically, the shift starting at index `n-1` will be sorted: `[n-1, 0, 1, ..., n-2]`.
     - All other shifts will not be sorted.
   - **Case \(k != n\) and \(k != 1\):**
     - Setting `res` to `[-1]` is correct because no array can satisfy the condition of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(k\) is neither \(1\) nor \(n\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution correctly handles all specified cases and ensures that the output is either a valid array or `-1` as required.
