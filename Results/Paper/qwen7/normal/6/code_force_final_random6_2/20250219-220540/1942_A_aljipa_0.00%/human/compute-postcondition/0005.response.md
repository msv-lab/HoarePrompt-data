Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `t` and the loop counter, which is represented by `_`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`.
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is represented by an underscore, it is incremented automatically within the loop.
   - The variable `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration because `range(t)` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t`. The other variables (`res`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
