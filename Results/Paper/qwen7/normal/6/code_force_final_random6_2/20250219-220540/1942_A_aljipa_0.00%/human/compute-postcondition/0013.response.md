Output State: `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive) minus (number of iterations remaining), `n` and `k` are input integers for each iteration.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will be `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` will be `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` will be `[-1]`. The value of `t` will be reduced to 0 since it started as an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers that define the state of `res` for that particular iteration.
