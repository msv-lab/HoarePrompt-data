Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k == n`, then `res = [1] * n` (a list with `n` elements, each being 1).
     - If `k == 1`, then `res = range(n)` (a range object from 0 to `n-1`).
     - Otherwise (`k != n` and `k != 1`), `res = [-1]` (a list with a single element -1).

2. **Values of `t`, `n`, and `k`:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 2, so `t` is an integer between -1 and 998.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided. We need to consider the different cases for `res` based on the value of `k`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*res)`, which will print the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

Given the conditions for `res`:
- If `k == n`, `res` will be `[1] * n`.
- If `k == 1`, `res` will be `range(n)`, which will be printed as `0 1 2 ... (n-1)`.
- If `k != n` and `k != 1`, `res` will be `[-1]`.

Since the values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we need to consider the general cases:
- If `k == n`, the output will be a list of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, the output will be `-1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and `k`, we can only provide the general form of the output based on the conditions.

Output: **[1] * n (if k == n), 0 1 2 ... (n-1) (if k == 1), or -1 (if k != n and k != 1)**
