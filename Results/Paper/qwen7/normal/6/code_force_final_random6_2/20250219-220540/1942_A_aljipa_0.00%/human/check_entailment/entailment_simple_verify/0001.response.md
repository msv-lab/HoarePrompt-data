### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It then constructs the result list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`:
     - If \(k == n\), it creates an array with all elements equal to `1`.
     - If \(k == 1\), it creates an array where the elements are a range from `0` to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating that no valid array can be constructed.

3. **Checking the Validity of the Solution:**
   - **Case \(k == n\):**
     - An array with all elements equal to `1` will indeed have all cyclic shifts sorted.
     - This is correct because every cyclic shift of `[1, 1, ..., 1]` is `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, which is sorted.
   - **Case \(k == 1\):**
     - An array with elements `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one cyclic shift sorted.
     - Specifically, the shift starting at index `n-1` will be sorted: `[n-1, 0, 1, ..., n-2]`.
     - All other shifts will not be sorted.
   - **Case \(k != n\) and \(k != 1\):**
     - However, setting `res` to `[-1]` is not always correct. Consider the following counterexample:
       - For \(n = 3\) and \(k = 2\), the array `[1, 2, 3]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 1]`. The third cyclic shift `[3, 1, 2]` is not sorted.
     - Therefore, the provided solution fails to handle this case correctly.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution correctly handles the cases where \(k == n\) and \(k == 1\), but it fails to provide a valid array for other cases where such an array might exist.

### Correctness:
**False**
