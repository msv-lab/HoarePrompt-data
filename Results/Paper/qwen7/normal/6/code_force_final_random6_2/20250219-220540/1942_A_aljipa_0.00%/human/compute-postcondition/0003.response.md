Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

This means that the value of `res` depends on the condition of `k` relative to `n`. If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals `1`, `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` is a list containing only `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
