Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). Based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\), it generates a list `res` with specific configurations: if \(k = n\), `res` is a list of \(n\) ones; if \(k = 1\), `res` is a range of integers from 0 to \(n-1\); otherwise, `res` is a list containing a single `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the list `res` for each test case and sets the counter `t` to 0.**
