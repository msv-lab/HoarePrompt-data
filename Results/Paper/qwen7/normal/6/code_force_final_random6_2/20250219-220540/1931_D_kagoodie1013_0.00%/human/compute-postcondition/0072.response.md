Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `count` remains as `num % y` + 0, `arr` remains a non-empty list with at least one element where `num` is its first element, `mod_y_map` remains an empty dictionary, `results` remains a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, and `mod_y_key` is now explicitly set to `num % y`.
