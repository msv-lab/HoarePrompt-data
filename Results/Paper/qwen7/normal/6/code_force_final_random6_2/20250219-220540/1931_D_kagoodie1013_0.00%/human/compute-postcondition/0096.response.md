Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, it calculates a count value and stores the cumulative sum of these count values in a list called `results`. Finally, it returns the list `results`.**
