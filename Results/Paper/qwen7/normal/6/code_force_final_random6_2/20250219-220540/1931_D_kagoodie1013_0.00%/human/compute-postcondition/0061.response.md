Output State: `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`; `arr` is an empty list; `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries where keys are the possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and values are the counts of these remainders.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all iterations, `count` will hold the total sum of occurrences of each modulus key in both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. The lists `arr` will be empty as all elements have been processed. The dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each remainder when the elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
