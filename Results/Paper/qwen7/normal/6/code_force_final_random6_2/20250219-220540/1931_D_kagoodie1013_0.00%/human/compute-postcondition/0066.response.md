Output State: **`count` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `mod_y_map = {}` reassigns the variable `mod_y_map` to an empty dictionary. This overrides the previous state where `mod_y_map` was a dictionary with keys as remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and values as their counts. All other variables remain unchanged.
