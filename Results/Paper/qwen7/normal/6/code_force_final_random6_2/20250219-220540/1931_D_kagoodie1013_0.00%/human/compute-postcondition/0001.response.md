State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from test_cases**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each tuple in `test_cases`. Each tuple must contain three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
2. The variable names in the loop head are `(n, x, y, arr)`.
3. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `test_cases` that matches the structure `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a list of n integers.
4. Since `results` is initially an empty list, its state does not affect the loop's execution directly.
5. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to `test_cases` to ensure it contains at least one valid tuple, and the initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` within that tuple.

Hence, the final state is as described above.
