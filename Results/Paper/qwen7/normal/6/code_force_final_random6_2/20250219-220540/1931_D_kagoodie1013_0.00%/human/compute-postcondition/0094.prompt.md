Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` contains the final value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for every `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each modulus result for `x` across all elements in `arr`, `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each modulus result for `y` across all elements in `arr`, `arr` retains its initial list of tuples, and `num` is the last element processed in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is an empty list; `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries where keys are the possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and values are the counts of these remainders; `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`; `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count` is the sum of `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3 + the sum of all `mod_x_key` values from `arr` modulo `x` + the sum of all `mod_y_key` values from `arr` modulo `y`; `arr` is an empty list; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with all keys from `arr` modulo `y` mapped to their respective counts; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with all keys from `arr` modulo `x` mapped to their respective counts; `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
