Output State: The final state of the loop will include the following:

- `count` will be the sum of all values obtained from `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for every `num` in `arr`.
- `mod_x_map` will be a dictionary where each key is `num % x` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder has appeared in `arr`.
- `mod_y_map` will be a dictionary where each key is `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder has appeared in `arr`.
- `arr` will remain as it was initially provided, unchanged by the loop.
- `num` will be the last element processed in `arr`.

In summary, `count` will reflect the cumulative sum of occurrences of each modulo pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for every number in `arr`, while `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will store the frequency of each possible remainder when dividing elements of `arr` by `x` and `y`, respectively.
