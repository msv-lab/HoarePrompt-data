Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The `test_cases` variable remains unchanged as no operations are performed on its contents. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged `test_cases` and the newly initialized `results` list.
