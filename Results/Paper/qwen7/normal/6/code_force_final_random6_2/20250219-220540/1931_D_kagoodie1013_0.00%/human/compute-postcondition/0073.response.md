Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `mod_x_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of `mod_x_key` by 1. Since `mod_x_key` is the same as `mod_y_key`, which is `num % y`, the dictionary `mod_y_map` is updated to have `mod_y_key` mapped to 1 (if it was not already present). All other variables remain unchanged.
