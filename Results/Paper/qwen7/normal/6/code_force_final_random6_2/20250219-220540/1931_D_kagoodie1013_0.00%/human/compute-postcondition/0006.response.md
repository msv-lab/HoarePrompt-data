Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus of `-num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. Since `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is computed as `-num % x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
