Output State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x**.

Explanation: The line `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to be `num % x`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the updated value of `mod_x_key`.
