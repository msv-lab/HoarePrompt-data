Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then splits it into parts. This ensures that all test cases and their respective arrays are read correctly.
2. **Test Case Processing**: The program processes each test case by extracting the necessary parameters (n, x, y, and the array) and storing them in a list of tuples. This is done efficiently without unnecessary intermediate steps.
3. **Count Calculation**: For each test case, the program uses a dictionary-based approach to count the number of beautiful pairs:
   - It calculates the remainder of each element in the array when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It maintains two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of these remainders.
   - For each element, it updates the count of beautiful pairs based on the current counts in the dictionaries.
   - It also updates the dictionaries with the new remainder counts.
4. **Result Collection**: The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is collected in a list and returned.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program correctly implements the required logic to find the number of beautiful pairs. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
