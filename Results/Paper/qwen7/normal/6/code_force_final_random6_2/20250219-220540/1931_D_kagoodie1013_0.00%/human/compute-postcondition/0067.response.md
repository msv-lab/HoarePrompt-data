Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for num in arr:`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `count` is initially 0.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary (not directly involved in the loop head).
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count` (not directly involved in the loop head).

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `arr`.
   - The variable `num` will take each element from `arr` in sequence.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop will execute as long as `arr` contains elements, `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `arr` must be a non-empty list.
- `num` must be the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: **`count` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`**.
