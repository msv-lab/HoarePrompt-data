The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \)), and two strings \( a \) and \( b \), each consisting of exactly \( n \) lowercase Latin letters. It also accepts a third string \( c \) of the same length. The function checks if there exists any index \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) where both \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) and \( b[i] \neq c[i] \) are true. If such an index is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such index exists, the function returns 'NO', with the loop having completed all its iterations and the variable \( i \) set to \( n-1 \).
