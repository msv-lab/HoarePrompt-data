Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The other variables (`results`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
