The function processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). It then calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the return values in a list. Finally, it prints the return values of `func_1` for all test cases.
