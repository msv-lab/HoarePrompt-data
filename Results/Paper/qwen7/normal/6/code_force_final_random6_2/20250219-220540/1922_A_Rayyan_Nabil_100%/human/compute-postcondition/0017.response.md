Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and a new integer `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, while all other variables remain as described in the initial state.
