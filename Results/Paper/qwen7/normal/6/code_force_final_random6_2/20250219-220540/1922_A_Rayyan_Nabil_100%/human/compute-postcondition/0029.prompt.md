Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, with `c` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` being the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, representing the total number of iterations the loop will execute.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the first element in the `results` list, `t` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the second element in the `results` list, `t` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `result` is the third element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
