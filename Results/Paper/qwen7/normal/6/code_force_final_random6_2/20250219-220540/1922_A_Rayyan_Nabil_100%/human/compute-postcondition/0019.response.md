Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

The code `b = input().strip()` reads an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to `b`. The other variables (`results`, `c`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
