Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. The values of `c`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `t` must still be greater than 0. The precondition that `results` was initially a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is updated to include the return value of the function call appended to the list.
