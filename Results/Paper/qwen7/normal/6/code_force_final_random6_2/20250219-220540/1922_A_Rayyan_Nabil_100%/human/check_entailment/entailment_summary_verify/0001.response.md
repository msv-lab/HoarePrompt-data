### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - If a character in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
   - If a character in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of that character.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` currently checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This function only checks if `a` and `b` can potentially match the same template as `c` does not, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can indeed match a template while `c` cannot.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Checking the Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incomplete because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` can differ from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.
   - For example, consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     2
     aa
     bb
     aa
     ```
     Here, `a` and `b` are both "aa", and `c` is also "aa". According to the problem statement, `a` and `b` should match a template, and `c` should not. However, `func_1` will return 'NO' because `a` and `b` do not differ from `c`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` can match but `c` cannot.
   - One way to do this is to compare each character of `a` and `b` with `c` and ensure that for each position, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, then a template can be constructed.
   - Specifically, we need to check if there is a consistent way to assign lowercase and uppercase characters to the positions where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to iterate through each position and check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`.
   - If they are, we can construct a template where the character at that position is uppercase.
   - If there is no such position, then `a` and `b` cannot match a template while `c` cannot.

7. **Revised `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, a, b, c):
       for i in range(n):
           if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
               continue
           elif a[i] != b[i] or a[i] == c[i]:
               return 'NO'
       return 'YES'
   ```

8. **Revised `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2():
       t = int(input().strip())
       results = []
       for _ in range(t):
           n = int(input().strip())
           a = input().strip()
           b = input().strip()
           c = input().strip()
           results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
       for result in results:
           print(result)
   ```

9. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_2` processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). It then calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the return values in a list. Finally, it prints the return values of `func_1` for all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The current implementation in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not fully satisfy the conditions required by the problem. The revised `func_1` ensures that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
