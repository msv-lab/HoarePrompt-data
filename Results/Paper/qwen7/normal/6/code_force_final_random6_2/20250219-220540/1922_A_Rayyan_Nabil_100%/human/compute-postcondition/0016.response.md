Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in this loop are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop runs from `range(t)`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` has been decremented by 1.

**Final State**:
- `results` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `c` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` must now be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
