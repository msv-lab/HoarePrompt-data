Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `a` is reassigned to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

In this step, the code `a = input().strip()` reads an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `a`. The other variables (`results`, `c`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
