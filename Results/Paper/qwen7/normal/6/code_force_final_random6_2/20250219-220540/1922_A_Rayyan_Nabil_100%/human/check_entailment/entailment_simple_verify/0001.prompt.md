You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. For the loop to have completed all its iterations without returning 'YES', it must be true that for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` holds. If any index `i` from `0` to `n-1` satisfies both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, the function would have returned 'YES' before completing all iterations. Therefore, the function does not return 'YES' after all iterations, and the final state is that the loop has completed without interruption, with `i` set to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms: After running the loop through all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`. The function did not return 'YES' during these iterations, meaning for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, at least one of the conditions `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` is true.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', with i being equal to n-1 and the loop having completed all its iterations without finding any index where both a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] hold.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, with `c` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` being the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` being the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, representing the total number of iterations the loop will execute.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the 1000 iterations of the loop, `t` is 1000, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the last (1000th) element in the `results` list.
    #
    #In this final state, the `results` list will contain the return values from calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` exactly 1000 times, with `t` set to 1000 indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `c`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, since these values do not change within the loop. The `result` variable will hold the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the last iteration of the loop.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - If a character in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
   - If a character in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of that character.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This function only checks if `a` and `b` can potentially match the same template as `c` does not, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can indeed match a template while `c` cannot.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Checking the Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incomplete because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` can differ from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.
   - For example, consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     2
     aa
     bb
     aa
     ```
     Here, `a` and `b` are both "aa", and `c` is also "aa". According to the problem statement, `a` and `b` should match a template, and `c` should not. However, `func_1` will return 'NO' because `a` and `b` do not differ from `c`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` can match but `c` cannot.
   - One way to do this is to compare each character of `a` and `b` with `c` and ensure that for each position, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, then a template can be constructed.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not fully satisfy the conditions required by the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
