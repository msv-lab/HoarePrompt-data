Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the loop's execution.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `results` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already specified to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it inherently satisfies this condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

5. **Final state**: The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list**. 

Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the condition `t > 0` is always true. Thus, the final state can be simplified to:

**State: **`results` is an empty list**.
