Output State: **`position` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 1, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is now 0**.

Explanation: The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n`. This operation divides `n` by 2 and discards the remainder. Given that `n` was initially 1, shifting it right by 1 bit results in `n` becoming 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
