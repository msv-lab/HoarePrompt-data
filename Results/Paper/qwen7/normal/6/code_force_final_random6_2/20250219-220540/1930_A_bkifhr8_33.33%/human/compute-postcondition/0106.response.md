Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans_f` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is equal to an element in `ans_f`.

Since `ans_f` contains at least one element, `i` is assigned to one of those elements. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified because it could be any of the elements in `ans_f`.

Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print one of the elements from `ans_f`.

Output: **an element from ans_f**
