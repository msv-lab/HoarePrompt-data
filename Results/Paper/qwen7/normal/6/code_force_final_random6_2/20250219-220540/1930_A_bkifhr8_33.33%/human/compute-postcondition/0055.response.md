Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` has had its first element removed at index 0**.

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is the same as index `0`, from the list `lst`. The initial state of `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. After executing the code, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. However, the list `lst` has had its first element removed.
