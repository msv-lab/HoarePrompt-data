Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of List Length**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect because the list `lst` should be processed until it has less than 2 elements, not just check if its length is 2. This condition will cause the loop to break prematurely when there are still elements left to process.

2. **Indexing Issue**: The indexing logic in the loop `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect. It should simply remove the first two elements from the list without using multiplication which is unnecessary here.

3. **Logic for Pairs**: The program should always take the minimum of the first two elements and add it to the score, then remove those two elements from the list. This needs to be done iteratively until the list has fewer than 2 elements.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = 0
        while len(lst) >= 2:
            ans += min(lst[0], lst[1])
            del lst[0]  # Remove the first element
            del lst[0]  # Remove the second element
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum of the first two elements is added to the score and the elements are removed iteratively until the list has fewer than 2 elements.
