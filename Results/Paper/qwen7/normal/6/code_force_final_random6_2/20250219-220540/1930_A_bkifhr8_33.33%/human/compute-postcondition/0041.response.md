Output State: **`ans` is 0, `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**

The code splits the string `l` into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
