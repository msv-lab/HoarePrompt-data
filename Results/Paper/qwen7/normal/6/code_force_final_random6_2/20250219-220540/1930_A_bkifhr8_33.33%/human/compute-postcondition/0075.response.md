Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `l` into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `lst`. The values of `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
