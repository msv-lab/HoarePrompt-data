Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and `lst` has had its first element removed at index 0.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is index 0, from the list `lst`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` is still the original `ans` plus the minimum of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, but now `lst` has lost its first element.
