Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` after converting them to integers. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
