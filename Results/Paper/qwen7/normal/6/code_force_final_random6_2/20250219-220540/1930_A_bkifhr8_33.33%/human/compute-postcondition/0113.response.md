Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (number of test cases) and an integer n (number of pairs of integers), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs from the list of integers and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list.**
