Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, and `ans` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from the list `lst` until the list cannot be split into pairs or the loop has completed its iterations.**

Explanation: The line `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. This does not change the value of `ans` or `i`, but it adds the current value of `ans` to `ans_f`. The value of `i` remains `2 * n` as it was after the loop completed its iterations. The values of `lst` and the calculation process leading to `ans` are not directly shown here but are implied to have occurred during the loop iterations.
