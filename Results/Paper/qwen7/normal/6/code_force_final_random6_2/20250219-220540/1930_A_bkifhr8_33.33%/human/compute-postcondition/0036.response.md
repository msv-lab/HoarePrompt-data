Output State: **`ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, and `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations.**

This means that the code appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. The value of `ans` itself remains unchanged by this line of code, but it retains its value as the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst`, which was computed in the loop before this line. The list `ans_f` now includes this latest computed value of `ans`.
