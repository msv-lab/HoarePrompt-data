Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is an integer converted from the first word of the input split by space; `k` is an integer converted from the second word of the input split by space; `a` is a list containing two elements, both elements are integers, the first element is the first word of the input converted to an integer and the second element is the second word of the input converted to an integer; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (either `k - mi * 2` or remains unchanged), `l` and `r` are updated to 1 and `n - 2` respectively, `ans` is 1, and `a[r]` is 0 if the if condition is met. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, `t` is `k % 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n-3` or `n-2`, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `t` is `k % 2`, and if the if condition is met, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`. If the if condition is not met, `r` and `ans` remain unchanged, and `t` is set to `k % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 3 and `r` must be `n-3`, `ans` is either 5 or 4, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, and if `a[r]` equals 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
