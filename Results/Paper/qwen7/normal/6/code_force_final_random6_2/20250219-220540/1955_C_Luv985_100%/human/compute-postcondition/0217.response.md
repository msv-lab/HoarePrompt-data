Postcondition: `T` is -1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is either 1 or 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 2, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, and `mi` is updated to be the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.
