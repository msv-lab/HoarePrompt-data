Postcondition: **`T` is -1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(a[l], a[r])`, `l` is either 2 (if initially 1) or 1 (if initially 0), `mi` is `min(a[l] - mi, a[r] - mi)`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1, and `l` is adjusted to either 2 or 1 based on its initial value. In all cases, `a[r]` remains 0, and the other variables retain their specified values as per the if part.
