Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
