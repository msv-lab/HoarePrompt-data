Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted based on the if condition (either `k - 2 * mi` if the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is true, or remains unchanged if false), `l` is either `l + 1` less than `r` if `a[l]` equals 0, or remains unchanged otherwise, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.
