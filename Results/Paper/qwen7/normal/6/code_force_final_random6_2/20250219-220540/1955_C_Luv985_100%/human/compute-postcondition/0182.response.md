Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 0, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and the condition `l == r` is now false.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, where `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
