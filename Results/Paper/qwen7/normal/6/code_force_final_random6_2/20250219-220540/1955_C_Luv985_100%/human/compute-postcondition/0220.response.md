Postcondition: **`T` is -1, `r` is adjusted based on the initial value, `k` is updated accordingly, `l` is either 2 or 1, `mi` is updated to be the minimum of `a[l] - mi` and `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is either increased by 1 or 2, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, and `a[l]` is updated by subtracting `mi` from its original value.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block, considering the adjustments made to the variables based on whether the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is true or false.
