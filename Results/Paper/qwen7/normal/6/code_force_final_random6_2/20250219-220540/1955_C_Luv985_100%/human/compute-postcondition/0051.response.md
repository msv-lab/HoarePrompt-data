Postcondition: `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n-3`, `ans` is 3, where `l` is set to 2 if `a[1]` equals 0, otherwise `l` remains 1. If `a[r]` (which is `a[n-2]`) is 0, then `r` is set to `n-3`; otherwise, `r` remains `n-2`.
