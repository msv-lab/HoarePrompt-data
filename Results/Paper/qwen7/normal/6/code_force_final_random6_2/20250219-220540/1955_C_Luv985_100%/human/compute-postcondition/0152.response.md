Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)`, `l` is `l + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi` depending on the condition `a[r] == 0`.

This means that if `a[r] == 0`, then `r` is decremented by 1, `a[r]` is decreased by the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the other variables (`ans`, `T`, `k`, `mi`, `t`) retain their values as specified in the if part. If the condition `a[r] == 0` is not met, the values of `r`, `k`, `l`, `mi`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `a[r]` is decreased by the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
