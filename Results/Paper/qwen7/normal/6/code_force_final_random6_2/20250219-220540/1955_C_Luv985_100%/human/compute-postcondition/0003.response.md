Output State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\)**

Explanation: The value of `T` is decremented by 1. Since `T` was initially a positive integer between \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), after decrementing by 1, `T` now ranges from \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\). The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
