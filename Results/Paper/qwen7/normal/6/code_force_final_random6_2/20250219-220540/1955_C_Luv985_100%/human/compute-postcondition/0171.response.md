Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the value of input split converted to an integer, `l` is incremented by 1 for each zero encountered at position `l`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` (or `a[r - 1]` if `r` was decremented) at the end of the loop, and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi` if it was involved in the last subtraction. Additionally, the condition `l == r` is now false; `n` is now an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the value of `k` to an integer. Since `k` was previously assigned the value from input split, it is now the integer value of that input. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
