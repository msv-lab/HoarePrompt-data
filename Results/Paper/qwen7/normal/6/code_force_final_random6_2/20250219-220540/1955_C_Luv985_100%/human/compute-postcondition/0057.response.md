Postcondition: `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 2 if `a[1]` equals 0, otherwise `l` remains 1, `r` is `n-3` if `a[n-2]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains `n-2`, `ans` is 3 if the if condition is met (`mi * 2 <= k`), otherwise `ans` is 2, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else condition is met.
