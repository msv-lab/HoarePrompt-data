Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is adjusted according to the conditions (either `k - mi * 2` or `k % 2`), `mi` is updated to `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise it remains `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise it becomes `t + k // 2` where `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is set to `0` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise it remains `a[r]`, and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` equals 0 and `a[l]` is 0 after the update, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.
