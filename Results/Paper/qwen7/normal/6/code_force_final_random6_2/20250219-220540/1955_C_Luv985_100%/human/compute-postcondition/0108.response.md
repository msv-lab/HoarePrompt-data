Output State: **`ans` is 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `0`, `l` is `l + 1` if `a[l]` equals 0, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After executing the code, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
