Output State: **`a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
