Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq T \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` must be at least 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing two elements, both elements are integers, the first element is the first word of the input converted to an integer and the second element is the second word of the input converted to an integer; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 1; `t` is `k % 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
