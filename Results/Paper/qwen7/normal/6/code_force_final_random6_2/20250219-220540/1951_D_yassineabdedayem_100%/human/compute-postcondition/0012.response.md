Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.
- The value of `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

The `print(n - k + 1, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `n - k + 1`.

To determine the exact value, we need to know the specific values of `n` and `k` from the input. However, since those values are not provided, we can only describe the expression that will be evaluated.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers obtained from the input, with n â‰  k and n + 2 > k * 2)**
