Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input; `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial conditions regarding `t` and the relationship between `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
