Reasoning:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the condition when \( n = k \). In this case, it prints `YES` and `1`, which is correct because Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels if the price is set to 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program also correctly handles the condition when \( n + 2 > 2k \). Here, it prints `YES` and `2`, followed by \( n - k + 1 \) and `1`. This ensures that Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by buying from two stalls. The first stall will have a price of \( n - k + 1 \) coins, allowing Alice to buy just enough jewels to reach \( k \) total, and the second stall will have a price of 1 coin, ensuring she cannot buy more.
   - However, the program incorrectly handles other cases. Specifically, it always prints `NO` for any other scenario without considering if it's possible to achieve \( k \) jewels using up to 60 stalls. This is a flaw because there might be scenarios where setting up more than 2 stalls could allow Alice to buy exactly \( k \) jewels.

2. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `7 3`, the program correctly outputs `YES 1 1` because \( n = k \).
   - For the input `6 4`, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` because it doesn't consider the possibility of setting up stalls with different prices to achieve exactly 4 jewels.
   - For the input `255 8`, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` because it doesn't consider the possibility of setting up stalls with different prices to achieve exactly 8 jewels.

Given these points, the program is not fully correct as it fails to handle all cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
