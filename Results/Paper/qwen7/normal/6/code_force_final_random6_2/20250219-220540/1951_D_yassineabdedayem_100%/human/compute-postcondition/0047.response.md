Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and it must be a positive integer not exceeding 1000. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the last values read from the input during the loop's final iteration. The output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each iteration, followed by either '1', '2', or no additional output depending on the conditions met in the loop. Specifically, if `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES 1 1'. If `n + 2` is greater than `2k`, it prints 'YES 2' followed by `n - k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This output state reflects the cumulative effect of the loop running its full course, with `t` iterations completed, and the final values of `n` and `k` being those from the last input line processed.
