Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: It is given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and this value is an integer between 1 and 1000.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
