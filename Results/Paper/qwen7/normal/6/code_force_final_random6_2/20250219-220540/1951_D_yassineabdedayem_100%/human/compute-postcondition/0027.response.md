Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.
- `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.

The `print(2)` statement will simply print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **2**
