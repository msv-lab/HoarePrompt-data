Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the first and second space-separated values in input respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.
