Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is.
   - Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition holds as is.
   - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not change within the loop.
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - The loop itself does not modify `t`, `n`, or `k`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop does not modify `t`, `n`, or `k`, these values remain the same for each iteration.
   - The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left, which is represented by `t`.

5. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` decreases by 1 because one iteration of the loop has completed.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
