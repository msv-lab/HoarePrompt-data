Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.
