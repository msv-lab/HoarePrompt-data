Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.
- Both `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter). Since `n` and `k` are obtained from the input, their exact values depend on the input provided, but the operation `n - k + 1` will be performed with those values.

Therefore, the output will be the result of `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1 (followed by a space)**
