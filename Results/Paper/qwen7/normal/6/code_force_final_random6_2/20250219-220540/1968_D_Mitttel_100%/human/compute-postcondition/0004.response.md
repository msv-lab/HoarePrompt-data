Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while not vis[s] and k > 0:`. The variables involved are `vis[s]` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `not vis[s]` and `k > 0` are both true.
   - `not vis[s]` means that `vis[s]` should be `False`.
   - `k > 0` means that `k` should be greater than 0.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `mx` is 0 (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `cur` is 0 (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `vis` is a list of `n` elements, each element being 0. This means `vis[s]` is `False` because all elements in `vis` are initially set to 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `vis[s]` is already `False` (which satisfies `not vis[s]`), no adjustment is needed for `vis[s]`.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The current state does not provide information about the initial value of `k`, but we know it needs to be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time is that `k` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
