Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a given starting position `s` over `k` turns. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the loop should consider the sequence of moves and the corresponding scores correctly, but it only considers one path without exploring all possible paths.

2. **Starting Position Adjustment**: The starting positions `pb` and `ps` are adjusted by subtracting 1, which is correct. However, the function `func_1` should also handle these adjustments properly.

3. **Game Logic**: The main part of the program assumes that `func_1` returns the maximum score for the given starting position. This assumption is correct, but the implementation of `func_1` needs to be corrected to ensure it explores all possible paths correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function that properly handles the game logic:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    stack = [(s, k)]
    visited = [0] * n
    while stack:
        pos, remaining_turns = stack.pop()
        if visited[pos]:
            continue
        visited[pos] = 1
        cur += a[pos]
        mx = max(mx, cur)
        if remaining_turns > 0:
            stack.append((p[pos], remaining_turns - 1))
            stack.append((pos, remaining_turns - 1))
    return mx
```

With this corrected `func_1` function, the overall logic of the program should work as intended. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`.
