Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a permutation `p`, a list of starting positions `s`, and a non-negative integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` based on the permutation `p` starting from the positions specified in `s`. During each iteration, it calculates the value of `cur + k * a[s]` and updates the maximum value found (`mx`). It also keeps track of visited positions in the `vis` list. After all iterations, it returns the maximum value found (`mx`).**
