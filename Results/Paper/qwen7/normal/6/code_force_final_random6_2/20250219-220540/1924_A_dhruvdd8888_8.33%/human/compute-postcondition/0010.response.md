Output State: **`i` is added to the list `ans`, the set `win` is unchanged, and the set `us` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `ans`. The sets `win` and `us` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The length of the set `win` being equal to `k` remains true, and `i` is still in the set `us`.
