Output State: **`win` is a set containing the elements `i` and `i`, `s` is the original string, `us` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, and `ans` now contains the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is already present in `ans`, appending it again does not change the set representation of `ans`. All other variables (`win`, `s`, `us`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
