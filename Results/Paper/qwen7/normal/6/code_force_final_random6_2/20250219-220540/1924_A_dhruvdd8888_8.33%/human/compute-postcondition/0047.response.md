Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in us`. The variables involved here are `i` and `us`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `us` must contain at least one character, and `i` must be an element of `win`. This means that `us` should still contain at least one character, and `i` should still be an element of `win`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since the loop is iterating over each character in `us`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `us`. However, the postcondition requires that `us` must still contain at least one character, and `i` must still be an element of `win`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `us` still contains at least one character and `i` is still an element of `win`.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `us` must contain at least one character, and `i` must be an element of `win`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `us` must still contain at least one character (since `i` will be the next character in `us`).
- `i` must still be an element of `win` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`us` must contain at least one character, and `i` must be an element of `win`**.
