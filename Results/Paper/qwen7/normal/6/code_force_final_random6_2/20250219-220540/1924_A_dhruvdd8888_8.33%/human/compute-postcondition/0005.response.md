Output State: **`ps` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ps` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
