Output State: **`win` is a set containing the elements `i` and `i`, `s` is the original string, `us` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, and `ps` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `win.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `win`. Since sets in Python do not allow duplicate elements, adding `i` again does not change the set `win`. Therefore, `win` now contains both instances of `i`. The other variables (`s`, `us`, `ans`, and `ps`) remain unchanged.
