Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`, and `i` is in the set of characters `us`.**

The code `win.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `win`. Since `i` is the first character of the string `s` and `i` is in the set of characters `us`, after executing the code, `i` will be added to the set `win`, and `i` will still be in the set of characters `us`.
