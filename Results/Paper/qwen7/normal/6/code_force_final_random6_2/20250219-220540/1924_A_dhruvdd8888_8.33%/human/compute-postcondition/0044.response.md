Based on the initial state provided:

- `us` must contain at least one character.
- `i` must be an element of `win`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`''.join(ans)`**: This part of the code joins the elements of the list `ans` into a single string. Since the value of `ans` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact string it forms. We will denote this joined string as `joined_ans`.

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is mentioned to be an element of `win`. The exact value of `i` is not provided, so we will keep it as `i`.

3. **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**: This part generates a string consisting of `n - len(ans) - 1` number of 'a' characters. Again, since `ans` and `n` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact number of 'a' characters. We will denote this string as `a_string`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will concatenate `joined_ans`, `i`, and `a_string`.

Output: **joined_ans + i + a_string (where `joined_ans` is the result of ''.join(ans), `i` is an element of `win`, and `a_string` is a string of 'a' characters with length `n - len(ans) - 1`)**
