Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to find the position where a value `x` would be inserted into a sorted list `a` using binary search.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where `x` is not found in the list properly. It returns the insertion point if `x` is not found, but it does not handle the case where `x` is less than the smallest element in the list (`a[0]`).
   - The function should return `-1` if `x` is less than the smallest element in `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
   - It uses two lists: `left` and `last`.
     - `left[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the sizes up to index `i-1`.
     - `last[i]` stores the last occurrence of the size `a[i-1]`.
   - For each slime at index `i`, it checks if the slime can eat its left neighbor (`a[i] > a[i-1]`). If so, it calculates the time taken to eat the left neighbor.
   - It also checks if the slime can eat its right neighbor by finding the last occurrence of the same size and calculating the time taken to eat the right neighbor.
   - The function returns a list `ans` where `ans[i]` is the minimum number of seconds it takes for the slime at index `i` to be eaten.

### Issues Identified

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is less than the smallest element in `a`. It should return `-1` in such cases.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic for determining if a slime can eat its right neighbor is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the possibility of multiple slimes of the same size.
   - The calculation of `inx` and `inx2` may not always give the correct result because it does not consider the possibility of multiple slimes of the same size.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness

**False**
