Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the last element of `left` plus `i` to the list `left`. Since `i` is the second element of `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list, `i` retains its original value. The value of `left` is updated, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `left` list and retains the unchanged states of `last`, `ans`, and `i`.
