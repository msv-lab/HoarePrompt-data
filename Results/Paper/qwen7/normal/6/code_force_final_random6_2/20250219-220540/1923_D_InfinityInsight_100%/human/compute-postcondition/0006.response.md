Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0 and 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to both `last` and `left` lists. After the operation, `left` contains `[0, 2]` and `last` contains `[-1, 2]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, and the condition about `a[i]` remain unchanged.
