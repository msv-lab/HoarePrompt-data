Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, and 3, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `last`. After appending, `last` now contains -1, -1, and 3. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
