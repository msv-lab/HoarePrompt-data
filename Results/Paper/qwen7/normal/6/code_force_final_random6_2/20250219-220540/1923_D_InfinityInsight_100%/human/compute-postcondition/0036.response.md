Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than the previous value `a[i - 1]`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, all the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
