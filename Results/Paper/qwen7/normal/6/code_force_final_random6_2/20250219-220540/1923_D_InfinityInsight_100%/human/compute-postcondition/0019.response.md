Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the `last` list to itself. Initially, `last` is a list containing `-1` and `-1`. After appending the last element (`-1`) to itself, `last` becomes a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
