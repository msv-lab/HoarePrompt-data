You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The `last` list will contain `-1` repeated until the final index, which will be `n-1`, because each time `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` appends the current index `i`. The `left` list remains unchanged as it only gets updated under specific conditions that are not met here. The `ans` list remains a list of length `n` filled with -1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run through all iterations.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 0 (since `i` will be set to 0 after the loop ends), `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i` for each iteration.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element because the loop appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` in each iteration. The `last` list will still contain `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`, and `ans` will remain a list of length `n` filled with -1.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.

    return ans
    #`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` with specific values at indices 2, 3, and 4, sets `i` to 0, initializes `left` as the cumulative sum of `a`, and updates `last` to contain `-1` repeated. The original list `a` and integer `n` remain unchanged.

Return Postconditions: `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
