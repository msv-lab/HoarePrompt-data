Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is the first element of `a`, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i`.**

Explanation: The code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends to the list `left` the value of its last element (`left[-1]`) plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is a valid integer. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
