You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.

The `ans` list remains a list of length `n` filled with -1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run through all iterations.

    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element because the loop appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` in each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` with specific values at indices 2, 3, and 4, sets `i` to 0, and calculates the cumulative sum of all elements in `a`. Additionally, it updates two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to maintain certain states during the process. The original list `a` and integer `n` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
   - A slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - The process continues until no slime can eat any of its neighbors anymore.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a slime to be eaten, it must have a neighbor that is smaller.
   - The position of the next smaller neighbor can be tracked using the `last` array, which stores the index of the last occurrence of the current value.
   - The `left` array keeps track of the cumulative sum of the sizes up to the current index.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function performs a binary search to find the index where the element `x` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - It returns the index of the element in `a` that is just greater than or equal to `x`.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Initializes the `left` and `last` arrays.
   - Iterates through the list `a` to fill the `last` array with the index of the last occurrence of each value.
   - Uses the `left` array to compute the cumulative sum of sizes.
   - For each slime, it checks if it can eat its left or right neighbor.
   - If it can eat a neighbor, it calculates the time taken based on the cumulative sums and the `last` array.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Initialization:**
  - `left` array is initialized with `[0]`.
  - `last` array is initialized with `[-1]`.

- **Building the `last` Array:**
  - For each index `i`, if `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]`, update `last[i]` to `i`.
  - Otherwise, set `last[i]` to `last[i-1]`.

- **Building the `left` Array:**
  - For each index `i`, append `left[i-1] + a[i]` to `left`.

- **Eating Logic:**
  - For each slime at index `i`, check if it can eat its left neighbor (`a[i] > a[i-1]`).
  - Calculate the cumulative sum `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
  - Use `func_1` to find the index `inx` where `x` would fit in the `left` array.
  - Check if `inx` is valid and update the answer accordingly.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly handle the conditions for a slime to eat another slime.
- The use of `last` and `left` arrays helps in efficiently determining the next possible eating opportunity.
- The binary search in `func_1` is used appropriately to find the correct position in the `left` array.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
