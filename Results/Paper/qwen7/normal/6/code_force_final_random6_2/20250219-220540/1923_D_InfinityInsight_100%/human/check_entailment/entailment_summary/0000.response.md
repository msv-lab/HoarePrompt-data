Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and behavior of the provided functions, particularly `func_1` and `func_2`, and ensure they collectively meet the problem description.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
   - A slime can only eat a neighboring slime if it is strictly larger.
   - If no slime can eat another, the process stops.
   - For each slime, we need to output the minimum time it takes to be eaten or -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function searches for the first occurrence of a value in the list `a`.
   - If the value is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence plus one.
   - If the value is not found, it returns -1.
   - This function is used to find positions in the cumulative sum list `left`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - It uses two auxiliary lists: `left` and `last`.
   - `left` stores the cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes up to each position.
   - `last` keeps track of the last position where the size was different from the current position.
   - The function iterates through the slimes and checks if the current slime can eat its left neighbor.
   - If it can, it calculates the time using the cumulative sums and the `func_1` function.
   - It also handles cases where the current slime cannot eat its left neighbor but can eat its right neighbor after some other slimes have been eaten.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program runs multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` twice: once forward and once backward.
   - It then compares the results and takes the minimum value for each slime, ensuring correctness even if the process is not symmetric.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Each part of the code aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
