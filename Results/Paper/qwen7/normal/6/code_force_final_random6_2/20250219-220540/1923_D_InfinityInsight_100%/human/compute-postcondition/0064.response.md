Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is 4 - `inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; if `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` equals `inx2`. The loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of `ans` and the condition involving `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged.
