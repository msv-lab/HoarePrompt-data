Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `ans[i]` is 1. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
