Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `inx` is equal to `inx2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. Since `inx2` was previously defined, `inx` now holds the same value as `inx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
