Output State: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, and the index of the last element where `a[i]` was not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The `last` list will contain -1 and -1, followed by the index of the last element where `a[i]` was not equal to `a[i - 1]`. The `left` list will either contain 0 or 2 depending on whether there were any changes in the sequence `a`. The `ans` list remains unchanged, being a list of length `n` filled with -1.
