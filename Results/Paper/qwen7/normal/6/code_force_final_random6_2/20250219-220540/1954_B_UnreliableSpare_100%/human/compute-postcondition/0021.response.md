Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` must be greater than 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `arr[i]` must not be equal to `arr[i-1]`. The variable `flag` remains False throughout the entire loop execution.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements in the list `arr` up to the second last element. The condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` was met for every iteration from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and since `flag` was set to `False` and then never changed, it will still be `False` after the loop finishes.
