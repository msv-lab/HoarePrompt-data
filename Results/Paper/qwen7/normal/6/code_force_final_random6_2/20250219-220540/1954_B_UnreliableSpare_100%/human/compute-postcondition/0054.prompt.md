You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` must be greater than 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `arr[i]` must not be equal to `arr[i-1]`. The variable `flag` remains False throughout the entire loop execution.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `cnt` retains its final value after the last iteration, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` found during the loop execution, and `flag` remains `False` throughout the entire loop execution.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between ans and cnt after the loop has completed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array `a` is considered beautiful. Based on these inputs, the function returns information about the beautiful array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
