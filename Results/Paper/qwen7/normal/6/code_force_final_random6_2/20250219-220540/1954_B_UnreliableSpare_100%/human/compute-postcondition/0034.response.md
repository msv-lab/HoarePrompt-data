Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - The loop condition `i < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `n`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cnt` and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop itself but by the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact state of `cnt` and `ans` without knowing the loop body. However, they remain the same as their postconditions from the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to `n`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `cnt` and `ans` remain the same as their postconditions from the previous iteration

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0**
