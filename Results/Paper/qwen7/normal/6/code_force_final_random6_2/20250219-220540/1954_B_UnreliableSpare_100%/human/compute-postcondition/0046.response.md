Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `cnt` retains its final value after the last iteration, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` found during the loop execution, and `flag` remains `False` throughout the entire loop execution.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `flag` remains `False` as per the given conditions. The variable `cnt` will retain its value from the last iteration, which is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` up to the last element checked. The variable `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` found during the entire loop execution.
