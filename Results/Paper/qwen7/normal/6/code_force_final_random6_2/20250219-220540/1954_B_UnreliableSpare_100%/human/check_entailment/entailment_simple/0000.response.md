### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Checking for Non-Brittleness**:
   - A flag `flag` is used to check if the array is already non-brittle (i.e., no two adjacent elements are the same). This is done by iterating through the array and checking if any element is different from its predecessor.
   - If the array is non-brittle, the function prints `-1` immediately, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - If the array is brittle, the function calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-brittle.
   - It initializes `val` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count consecutive occurrences of `val`.
   - As it iterates through the array, it updates `cnt` and `ans` to find the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of `val`.
   - After the loop, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the array is always beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 â‹… 10^5`.
   - The logic handles arrays of size 1 correctly by setting `ans` to 0 (though this is not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the logic).

Given the above points, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-brittle, or prints `-1` if it is already non-brittle.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
