Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the value at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is not defined before this line, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `ans` is now the smaller of its original value and `cnt`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the value at index `i` in `arr`) remain unchanged.
