Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Identification of Beautiful Array**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If the array is uniform, it incorrectly prints `-1`. However, the problem statement specifies that the given array is always beautiful, so this check is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The logic to find the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The current implementation tries to count consecutive elements that are the same but does not correctly handle the condition where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing specific elements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the longest subsequence that can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment where the array is beautiful
        max_beautiful_length = 0
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                max_beautiful_length = max(max_beautiful_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1
        
        max_beautiful_length = max(max_beautiful_length, current_length)
        
        # If the entire array is beautiful, we need to remove all but one element
        if max_beautiful_length == n:
            print(n - 1)
        else:
            print(n - max_beautiful_length)

```

This approach works as follows:
1. Traverse the array to find the longest segment where the array is beautiful.
2. If the entire array is beautiful, the minimum number of removals needed is `n - 1`.
3. Otherwise, the minimum number of removals needed is `n - max_beautiful_length`.

This solution ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
