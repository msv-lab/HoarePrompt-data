Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.
   - `flag` remains False.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is now 2, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2.

5. **Maintaining Other States**:
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]` must still hold true for `i = 2`. This means `arr[2]` should not be equal to `arr[1]`.
   - `flag` remains False because there is no else part in the if statement, and the condition for changing `flag` is not met.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` remains False**.
