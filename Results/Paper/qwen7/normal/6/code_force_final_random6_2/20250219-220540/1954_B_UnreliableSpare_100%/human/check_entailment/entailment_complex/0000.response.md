Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by checking if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), and if so, printing -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
3. The logic in `func_1()` is as follows:
   - It first checks if the array is uniform by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - If the array is uniform (`flag` is `True`), it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
4. The code correctly handles the constraints and logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies when the array is uniform and when it is not, and it correctly computes the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-uniform.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
