Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` after the operation.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged unless specified by the condition in the problem statement. The value of `ans` is now updated to ensure it is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
