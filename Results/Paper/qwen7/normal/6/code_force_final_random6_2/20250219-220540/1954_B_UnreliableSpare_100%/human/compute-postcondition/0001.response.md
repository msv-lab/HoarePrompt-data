Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, arr is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This results in the creation of the list `arr` containing integers. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
