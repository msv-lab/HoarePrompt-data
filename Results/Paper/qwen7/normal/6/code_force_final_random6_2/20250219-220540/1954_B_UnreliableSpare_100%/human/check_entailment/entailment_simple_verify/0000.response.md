### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to understand its behavior and correctness:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes a boolean flag `flag` to check if the array is already beautiful.

2. **Checking if Array is Beautiful:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If it finds such a pair, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This ensures that if the array is already beautiful, `flag` will be `False`.

3. **Counting Minimum Removals:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity.
   - It iterates through the array to count the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of the same value (`val`).
   - If it encounters a different value, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far and resets the count.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count of consecutive occurrences.

4. **Output:**
   - If `flag` is `True`, it means the array is already beautiful, and the program prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition, which is stored in `ans`.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is read and the loop starts for each test case.
  - `n` and `arr` are read for the current test case.
  - `flag` is initialized to `True`.

- **Checking Beauty Condition:**
  - The loop checks if any two consecutive elements are different.
  - If such a pair is found, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
  - This ensures that if the array is already beautiful, `flag` will be `False`.

- **Counting Consecutive Occurrences:**
  - `ans` is initialized to infinity.
  - `val` is set to the first element of the array.
  - A loop iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of `val`.
  - If a different value is encountered, `ans` is updated with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far, and the count is reset.
  - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time with the final count of consecutive occurrences.

- **Output:**
  - If `flag` is `True`, the array is already beautiful, and `-1` is printed.
  - Otherwise, the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition is printed.

### Conclusion:

The annotated code correctly identifies and handles the beauty condition of the array. It correctly counts the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
