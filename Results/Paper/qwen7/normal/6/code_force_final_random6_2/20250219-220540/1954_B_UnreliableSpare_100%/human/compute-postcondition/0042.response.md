Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` retains its value, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` retains its value and `ans` is updated to the smaller of the two values, the output state reflects this change while keeping other variables unchanged.
