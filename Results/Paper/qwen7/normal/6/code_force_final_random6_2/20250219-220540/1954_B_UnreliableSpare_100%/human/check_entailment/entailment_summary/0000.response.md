Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It checks if the array is beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. This is done using the `flag` variable, which is set to `False` if any element differs from its predecessor.
3. If the array is beautiful, the program correctly outputs `-1`, as specified in the problem statement.
4. If the array is not beautiful, the program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements. This is done by maintaining a counter (`cnt`) and updating the minimum count (`ans`) whenever a different element is encountered.
5. The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is correct. It correctly identifies the minimum segment size where elements are the same before a different element appears.
6. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
