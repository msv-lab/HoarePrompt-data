Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` is False**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `flag` to `False`. Since the initial state already specifies that `flag` is `False`, the assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged according to their initial states.
