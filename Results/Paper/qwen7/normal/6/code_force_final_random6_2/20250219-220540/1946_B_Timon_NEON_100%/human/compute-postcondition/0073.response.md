Output State: **`total_max_segment` is now equal to the length of the next `segment` in `segments_variants`, and the length of the next `segment` is not 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_max_segment` to be equal to the length of the next `segment` in `segments_variants`. The condition that the length of the next `segment` is not 1 remains unchanged.
