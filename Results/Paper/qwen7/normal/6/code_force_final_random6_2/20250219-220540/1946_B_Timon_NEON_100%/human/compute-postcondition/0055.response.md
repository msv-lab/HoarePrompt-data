Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]'` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i-1]`. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, and `max_segment` remains unchanged.
