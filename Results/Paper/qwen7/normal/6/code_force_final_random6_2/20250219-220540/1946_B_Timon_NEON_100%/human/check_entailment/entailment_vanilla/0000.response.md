Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The solution should output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1(number)**: This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is correctly implemented.
   - **func_2(arr)**: This function aims to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array. However, the implementation has several issues:
     - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` but does not properly update them. The logic for updating these variables is flawed.
     - The function does not handle negative sums appropriately. It should consider the maximum sum segment including negative numbers.
     - The function appends multiple segments to `segments_variants` without checking if they are actually valid or better than the current `max_segment`.
     - The function does not return the correct segment; instead, it returns a list `[total_max_segment[0]]`, which is incorrect.
   - **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is not used in the provided code and is not relevant to solving the problem. It is incorrectly defined and should be removed or corrected.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the program is not correctly solving the problem as intended. The logic for finding the maximum sum segment is flawed, and the function does not return the correct segment.

Correctness: **False**
