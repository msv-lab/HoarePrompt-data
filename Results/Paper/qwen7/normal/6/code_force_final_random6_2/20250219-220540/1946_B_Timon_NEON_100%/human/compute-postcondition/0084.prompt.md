You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is a list containing all the segments that meet the criteria defined in the loop. Each segment in `segments_variants` is a list where the first element is the sum of the segment and the second element is the end index of the segment. `new_segment` is an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new maximum segment is found. `max_segment` contains the sum and end index of the current maximum segment found throughout the array. `max_sum` remains -1 because it is not used or updated within the loop. The value of `arr` remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. `i` will be equal to the length of `arr` after the loop completes.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments from the array `arr` where the sum of the segment elements is maximized compared to previously found segments, and `new_segment` and `max_segment` will reflect the current best segment found during the iteration of the array.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `total_max_segment` now contains the segment with the highest first element from `segments_variants` where the length of the segment is not 1. All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their final states after the third iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element, provided that the segment's length is greater than 1. The other variables will retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.
    return total_max_segment
    #`total_max_segment` contains the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element and a length greater than 1, while `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i` retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the segment with the largest first element that has a length greater than 1, while retaining specific variables' values from after the third iteration of a loop.

```

Return Postconditions: `total_max_segment` contains the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element and a length greater than 1, while `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i` retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
