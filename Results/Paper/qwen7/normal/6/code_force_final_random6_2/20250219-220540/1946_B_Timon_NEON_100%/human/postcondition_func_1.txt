The function `func_2` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the segment from `segments_variants` that has the largest first element (sum of segment elements) and a length greater than 1. During its execution, it identifies and stores all segments that meet certain criteria, updates the maximum segment found so far, and finally selects the segment with the highest sum from these candidates. The function does not modify the input list `arr`. Variables such as `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and the loop index `i` retain their values from after the third iteration of the loop.
