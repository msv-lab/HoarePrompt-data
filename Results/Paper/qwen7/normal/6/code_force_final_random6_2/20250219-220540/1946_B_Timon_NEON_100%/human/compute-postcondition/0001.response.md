The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer representing the sum of the original array, and `quantity`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations (k). The function does not specify a return value directly from the given information. However, based on the parameters, it seems the function might modify or process the `number` based on the `quantity`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of the original array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations. It processes `number` based on `quantity` but does not explicitly return a value.**
