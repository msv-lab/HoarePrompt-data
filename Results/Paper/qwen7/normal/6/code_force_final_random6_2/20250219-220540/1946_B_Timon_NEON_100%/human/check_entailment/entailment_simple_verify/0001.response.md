### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The solution should output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1(number)**: This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is correctly implemented.
   - **func_2(arr)**: This function aims to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array. Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:
     - **Initialization**: The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` but does not properly update them. The logic for updating these variables is flawed.
     - **Handling Negative Sums**: The function does not handle negative sums appropriately. It should consider the maximum sum segment including negative numbers.
     - **Appending Segments**: The function appends multiple segments to `segments_variants` without checking if they are actually valid or better than the current `max_segment`. This can lead to incorrect results.
     - **Returning the Correct Segment**: The function does not return the correct segment; instead, it returns a list `[total_max_segment[0]]`, which is incorrect. It should return the segment itself, not just its sum.
   - **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is not used in the provided code and is not relevant to solving the problem. It is incorrectly defined and should be removed or corrected.

Let's go through the annotated code to validate the original assessment:

- **func_2(arr)**:
  - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` but does not update them correctly. For example, if `arr[i] < 0`, it should check if adding `arr[i]` to `new_segment` or `max_segment` results in a larger sum.
  - The function appends multiple segments to `segments_variants` without checking if they are valid or better than the current `max_segment`. This can lead to incorrect results.
  - The function returns `[total_max_segment[0]]`, which is incorrect. It should return the segment itself, not just its sum.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the program is not correctly solving the problem as intended. The logic for finding the maximum sum segment is flawed, and the function does not return the correct segment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum segment, and the overall logic of the program is flawed.

**Final: False**
