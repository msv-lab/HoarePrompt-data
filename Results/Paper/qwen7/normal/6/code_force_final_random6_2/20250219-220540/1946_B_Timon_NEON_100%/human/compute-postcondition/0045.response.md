Output State: **`segments_variants` is now a list containing the original elements plus one additional element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list, which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_sum`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
