Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that the maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - The function `func_1` computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly iterates through the array to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - It handles both positive and negative subarray sums effectively.
   - The logic to update `max_segment` and `new_segment` ensures that the maximum subarray sum is tracked correctly.

4. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It takes the computed sum and applies the required modulo operation.

5. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the maximum subarray sum.
   - It calculates the final result using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like empty subarrays and negative sums appropriately.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
