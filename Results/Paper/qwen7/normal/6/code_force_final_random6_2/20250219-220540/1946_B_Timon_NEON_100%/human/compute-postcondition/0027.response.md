Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using `i`.
   - `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `len(arr)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `segments_variants`: A list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`.
   - `new_segment`: An empty list.
   - `max_segment`: Updated accordingly based on comparisons.
   - `max_sum`: Remains -1.
   - `arr`: Remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was used in the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `i` will now be `i + 1`.
   - `new_segment` remains an empty list since it is reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration.
   - `max_segment` remains as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i + 1]` is less than 0, but since we don't know the value of `arr[i + 1]` yet, we assume it remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `new_segment` remains an empty list.
   - `max_segment` remains as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains unchanged.**
