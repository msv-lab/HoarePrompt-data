Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `new_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
