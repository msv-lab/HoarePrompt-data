Output State: `segments_variants` is a list containing all the segments that meet the criteria defined in the loop. Each segment in `segments_variants` is a list where the first element is the sum of the segment and the second element is the end index of the segment. `new_segment` is an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new maximum segment is found. `max_segment` contains the sum and end index of the current maximum segment found throughout the array. `max_sum` remains -1 because it is not used or updated within the loop. The value of `arr` remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. `i` will be equal to the length of `arr` after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments from the array `arr` where the sum of the segment elements is maximized compared to previously found segments, and `new_segment` and `max_segment` will reflect the current best segment found during the iteration of the array.
