Output State: `segments_variants` is a list containing all valid segment variants found during the loop's execution, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` contains the maximum sum segment found, and `max_sum` remains -1. The exact contents of `segments_variants` and `max_segment` depend on the input array `arr`.

In more detail:
- `segments_variants` will include all segments that were considered as potential candidates for the maximum sum segment.
- `new_segment` is always an empty list when the loop completes because it is reset whenever a new segment is added to `segments_variants`.
- `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found throughout the loop's execution.
- `max_sum` remains -1 because the problem does not specify any condition to update `max_sum` other than using it to compare with `max_segment[0]`.
- The state of `arr` remains unchanged as the loop only modifies internal variables and does not alter the input array.
