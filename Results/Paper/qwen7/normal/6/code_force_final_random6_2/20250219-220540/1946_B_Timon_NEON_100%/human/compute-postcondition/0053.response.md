Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
