Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]'` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
