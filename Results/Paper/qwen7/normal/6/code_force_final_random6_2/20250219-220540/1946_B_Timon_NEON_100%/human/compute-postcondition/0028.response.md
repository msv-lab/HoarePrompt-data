Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`.
3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is updated accordingly.
   - `max_sum` remains `-1`.
   - `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(len(arr))`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `arr`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
