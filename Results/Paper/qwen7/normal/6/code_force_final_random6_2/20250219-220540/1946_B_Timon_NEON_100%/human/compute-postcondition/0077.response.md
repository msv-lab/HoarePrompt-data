Output State: **`total_max_segment` is equal to the current `segment`, and the length of the next `segment` in `segments_variants` is not 1, and `segments_variants` must have at least one segment left.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. The length of the next `segment` in `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `segments_variants` still has at least one segment left.
