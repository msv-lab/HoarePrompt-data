Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0 + arr[i], 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is not an empty list, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment[0]**.

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
