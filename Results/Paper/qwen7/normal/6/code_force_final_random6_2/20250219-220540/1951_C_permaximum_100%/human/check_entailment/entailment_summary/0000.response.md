Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly defines the function `func_1` which implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets under the given constraints.
2. The function uses a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the lowest priced tickets available each day, ensuring that tickets are purchased in the most cost-effective manner.
3. The logic within the function correctly handles the price increase mechanism after purchasing tickets on any given day.
4. The program iterates through each test case, calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the results, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
