Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`.
   - `tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`.
   - `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped.
   - `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`.
   - `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `tickets_bought` is already updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`, we need to ensure that this updated value is still less than `k` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `tickets_bought` to ensure it is less than `k`.

**State:**
State: **`price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`, and `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`**.
