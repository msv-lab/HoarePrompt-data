Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and now `price` is increased by `price_increase`.**

Explanation: The code `price += price_increase` increases the value of `price` by `price_increase`. All other variables (`total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy`, and `price_increase`) remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
