Output State: **All tickets have been bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the cost of buying `k` tickets considering the price increase for each purchase, `price_increase` is the cumulative increase in price for all purchases, and `pq` is an empty list.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all `k` tickets have been bought. The `total_cost` reflects the cumulative cost of these tickets, taking into account the price increase for each purchase. The `price_increase` variable keeps track of the total increase in price over all purchases. Finally, since all tickets have been bought, the priority queue `pq` will be empty as it no longer contains any tuples related to unsold tickets.
