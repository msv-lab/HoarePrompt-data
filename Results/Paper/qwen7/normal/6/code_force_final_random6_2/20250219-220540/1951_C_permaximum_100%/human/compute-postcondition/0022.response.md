Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `price` is increased by `price_increase`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tickets_to_buy` to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. This does not affect the values of `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, or `price` directly, but it changes the value of `tickets_to_buy`. Therefore, the updated state includes this new value for `tickets_to_buy`.
