Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total_cost` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the initial values of `pq`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `pq` is still a heap.
