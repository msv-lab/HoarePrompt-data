Output State: **`tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` is the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`, `day` is the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.**

Explanation: The code `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` pops the tuple with the smallest price from the priority queue `pq` and assigns the price to `price` and the corresponding index to `day`. The state of `tickets_bought` and `total_cost` remains unchanged as no transactions have occurred yet. The `pq` list is updated to exclude the tuple that was just popped.
