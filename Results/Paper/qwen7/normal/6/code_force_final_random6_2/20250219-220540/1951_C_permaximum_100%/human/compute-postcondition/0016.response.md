Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy`. The value of `tickets_to_buy` remains the same as its initial state, which is defined as the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. No other variables are affected.
