Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. According to the problem description, the key factor in determining the winner is whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, the program's logic is flawed.

The program checks if `a + b` is even using `(a + b & 1 == 0)`. This condition is used to determine the winner, but it does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for the game.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Specifically:
- If the number of coins in Alice's wallet (`a`) is even, and the number of coins in Bob's wallet (`b`) is odd, then Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and reducing her own wallet to an odd number of coins.
- Otherwise, Bob will win.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

```

This corrected program checks the parity of `a` and `b` and determines the winner based on the optimal strategy described above. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
