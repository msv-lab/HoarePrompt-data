### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not swap wallets but must always remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to win.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is even, the total number of coins is even.
     - In such a scenario, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an odd number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be forced to have 0 coins in their wallet first, leading to a loss.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the total number of coins is odd.
     - Here, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an even number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that she does not lose until the very end, allowing her to win.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given program correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - The program matches the optimal strategy analysis provided in the problem description.
