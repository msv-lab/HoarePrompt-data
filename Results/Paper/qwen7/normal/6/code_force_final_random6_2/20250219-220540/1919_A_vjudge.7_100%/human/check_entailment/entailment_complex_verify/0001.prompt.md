You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` equal to `test - 1`. The values of `a` and `b` are the last two integers input by the user during the loop's final iteration. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the output was 'Bob' for each iteration where the sum was even; otherwise, the output was 'Alice' for each iteration where the sum was odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of non-negative integers (a and b) within the range of 1 to 10^9, checks if their sum is even or odd, and prints 'Bob' for each pair with an even sum and 'Alice' for each pair with an odd sum. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not swap wallets but must always remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to win.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is even, the total number of coins is even.
     - In such a scenario, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an odd number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be forced to have 0 coins in their wallet first, leading to a loss.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the total number of coins is odd.
     - Here, the player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a position where they have an even number of coins.
     - This means that the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that she does not lose until the very end, allowing her to win.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given program correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - The program matches the optimal strategy analysis provided in the problem description.
