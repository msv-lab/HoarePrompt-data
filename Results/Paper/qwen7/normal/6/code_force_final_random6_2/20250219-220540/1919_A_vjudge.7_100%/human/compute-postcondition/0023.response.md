Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of non-negative integers (a and b) within the range of 1 to 10^9, checks if their sum is even or odd, and prints 'Bob' for each pair with an even sum and 'Alice' for each pair with an odd sum. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes without returning any value.**
