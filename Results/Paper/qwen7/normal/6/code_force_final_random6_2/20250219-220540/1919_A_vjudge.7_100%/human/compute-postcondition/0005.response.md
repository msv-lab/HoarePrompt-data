Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an integer input from the user.
- `b` is an integer input from the user.
- `test` must be at least 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'` to the console. Since no variables are being referenced in the print statement, the output will be the literal string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
