Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, the logic for splitting and inserting the digits is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits, and it does not account for the possibility of creating new numbers that might be out of order.

2. **Function `func_1` Redundancy**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but it is not necessary for determining if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations. This function should be removed or modified to fit the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Inserting Digits**: The current logic for splitting and inserting digits is not implemented correctly. It simply divides the number by 10 and takes the remainder, which does not achieve the desired effect of splitting the digits and reinserting them.

4. **No Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operations do not help in sorting the array.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting and reinserting digits. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits and insert them back
    def split_and_insert(lst, index):
        num = lst[index]
        if num >= 10:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            lst.pop(index)
            for digit in reversed(digits):
                lst.insert(index, digit)
    
    # Apply the operation until the array is sorted or no more operations can be applied
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(list1)):
            if list1[i] >= 10:
                split_and_insert(list1, i)
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            print('No')
            break
```

This corrected program correctly implements the required operations and checks if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the digit splitting and reinserting operation.
