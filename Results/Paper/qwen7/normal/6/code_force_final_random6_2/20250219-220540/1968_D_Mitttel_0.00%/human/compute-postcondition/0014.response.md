Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 16, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `PB` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `PS` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `index` is increased by 8 initially, and then the code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` increases `index` by `n`. So, `index` is increased by 8 + `n`, which is 16.
- The value of `p` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a new list `a` by converting elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. Therefore, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`.
