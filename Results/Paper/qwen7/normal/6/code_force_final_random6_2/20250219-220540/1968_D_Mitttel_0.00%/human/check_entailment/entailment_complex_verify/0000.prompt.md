You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

The `remaining_steps` will be the remainder of `k - steps` when divided by `cycle_length`. `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. `remainder_steps` will be reduced by the total number of iterations minus one. The `score` will be the initial score plus the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score`, plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration of the loop. Finally, `current_pos` will be updated according to the rule `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `calculate_score` accepts a starting position `start_pos` and calculates a score based on the given permutation `p` and array `a`. It first traverses the permutation starting from `start_pos`, accumulating a score by summing the values in the array at the current positions. If a cycle is detected during this traversal, it adjusts the score by considering the sum of the cycle and the number of times the cycle repeats within the given duration `k`. The function ultimately returns the calculated score.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function only considers the direct path from the starting position without accounting for the possibility of moving to the position indicated by the permutation value. This means that the function does not fully simulate the game rules where players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation value.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  Draw
  ```

In this example, let's walk through the game for both players:

**Bodya:**
- Start at position 3.
- First turn: Score = 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5, stays at position 3.
- Second turn: Score = 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10, stays at position 3.
- Final score: 10.

**Sasha:**
- Start at position 2.
- First turn: Score = 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2, moves to position 1.
- Second turn: Score = 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9, stays at position 1.
- Final score: 9.

Since Bodya has a final score of 10 and Sasha has a final score of 9, Bodya should win. However, the program incorrectly returns "Draw" because it does not properly account for the possibility of moving to the position indicated by the permutation value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
