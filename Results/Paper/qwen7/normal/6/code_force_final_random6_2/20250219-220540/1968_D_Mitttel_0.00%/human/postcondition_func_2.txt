The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by parameters \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( PB \), \( PS \), \( p \), and \( a \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each call to `func_1`.
