Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`**.

In more detail:
- `t` is a positive integer that was decremented by 1.
- `n` is now assigned the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer.
- The values of `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous states.
- `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n`.
- `results` now contains one additional element, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
