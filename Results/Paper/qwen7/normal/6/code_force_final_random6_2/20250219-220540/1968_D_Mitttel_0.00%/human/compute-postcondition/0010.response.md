Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`**.

In this case, the code assigns the value of `data[index + 3]` to the variable `PS`. Since `data[index + 3]` is an integer, `PS` is also an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `PB` remain unchanged from their initial states.
