Output State: **`remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_steps = k - steps` assigns the value of `k - steps` to the variable `remaining_steps`. The values of `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` are not affected by this assignment, so they remain the same as their initial states.
