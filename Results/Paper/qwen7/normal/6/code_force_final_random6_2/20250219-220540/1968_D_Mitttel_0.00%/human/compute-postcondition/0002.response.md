Output State: **`index` is 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The line `index = 0` initializes the variable `index` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
