Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 16, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of the function `func_1` to the list `results`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The `index` is increased by 16 initially and then by `n` after the lists `p` and `a` are defined. The `results` list now contains one more element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
