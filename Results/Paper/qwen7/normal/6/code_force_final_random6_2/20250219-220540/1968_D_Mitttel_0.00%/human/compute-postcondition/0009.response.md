Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`**

The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to the variable `PB` as an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
