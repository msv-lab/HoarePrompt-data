Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 16, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is its original value plus `n`.
