Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    PB = int(data[index + 2])
    PS = int(data[index + 3])
    index += 4
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 16, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]` and is updated, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is updated to a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 26`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 3]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`, `index` is increased by 4, `index` is increased by `n`, `a` is updated to a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
