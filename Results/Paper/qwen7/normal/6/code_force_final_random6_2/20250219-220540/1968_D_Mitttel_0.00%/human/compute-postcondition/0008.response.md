Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `k` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
