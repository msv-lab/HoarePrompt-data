Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `remainder_steps`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute for each value from 0 to `remainder_steps - 1`. Therefore, the loop will run `remainder_steps` times.

3. **Adjust the relevant states**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. It is used as an iterator.
   - The variable `remainder_steps` determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop runs `remainder_steps` times, `remainder_steps` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the other given states**:
   - `full_cycles`: This is derived from `remaining_steps // cycle_length`.
   - `remaining_steps`: This is derived from `k - steps`.
   - `cycle_score`: This remains unchanged.
   - `cycle_pos`: This remains unchanged.
   - `score`: This is updated inside the loop but its initial state is given as `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `remainder_steps`, which must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`**
