Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` when divided by `cycle_length` and assigns it to `remainder_steps`. The other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_score`, and `cycle_pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
