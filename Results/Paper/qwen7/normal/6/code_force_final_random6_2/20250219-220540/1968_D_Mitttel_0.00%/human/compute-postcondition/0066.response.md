Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the range function, which uses `remainder_steps`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `remainder_steps`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`.
   - `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.
   - `cycle_score` remains unchanged.
   - `cycle_pos` remains unchanged.
   - `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 1`.
   - `score` is `4 * score`.
   - `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop will execute again if `remainder_steps` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 1`.

5. **Calculate the new value of `remainder_steps`**:
   - For the next iteration, `remainder_steps` should be `remainder_steps - 1`.

6. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `full_cycles` remains unchanged.
   - `remaining_steps` remains unchanged.
   - `cycle_score` remains unchanged.
   - `cycle_pos` remains unchanged.
   - `remainder_steps` becomes `remainder_steps - 1`.
   - `score` remains `4 * score`.
   - `current_pos` remains updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 2`, `score` is `4 * score`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**
