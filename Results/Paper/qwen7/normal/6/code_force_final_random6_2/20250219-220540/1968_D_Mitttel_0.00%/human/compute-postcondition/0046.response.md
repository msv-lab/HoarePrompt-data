Based on the initial state provided:

- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.
- `results` must still contain at least one element.

When the `print(result)` statement is executed, it will print the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains at least one element and `result` is defined as the next element in the list, it implies that `result` is the first element of the `results` list.

Output: **the first element in the results list**
