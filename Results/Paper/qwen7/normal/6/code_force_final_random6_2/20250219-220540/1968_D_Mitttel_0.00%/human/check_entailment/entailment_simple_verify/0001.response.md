### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the code based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code.

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - This function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic is straightforward and correct.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**
   - This function simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It handles cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation when a cycle is detected.
   - The cycle detection and handling logic is correct. The function correctly calculates the score by considering both the initial path and the cycles.

3. **Function `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the entire input into a string, splits it, and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case.
   - The handling of input and output is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Cycle Detection and Handling**
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles and handles them efficiently.
   - The cycle length and score calculations are accurate.
   - The remaining steps are correctly accounted for, ensuring that the total score is computed correctly.

2. **Game Simulation**
   - The game simulation in `calculate_score` correctly follows the rules of the game.
   - The score is incremented appropriately at each step, and the position updates correctly based on the permutation.

3. **Input Processing**
   - The `func_2` function reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - The input is split and processed in a way that ensures all necessary data is available for each test case.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotated version of the code, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. The functions handle the game simulation, cycle detection, and input processing accurately.
