Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to the value of `int(data[index + 1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
