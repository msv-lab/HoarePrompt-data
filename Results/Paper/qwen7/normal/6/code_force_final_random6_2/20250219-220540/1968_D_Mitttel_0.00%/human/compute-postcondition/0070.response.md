Output State: `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - (remainder_steps % cycle_length)`, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1] for each iteration`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `full_cycles` will still be the quotient of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length`. The `remaining_steps` will be the remainder of `k - steps` when divided by `cycle_length`. `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. `remainder_steps` will be reduced by the total number of iterations minus one. The `score` will be the initial score plus the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score`, plus the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration of the loop. Finally, `current_pos` will be updated according to the rule `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration.
