Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `PB` to the integer from `data[index + 2]`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
