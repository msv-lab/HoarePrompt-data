Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 2`, `score` is `4 * score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `current_pos` to `p[current_pos - 1]`. This means that the value of `current_pos` changes to the value stored in the list `p` at the index `current_pos - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
