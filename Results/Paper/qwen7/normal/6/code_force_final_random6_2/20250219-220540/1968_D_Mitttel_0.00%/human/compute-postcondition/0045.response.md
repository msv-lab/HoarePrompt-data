Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `results` list. Once all elements are processed, the loop will terminate.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is one of the elements in the `results` list.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. After processing one element from `results`, the next `result` will be the next element in the list.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that `result` is now the next element in the `results` list, and `results` should still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration would be:

**State:**
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.
- `results` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final answer is:
```
State: **result is the next element in the results list, results must still contain at least one element**
```
