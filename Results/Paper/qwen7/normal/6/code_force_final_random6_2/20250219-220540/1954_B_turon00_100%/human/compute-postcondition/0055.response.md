Output State: **`cnt` is either 2 or 1, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 0, it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
