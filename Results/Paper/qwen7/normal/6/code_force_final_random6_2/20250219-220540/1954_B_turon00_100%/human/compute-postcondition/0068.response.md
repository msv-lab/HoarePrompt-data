Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is 0, `t` is `initial_t - n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, and `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` resets to 0 after the loop.
- `n` becomes 0 because the loop runs `n` times, decrementing `n` each time until it reaches 0.
- `t` is updated to `initial_t - n`, where `initial_t` is the original value of `t` before the loop started.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `tmp` remains `a[0]` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `ans` holds the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a` after the loop.
- `i` is set to `n-1` after the last iteration of the loop.
