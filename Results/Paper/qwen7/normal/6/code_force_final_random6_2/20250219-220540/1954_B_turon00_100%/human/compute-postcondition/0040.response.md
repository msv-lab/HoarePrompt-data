Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `ans`, `cnt`, `n`, and `t` are updated as described, but no further changes are made to these variables within the given code snippet.
