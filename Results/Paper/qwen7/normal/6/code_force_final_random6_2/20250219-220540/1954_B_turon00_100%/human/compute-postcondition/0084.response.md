Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, and `cnt` is equal to `cnt` + 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `i` is less than `n` and `tmp` has some value before the execution of the code, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `cnt` is now one more than its previous value.
