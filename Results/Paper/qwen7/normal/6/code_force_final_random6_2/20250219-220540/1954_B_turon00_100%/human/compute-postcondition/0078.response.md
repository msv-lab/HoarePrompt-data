Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `initial_t - n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is now `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = a[0]` simply assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
