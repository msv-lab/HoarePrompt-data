Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition. Instead, it attempts to find the longest subarray of consecutive identical elements and outputs the size of this subarray if the array has more than one unique element. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct answer is `1` because removing the second element (index 1) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful. The program fails to consider this scenario and similar cases where removing a single element can break the beauty condition.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful or cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. For instance, the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```
The program incorrectly outputs `-1` instead of `0` because the array is already beautiful and no elements need to be removed.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
