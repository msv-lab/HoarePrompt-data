Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `initial_t - n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is now `a[0]`**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, `ans`, `i`, and the updated `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
