Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. However, since the initial values of `ans` and `cnt` are not provided, the only information we can definitively state is that `ans` has been updated. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
