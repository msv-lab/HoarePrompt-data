Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the integer `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it is guaranteed to be a positive integer, but we need to ensure it is not zero.

3. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `t`. It must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
