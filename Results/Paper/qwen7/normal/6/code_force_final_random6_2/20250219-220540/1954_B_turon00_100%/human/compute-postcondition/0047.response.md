Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
