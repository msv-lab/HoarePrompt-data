Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `tmp` has some value
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`
   - `n` remains the same
   - `tmp` remains the same
   - `cnt` and `ans` remain the same since they are not directly affected by the increment of `i` in this context.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`, `i` is incremented by 1**
