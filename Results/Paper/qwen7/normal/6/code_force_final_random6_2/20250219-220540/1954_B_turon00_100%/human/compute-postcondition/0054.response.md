Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and greater than 0.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
   - `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of `n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `cnt` remains either 1 or 0.
   - `n` remains an input integer and greater than 0.
   - `t` is still decreased by 1.
   - `a` is still a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `tmp` is still equal to `a[0]`.
   - `ans` is still equal to `min(ans, cnt)`.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 0, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `i` is 1**
