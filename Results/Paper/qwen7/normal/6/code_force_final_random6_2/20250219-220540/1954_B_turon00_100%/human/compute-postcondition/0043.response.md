Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `n`**.

This means that the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
