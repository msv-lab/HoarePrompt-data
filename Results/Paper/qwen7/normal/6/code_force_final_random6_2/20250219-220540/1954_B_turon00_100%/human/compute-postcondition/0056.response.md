Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 0, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `ans` will remain unchanged because both 1 and 0 are less than or equal to themselves. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.
