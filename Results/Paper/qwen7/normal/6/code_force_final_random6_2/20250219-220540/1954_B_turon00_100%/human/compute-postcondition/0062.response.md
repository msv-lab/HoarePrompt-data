Output State: **`cnt` is either 2, 1, or 0; `n` is an input integer and greater than 0; `i` is either 2 or 3; `t` is decreased by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` can only be 2, 1, or 0, and `ans` is initially set to be at least one of these values (as it is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`), the value of `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected by this line of code.
