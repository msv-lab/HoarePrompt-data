Postcondition: **`a` is a new input string with a length greater than 6, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is either 8 or 10, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 7 and having a length of 3. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 10 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 8.**
