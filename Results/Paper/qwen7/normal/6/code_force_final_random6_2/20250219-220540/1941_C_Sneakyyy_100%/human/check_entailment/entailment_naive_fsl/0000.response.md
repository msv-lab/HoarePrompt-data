Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only checks for substrings of length 3 ("map" or "pie") and does not account for other occurrences of "pie" or "map" within the string. For example, in the string "ppiee", the program would not correctly identify that removing 2 characters ("pie") is sufficient to make the string beautiful. The program should check for all occurrences of "pie" and "map" and remove them, not just those that start at index 0 and extend 3 characters forward.
