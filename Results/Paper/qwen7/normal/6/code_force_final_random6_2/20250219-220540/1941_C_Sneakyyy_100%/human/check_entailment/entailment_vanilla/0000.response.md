Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the length `n` of the string `a` and the string itself.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of characters to be removed.
   - `i` is initialized to 0, which is used as an index to traverse the string.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - A while loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. This ensures that we do not go out of bounds when checking substrings of length 3.
   - Inside the loop, a substring `s` of length 3 starting at index `i` is extracted.
   - If `s` is either "map" or "pie", it means the substring is one of the unwanted substrings. In this case, `i` is incremented by 3 (to skip the next three characters) and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s` is neither "map" nor "pie", `i` is simply incremented by 1 to move to the next character.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing the entire string, the value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Edge Cases and Validation:
- The program correctly handles the edge case where the string might end before reaching the condition `i < len(a) - 2`.
- The logic correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters to eliminate "map" and "pie" substrings.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful according to the given rules. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
