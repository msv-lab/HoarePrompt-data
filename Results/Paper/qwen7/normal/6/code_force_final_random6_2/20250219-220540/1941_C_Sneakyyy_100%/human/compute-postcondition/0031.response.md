Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the original string input by the user.
- `n` is the original input integer.
- `ans` is the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
- `i` is the final index value after the loop has completed its iterations, which will be `len(a) - 2` if the loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` is no longer satisfied.
- `s` is the last substring of `a` considered during the loop, starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, but it does not affect the final state of `ans`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the total count of occurrences where the substring 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
