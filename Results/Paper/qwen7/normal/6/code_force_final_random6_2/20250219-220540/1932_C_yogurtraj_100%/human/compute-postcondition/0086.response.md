Output State: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is `q2 + 1`**

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `q2` and retains the original values of `i` and `k`.
