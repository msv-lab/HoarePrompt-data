Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order, decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`.
   - `k` is updated as per the given condition.
   - `y[i]` is equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `n - 3`.
   - If `i` was `n - 3` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `n - 4`.

5. **Update the necessary states**:
   - `i` will be decreased by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `y` and `k` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`, `k` is updated as per the given condition, `y[i]` is equal to `k`**.

However, to clearly specify the exact value of `i` for the next iteration, we consider both possibilities:

- If `i` was `n - 2` previously, then `i` is now `n - 3`.
- If `i` was `n - 3` previously, then `i` is now `n - 4`.

Thus, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`i` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`, `k` is updated as per the given condition, `y[i]` is equal to `k`**.
