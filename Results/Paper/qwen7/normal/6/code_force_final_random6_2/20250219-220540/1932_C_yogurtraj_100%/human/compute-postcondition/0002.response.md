Output State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `ii`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
