Output State: **`i` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`, `k` is updated as per the given condition, `y[i]` is equal to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
