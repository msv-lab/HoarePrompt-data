Postcondition: `i` is -1, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` (if `t[-1] == 'L'`) or `a[l] % m` (otherwise), `y` is a list where all elements are 0 except for the last one, which is equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `m` is an input integer, `t` is the string input by the user, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `q1` is either `l - 2` (if `t[-1] == 'L'`) or `l - 1` (otherwise), `q2` is either `l` (if `t[-1] == 'L'`) or `l + 1` (otherwise).
