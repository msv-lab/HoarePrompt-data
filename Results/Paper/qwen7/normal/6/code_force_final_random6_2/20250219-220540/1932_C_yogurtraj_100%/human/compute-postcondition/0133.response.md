Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates from `n-2` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `n-2` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `-1`
   - `n` is `2`
   - `y[i]` is `k`
   - `q1` is 1 if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q1` is 0
   - `q2` is unchanged

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `-1`, the loop will stop because the loop condition `i >= n-2` (which is `i >= 0`) is no longer satisfied.
   - Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` or `n` for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, the states of `i` and `n` remain the same.
   - `y[i]` remains `k` (since `i` is still `-1`).
   - `q1` remains unchanged based on the condition `t[i] == 'R'`.
   - `q2` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `-1`, `n` is `2`, `y[i]` is `k`, `q1` is 1 if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q1` is 0, and `q2` is unchanged**.
