Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `n` is `2`, `q1` is either `1` if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q1` is `0`, `q2` is `1` if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q2` is `0`, `y[i]` is `k`, `y[i]` is `k * a[1] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `y[i]` is `k * a[0] % m`**.

Explanation: The code `y[i] = k` assigns the value of `k` to `y[i]`. Since `i` is `-1`, the value of `y[i]` becomes `k`. Additionally, since `q2` is incremented by 1 only if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, and `i` is `-1`, `q2` remains `0` unless `t[-1] == 'R'`, which is false. Therefore, `q2` is `0`. The value of `q1` remains unchanged as there is no condition to change it in this code snippet.
