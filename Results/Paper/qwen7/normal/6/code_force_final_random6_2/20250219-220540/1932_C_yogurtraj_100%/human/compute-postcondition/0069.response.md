Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `y[-1]` is equal to `k`, `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to `k * a[q2] % m`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
