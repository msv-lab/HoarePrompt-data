Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `y[-1]` is `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to either `a[l - 2] * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `a[l - 1] * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, the element at index `i` of `y` is `k`, and the character at index `i` of `t` is either 'R' or not 'R'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to either `a[l - 2] * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `a[l - 1] * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, the element at index `-1` of `y` is `k`, and `y[ii]` is set to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to either `a[l - 2] * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `a[l - 1] * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, the element at index `-1` of `y` is `k`, and `y[n - 3]` is set to `k`. `y[ii]` is now equal to `k` depending on the value of `ii` (which is 0), and `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the last character of `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
