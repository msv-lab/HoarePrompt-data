Output State: `i` is `-1`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` where every element is equal to `k`, `k` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `q2` is updated based on the positions of 'R' in the string `t`, and `q1` is updated based on the positions of characters other than 'R'. The loop has executed `n-1` times, updating the value of `k` and assigning it to each corresponding position in the list `y`.

To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1` because the loop starts from `n-2` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. The variable `k` will hold the final computed value after all conditions inside the loop have been evaluated for each index from `n-2` down to `0`. The list `y` will contain `k` repeated `n` times since `y[i]` is set to `k` for each iteration of the loop. Variables `q1` and `q2` will reflect their final states after the last iteration based on the sequence of 'R' and non-'R' characters in the string `t`.
