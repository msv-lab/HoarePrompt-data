Based on the initial state provided:

- The variable `i` will be `-1` after the loop has executed all its iterations.
- The variable `k` will be the final value after all the multiplications and mod operations have been performed based on the conditions inside the loop.
- The list `y` will have its last element `y[-1]` equal to the final value of `k`, and all other elements of `y` will still be `0`.

Given this information, the list `y` will look like this: `[0, 0, ..., 0, k]` where `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop has executed.

Therefore, when the `print(*y)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces.

Output: **0 0 ... 0 k** (where `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop)
