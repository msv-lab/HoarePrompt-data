Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 2, 3, or `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is either 10, 11, 9, 12, 13, or 11 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, `k` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1. The exact value of `sunks` depends on its previous value and the condition related to `k` and `2 * a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
