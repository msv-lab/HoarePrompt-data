You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n). It iterates through the list `a` and performs operations based on the value of `k`, counting the number of valid operations. The function returns the total count of these valid operations, denoted as `sunks`, which can range from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` which is supposed to calculate the number of ships sunk. This function should handle the logic of attacking the ships according to the specified pattern.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - The loop checks if `k` is zero, breaking early if there are no more attacks to perform.
   - If `l` and `r` are at the same position, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the ship at that position.
   - If the durability of the leftmost ship is less than or equal to the rightmost ship, it performs the necessary attacks and updates the durability and count of sunk ships.
   - If the durability of the rightmost ship is less than the leftmost ship, it performs similar operations but on the rightmost ship.
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the durability of the ship is exactly equal to the remaining attacks (`a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`).
   - It also handles the case where both ships have the same durability and the remaining attacks are exactly twice the durability (`a[l] * 2 == k`).

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
