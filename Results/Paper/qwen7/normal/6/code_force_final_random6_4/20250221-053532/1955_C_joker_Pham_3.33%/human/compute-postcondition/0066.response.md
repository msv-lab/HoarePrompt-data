The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 3`, and `sunks` is 4.**
