Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Initially, `sunks` was 3, so after executing this line, `sunks` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
