Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), if `a[r]` is not zero, `sunks` is either 8, 9, or 7 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1; if `a[r]` is zero, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
