    #State: The loop will terminate when `l > r` or `k == 0`. At this point, `l` will be greater than `r`, indicating that all possible operations within the loop have been exhausted. The value of `sunks` will be the total number of valid operations performed, which could range from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of `k`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of valid operations performed, denoted as 'sunks', which ranges from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of 'k'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n). It iterates through the list `a` and performs operations based on the value of `k`, counting the number of valid operations. The function returns the total count of these valid operations, denoted as `sunks`, which can range from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of `k`.
