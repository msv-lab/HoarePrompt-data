Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. The current value of `l` is equal to `r`, and the current value of `k` is `k - a[l] * 2`. The condition `k >= a[l] * 2` is now false.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`. Since `l` is equal to `r`, and `r` is `n - 1`, `l` is also `n - 1`. The condition `k >= a[l] * 2` is no longer true because `k` was initially at least `a[l] * 2` and has now been reduced by `a[l] * 2`.
