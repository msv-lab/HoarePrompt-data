Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1 or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is equal to 6, `a[l]` is decreased by \(2 \times a[r]\), `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[r]\), `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`, and `a[l]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[r]\).
- `a[l]` is decreased by \(2 \times a[r]\).
