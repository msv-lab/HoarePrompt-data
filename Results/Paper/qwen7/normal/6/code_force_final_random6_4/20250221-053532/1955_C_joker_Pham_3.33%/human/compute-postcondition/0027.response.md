Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 2; `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
