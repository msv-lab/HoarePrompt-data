Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` which is supposed to calculate the number of ships sunk. This function should handle the logic of attacking the ships according to the specified pattern.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - The loop checks if `k` is zero, breaking early if there are no more attacks to perform.
   - If `l` and `r` are at the same position, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the ship at that position.
   - If the durability of the leftmost ship is less than or equal to the rightmost ship, it performs the necessary attacks and updates the durability and count of sunk ships.
   - If the durability of the rightmost ship is less than the leftmost ship, it performs similar operations but on the rightmost ship.
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the durability of the ship is exactly equal to the remaining attacks (`a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`).
   - It also handles the case where both ships have the same durability and the remaining attacks are exactly twice the durability (`a[l] * 2 == k`).

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
