Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `sunks` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`.

This means that after executing the if-else block, regardless of the value of `k`, `l` is set to 1 and `r` is set to `n - 2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is set to either 3 or 4. If `k` is 0, `sunks` is set to 3; otherwise, it is set to 4 if `k` is at least `2 * a[r]`, or remains 3 otherwise.
