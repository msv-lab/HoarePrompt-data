Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `sunks` is either 3 or 4. Additionally, after executing the if-else block, `k` is either equal to twice the value of `a[r]` minus one, or it is not equal to twice the value of `a[r]` minus one, and in both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
