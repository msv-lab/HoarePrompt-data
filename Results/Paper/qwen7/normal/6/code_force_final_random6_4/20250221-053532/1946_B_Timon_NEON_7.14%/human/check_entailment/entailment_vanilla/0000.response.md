### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The operations can be performed on any subarray, including the empty subarray, which adds zero to the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Adding zeros through empty subarrays does not change the sum.
   - Adding the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the sum.
   - The optimal strategy often involves adding the sum of the entire array multiple times.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used correctly in the main logic.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, its implementation seems overly complex and may not be necessary for the problem.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

4. **Simplified Solution**:
   - The key insight is to add the sum of the entire array `k` times. This is because adding the sum of the entire array multiple times will always yield the highest possible sum.
   - The maximum sum after `k` operations is essentially the sum of the array multiplied by `k`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Implementation**:
   - Calculate the sum of the array.
   - Multiply the sum by `k`.
   - Take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The given code does not implement the optimal solution. Specifically, `func_2` is unnecessary and `func_3` is incomplete. A correct implementation would directly compute the sum of the array and apply the transformation as described.

**Correctness: False**
