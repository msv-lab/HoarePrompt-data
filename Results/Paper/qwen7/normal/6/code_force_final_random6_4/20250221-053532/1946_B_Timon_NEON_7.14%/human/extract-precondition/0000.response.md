Precondition: **number is an integer, and quantity is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5.** 

Note: The provided function `func_3` seems incomplete and does not fully align with the problem description. However, based on the variables in the function signature, the precondition is as stated above.
