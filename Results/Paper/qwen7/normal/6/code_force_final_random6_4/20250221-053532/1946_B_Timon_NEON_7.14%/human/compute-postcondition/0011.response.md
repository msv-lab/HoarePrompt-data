Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment', 'i - 1'], `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is now ['new_segment[0]', 'new_segment[1]'], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` has at least one element, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, and the first segment (`max_segment[0]`) is not greater than the first segment of `new_segment (`new_segment[0]`).**

Explanation: The code assigns `new_segment` to `max_segment`. This means that `max_segment` now holds the same values as `new_segment`, which are `['new_segment[0]', 'new_segment[1]']`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
