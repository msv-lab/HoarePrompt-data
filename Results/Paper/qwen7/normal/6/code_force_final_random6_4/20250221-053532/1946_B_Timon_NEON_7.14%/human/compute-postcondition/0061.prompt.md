Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `segments_variants` is either a list containing ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment` and `arr[i] < 0`, or an empty list if `arr[i] >= 0`. `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, and a non-empty list with its first element as `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` has at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i - 1]` or an empty list, `new_segment` is either `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or `new_segment + [i_new - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i_new]` in both cases, or `segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or an empty list, `new_segment` is either `[arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i_new]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
