Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] if the first element of `max_segment` is not greater than the first element of `new_segment`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]`; `max_sum` remains -1; `arr` has at least one element, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code increments the first element of `max_segment` by `arr[i]`. Since `arr[i]` is less than 0, the first element of `max_segment` decreases. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
