Output State: **`segments_variants` now includes the current `max_segment` plus the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`); `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far; `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated.**

Explanation: The code appends the current `max_segment` (which contains the sum and the end index of the segment with the highest sum found so far) plus the length of the array (`len(arr) - 1`) to the `segments_variants` list. The `new_segment` list remains empty as it is reset when a new segment with a higher sum is found, but no such segment was found here. The `max_segment` and `max_sum` variables remain unchanged as they were not updated in this particular line of code.
