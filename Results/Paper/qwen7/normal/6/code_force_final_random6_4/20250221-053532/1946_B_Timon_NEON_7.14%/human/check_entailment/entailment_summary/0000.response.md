Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution uses two main functions: `func_2` to find the segment with the highest sum and `func_1` to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly identifies the segment with the highest sum in the array. It handles both positive and negative segments appropriately.
   - The logic is sound and ensures that the segment with the highest sum is identified, even if it includes negative numbers.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The implementation is straightforward and correct.

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum using the segment with the highest sum (`max_segment`) and applies the formula: 
     \[
     \text{answer} = \text{max\_segment[0]} \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - \text{max\_segment[0]}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the fact that we can insert the sum of the segment multiple times (up to `k` times), and it adjusts the overall sum accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the segment sum might be zero or negative correctly.
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
