### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). While it is used in the example output, it is not directly relevant to solving the main problem. However, it is part of the solution as it is used to compute the final result.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. It uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the current segment and updates the maximum segment found so far.
   - The function does not handle the insertion of sums of subarrays. Instead, it only finds the maximum sum subarray and returns its indices. This is a critical flaw since the problem requires inserting the sum of subarrays, not just finding the maximum subarray.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not provide any functionality related to the problem. It is supposed to repeat a number `quantity` times, but it is not implemented correctly and does not contribute to solving the main problem.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program should involve repeatedly selecting subarrays, computing their sums, and inserting these sums back into the array. The function `func_2` alone cannot achieve this as it only finds the maximum subarray.
   - To maximize the sum, we need to consider how to use the `k` operations effectively. One optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the entire array, as this will increase the overall sum significantly.

6. **Correctness of the Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions do not handle the core requirement of inserting sums of subarrays `k` times.
   - The assessment also correctly points out that `func_2` only finds the maximum subarray and does not insert sums.
   - The assessment is accurate in stating that `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to perform the `k` operations of inserting sums of subarrays into the array.
