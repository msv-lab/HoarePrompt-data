Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(arr))`.

2. **Determine the Relevant Variables**: The relevant variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(arr)`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.

4. **Analyze the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `segments_variants`: Either a list containing `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment` and `arr[i] < 0`, or an empty list if `arr[i] >= 0`.
   - `new_segment`: An empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, and a non-empty list with its first element as `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`.
   - `max_segment`: Updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`.
   - `max_sum`: Remains `-1`.
   - `arr`: Has at least one element.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `len(arr)`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - `len(arr)` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of the array, which does not change within the loop.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `segments_variants`: The state of `segments_variants` does not directly depend on `i`, so it remains the same.
   - `new_segment`: The state of `new_segment` does not directly depend on `i`, so it remains the same.
   - `max_segment`: The state of `max_segment` does not directly depend on `i`, so it remains the same.
   - `max_sum`: Remains `-1`.
   - `arr`: Remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment` and `arr[i] < 0`, or an empty list if `arr[i] >= 0`. `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, and a non-empty list with its first element as `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` has at least one element. `i` is incremented by 1.**
