Output State: **`segments_variants` must include at least one element (the new variant), `segment` is the new variant, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Since `segment` is the new variant, `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as `segment`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
