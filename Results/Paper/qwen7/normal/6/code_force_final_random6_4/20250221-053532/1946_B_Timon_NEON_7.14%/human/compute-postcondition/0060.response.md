Output State: `segments_variants` is a list of all valid segments found during the loop execution, where each segment is represented as a list containing the sum of elements in the segment and the end index of the segment. `new_segment` is an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new valid segment is added to `segments_variants`. `max_segment` contains the sum of the best segment found and its end index. `max_sum` remains -1 since it is not used in the loop logic to update any value. The exact contents of `segments_variants` and `max_segment` depend on the input array `arr`.

In more detail, `segments_variants` will contain all segments that meet the criteria of having a sum greater than or equal to `max_segment[0]` and ending at the last index processed. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum among those that meet the criteria.
