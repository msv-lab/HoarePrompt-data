Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(arr)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `segments_variants`: Since the loop hasn't run yet for this new value of `i`, it will be either a list containing `max_segment + [i - 1]` or an empty list.
   - `new_segment`: Similarly, since the loop hasn't run yet for this new value of `i`, it will be either `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`.
   - `max_segment`: It will be updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i] < 0`.
   - `max_sum`: It remains `-1` as no changes are made to it in the loop head.
   - `i`: It is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

Now, let's put this into the required format:

**State:**
- `segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or an empty list.
- `new_segment` is either `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i_new] < 0`.
- `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`.
- `max_sum` remains `-1`.
- `i` is `i_new`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or an empty list, `new_segment` is either `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or an empty list if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`.**
