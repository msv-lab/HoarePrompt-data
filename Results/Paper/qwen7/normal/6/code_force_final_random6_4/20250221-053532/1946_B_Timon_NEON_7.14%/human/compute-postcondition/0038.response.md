Output State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment` and `arr[i] < 0`, or an empty list if `arr[i] >= 0`. `new_segment` is now `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains an empty list if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, and remains `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` has at least one element. `i` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the `new_segment` is now set to `[arr[i], i]` because `arr[i] < 0`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state, except for `i` which is incremented by 1.
