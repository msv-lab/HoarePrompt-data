Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['max_segment + [i - 1]'], `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` has at least one element, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is formed by adding `i - 1` to `max_segment`. Since `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, the new list added to `segments_variants` is `[0, 0, i - 1]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
