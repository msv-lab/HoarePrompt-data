Postcondition: **`segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged, `max_sum` remains -1, and if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.**
