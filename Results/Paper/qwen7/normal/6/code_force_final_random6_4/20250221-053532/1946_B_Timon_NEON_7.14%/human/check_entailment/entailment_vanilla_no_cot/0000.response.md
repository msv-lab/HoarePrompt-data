Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The program contains three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but only `func_1` is used in the solution. The other two functions are not utilized.
- `func_1` correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum sum subarray. It seems to be trying to handle positive and negative segments, but the implementation is flawed.
- `func_3` is completely unused and does not contribute to the solution.

To solve the problem, we need to focus on finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations. The key insight is that adding the sum of any subarray multiple times can significantly increase the array's sum. Here’s a more appropriate approach:

1. Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. If the number of operations `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array `n`, we can add the sum of the entire array `k` times, which gives us the maximum possible sum.
3. Otherwise, we can use the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and adjust the result accordingly.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import *

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_sum = current_sum = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def max_array_sum_after_operations(n, k, arr):
    MOD = 1000000007
    initial_sum = sum(arr)
    
    if k >= n:
        # We can add the sum of the array k times
        return (initial_sum * k) % MOD
    else:
        # Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum
        max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
        return (initial_sum + (k - n) * max_subarray) % MOD

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_array_sum_after_operations(n, k, arr))
```

This code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
