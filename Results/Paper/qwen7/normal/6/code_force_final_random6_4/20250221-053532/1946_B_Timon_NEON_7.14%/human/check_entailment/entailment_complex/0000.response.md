### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution involves finding the segment with the highest sum and using it to maximize the overall sum after \( k \) operations.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). It takes an integer and returns the remainder when divided by \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is essential for handling large sums.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the segment with the highest sum in the array. However, the logic is flawed:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` but does not properly track the start and end indices of segments.
     - It appends the current segment to `segments_variants` even if it is not the best segment found so far.
     - It incorrectly sets `total_max_segment` to `[-1]` if `segments_variants` is empty, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code and seems to be irrelevant to the problem.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Segment Tracking**: The function `func_2` does not correctly track the start and end indices of the segments, leading to incorrect results.
   - **Unnecessary and Incorrect Logic**: The function incorrectly sets `total_max_segment` to `[-1]` under certain conditions, which is not necessary and may lead to incorrect results.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the segment with the highest sum, we should iterate through the array and keep track of the cumulative sum and the maximum sum encountered.
   - We should also handle edge cases where the array might contain negative numbers and ensure the segment with the highest sum is correctly identified.

Given these issues, the provided implementation of `func_2` is incorrect and cannot produce the correct result for the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
