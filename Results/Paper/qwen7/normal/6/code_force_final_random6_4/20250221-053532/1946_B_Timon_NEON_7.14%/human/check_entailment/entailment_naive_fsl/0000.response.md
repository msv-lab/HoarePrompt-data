Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main requirement of performing k operations to maximize the sum of the array. 

- `func_1` simply returns a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is unrelated to the problem.
- `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray but does not incorporate the ability to insert sums of subarrays k times. It also does not handle the case where k operations can be used to create multiple subarrays and insert their sums into the array.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not provide any functionality related to the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
