Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `segments_variants` now includes a new variant which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`); `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far; `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated; `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must include at least one element (the new variant), `segment` is the new variant, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if the first element of `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if the first element of `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`, otherwise `max_segment` remains unchanged, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is unchanged unless the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged, `max_sum` remains -1, and if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
