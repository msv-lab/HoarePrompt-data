Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is the last character of the original string `s` after all iterations, `s` must be a non-empty string (but now it is an empty string since all characters have been added to set `a`), `a` contains all unique characters from the original string `s`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `i` will be the last character processed (though the exact value depends on the order of processing which isn't specified), `s` will be an empty string as all characters have been added to set `a`, and `a` will contain every unique character from the original string `s`.
