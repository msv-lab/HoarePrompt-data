Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character of the original string `s` after all iterations, `s` is an empty string, `a` contains all unique characters from the original string `s`, and `newstr` is the reverse of the original string `s` if the length of set `a` is greater than 1; otherwise, `newstr` is the original string `s`.
