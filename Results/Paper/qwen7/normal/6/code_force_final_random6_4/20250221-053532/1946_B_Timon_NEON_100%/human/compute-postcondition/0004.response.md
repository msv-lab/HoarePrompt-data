Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0, we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(arr)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust Other Variables**: The other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given code snippet. They remain unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `i` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`**.
