Output State: **`new_segment[0]` is updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`, and `max_segment[0]` is updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the value of `new_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. Similarly, `max_segment[0]` is also updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]`. The initial conditions that `new_segment` is not empty and `max_segment[0]` is updated to its previous value plus `arr[i]` remain valid.
