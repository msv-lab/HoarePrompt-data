Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i-1]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of `max_segment` by `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is the length of `arr` - 1, `arr[i]` refers to the last element of the list `arr`. Since `new_segment` and `segments_variants` are only updated when `new_segment` is not an empty list, they remain unchanged as they are empty. `max_sum` remains -1 as it was not affected by the code.
