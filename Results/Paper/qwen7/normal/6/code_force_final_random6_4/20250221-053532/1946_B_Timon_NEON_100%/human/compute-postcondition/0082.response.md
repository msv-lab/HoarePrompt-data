Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `segments_variants` contains at least one segment, and `total_max_segment` is equal to the segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest first element (i.e., the maximum sum of any subsegment), provided that the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, `total_max_segment` remains [-1].**

This means that after the loop completes, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum among all the segments in `segments_variants`, as long as that segment is not just a single element. If there is no valid segment (i.e., all segments are single elements or none satisfy the conditions), `total_max_segment` will still be [-1].
