Postcondition: **`max_sum` remains -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either `[arr[i], i]` or an empty list, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is either a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` or an empty list, and the current value of `i` is the length of `arr` - 1.**
