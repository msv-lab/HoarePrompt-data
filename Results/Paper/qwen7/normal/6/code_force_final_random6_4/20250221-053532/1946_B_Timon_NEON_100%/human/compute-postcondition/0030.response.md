Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr` using `range(len(arr))`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is -1
   - `arr` is a list of integers
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment with its start point increased by `arr[i]`
   - `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i]`
   - `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, or an empty list if `new_segment` is empty
   - `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]` and `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty
   - `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0
   - `segments_variants` remains an empty list if `new_segment` is empty
   - The current value of `i` is equal to the length of `arr`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The length of `arr` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `max_sum` remains `-1` (since it is not affected by the loop itself).
   - `arr` remains the same list of integers.
   - `new_segment` and `max_segment` will depend on the value of `arr[i]` and whether `new_segment` was empty or not in the previous iteration.
   - `segments_variants` will also depend on the value of `arr[i]` and whether `new_segment` was empty or not.
   - The new value of `i` will be the length of `arr`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment with its start point increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]` and `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `segments_variants` remains an empty list if `new_segment` is empty, and the current value of `i` is the length of `arr`**.
