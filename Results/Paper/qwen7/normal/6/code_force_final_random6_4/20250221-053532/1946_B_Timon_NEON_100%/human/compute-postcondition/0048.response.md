Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`, assuming `new_segment` was not empty.**

This means that if `new_segment` was not empty, the list `segments_variants` has been updated by appending a new list to it. The new list is formed by taking `max_segment` and adding `[i - 1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
