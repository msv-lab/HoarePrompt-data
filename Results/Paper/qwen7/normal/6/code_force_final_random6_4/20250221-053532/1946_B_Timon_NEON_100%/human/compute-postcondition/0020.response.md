Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is a segment with its start point increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is [0, 0] with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code increments the start point of `new_segment` by `arr[i]`. Since `i` was 1 before and now it is incremented by 1, `i` is now 2. The value of `arr[i]` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 0. All other variables remain in their original state.
