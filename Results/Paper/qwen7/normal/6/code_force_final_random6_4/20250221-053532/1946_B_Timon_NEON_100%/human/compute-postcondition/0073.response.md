Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment; `total_max_segment` is now equal to the first segment; the length of `segment` is not 1. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1` is true, then `total_max_segment` remains unchanged and the length of `segments_variants` is still at least one.
