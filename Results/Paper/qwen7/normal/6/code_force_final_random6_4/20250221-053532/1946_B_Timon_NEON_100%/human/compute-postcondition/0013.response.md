Output State: **`max_segment` is `new_segment`, `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is not empty, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
