Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains the list `new_segment + [i - 1]`; `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. This means that `max_segment` now holds the same list as `new_segment`, while `segments_variants` remains unchanged from its initial state.
