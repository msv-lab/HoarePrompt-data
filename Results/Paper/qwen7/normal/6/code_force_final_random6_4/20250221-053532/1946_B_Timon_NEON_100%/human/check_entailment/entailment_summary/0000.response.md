Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
2. The solution uses two main functions: `func_2` to find the segment with the maximum sum and `func_1` to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. `func_2` correctly identifies the segment with the highest sum among all possible subsegments, including handling edge cases where the segment might be empty.
4. The formula used in the main loop of the code (`max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`) is correct. This formula leverages the fact that inserting the sum of the best segment k times can significantly increase the array's sum, while subtracting `max_segment[0]` accounts for the double counting of the segment's value.
5. `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given that all parts of the program are consistent with the problem requirements and the execution summaries provided, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
