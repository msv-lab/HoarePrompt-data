Output State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one segment, `total_max_segment` is now equal to the current `segment`.**

Explanation: The code `total_max_segment = segment` assigns the value of the variable `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Since `segment` is part of `segments_variants`, and `total_max_segment` was previously either the first segment of `segments_variants` or remained unchanged from the previous iteration, after executing the code, `total_max_segment` now holds the value of the current `segment`.
