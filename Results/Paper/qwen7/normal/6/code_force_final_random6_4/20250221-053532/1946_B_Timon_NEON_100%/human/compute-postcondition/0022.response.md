Postcondition: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment with its start point increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, and `i` is 2.
