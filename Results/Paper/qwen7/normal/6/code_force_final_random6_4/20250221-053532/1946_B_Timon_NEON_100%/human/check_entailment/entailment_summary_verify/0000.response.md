### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided functions with the given problem description and function summaries.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1`: Returns the input number modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - `func_2`: This function seems to be intended to find the maximum sum of a subarray, but it does not fully capture the logic needed for the problem.
   - `func_3`: This function is not used in the main logic and is incorrectly summarized. It should be ignored for the problem at hand.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum of a subarray, but it does not account for the flexibility of inserting subarray sums at any position.
   - It only considers contiguous subarrays and does not explore the possibility of inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times or at different positions.
   - The function `func_2` is incomplete and does not fully address the problem requirements.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The core issue is that the provided `func_2` does not correctly handle the logic of inserting subarray sums multiple times and at different positions.
   - The problem requires exploring all possible ways to insert subarray sums, which is a complex combinatorial problem.
   - The current implementation is insufficient to solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` is incomplete and does not fully explore the necessary logic to achieve the maximum possible sum after \( k \) operations.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
