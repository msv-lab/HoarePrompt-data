### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and insert its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray can significantly increase the array's sum.
   - The optimal strategy often involves inserting sums of positive subarrays multiple times.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used correctly in the main logic to ensure the final result is within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it has some issues:
     - It does not handle negative subarrays correctly.
     - It only considers one segment at a time and does not explore combining different segments to form larger segments.
     - It does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of multiple subarrays.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should consider the sum of the entire array and the sum of positive subarrays.
   - We can insert the sum of the entire array multiple times to increase the overall sum.
   - For negative subarrays, we should avoid them since they decrease the sum.

5. **Current Implementation**:
   - The provided program uses `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray, which is flawed as explained above.
   - The main logic should calculate the sum of the entire array and the sum of positive subarrays.
   - It should determine how many full insertions of the entire array can be made within `k` operations.
   - Any remaining operations should be used to insert the sum of positive subarrays if possible.

6. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find the maximum sum subarray but fails to handle negative subarrays and does not combine segments effectively.
   - Given the issues with `func_2`, the overall approach of the program is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified that `func_2` does not handle negative subarrays and does not combine segments effectively. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to the flaws in `func_2` and the overall approach not being sound.
