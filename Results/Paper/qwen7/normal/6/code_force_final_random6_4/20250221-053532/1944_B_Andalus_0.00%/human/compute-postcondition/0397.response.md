Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sz` is incremented by 1 and `sng` must have at least one more element. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned. Since `elem` is not defined or given any specific value in the initial state, it implies that `elem` could be any value that is being iterated over or updated within the context of the loops or conditions described.

Given the print statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, the output will depend on the current value of `elem` at the point where this print statement is executed. Since no specific value is provided for `elem`, we can only describe it in a general sense.

Output: **elem (where elem is the current value of elem at the point of execution)**
