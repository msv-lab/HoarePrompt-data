Postcondition: `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, then after executing the if statement, `sz` is exactly `k` minus 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `sz` was not initially greater than or equal to `k` minus 2, the value of `sz` remains unchanged.
