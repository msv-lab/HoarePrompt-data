Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is now 3, the condition `i < n` will depend on the value of `n`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop head; it remains as it was at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
