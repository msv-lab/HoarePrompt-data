Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `sng`, the variable `elem` will take on the next element from `sng` in the next iteration.
   - The variable `sz` is incremented by 1, but it is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted here.
   - The fact that the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of does not affect the loop head variables directly, so no additional adjustments are needed for this condition.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sng` remains a non-empty iterable because it still contains elements to iterate over.
   - `elem` will be set to the next element in `sng`.
   - `sz` is already adjusted to be one more than its original value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1**
