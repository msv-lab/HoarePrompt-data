Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 4.
- `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
- `elem` is the third element of `sng`.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

Since `elem` is explicitly stated to be the third element of `sng`, and `sng` is a non-empty iterable, we can directly use this information.

Output: **the third element of sng**
