You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):

        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lft = lst[:n]

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of identical elements from the left half of the list and single occurrences from both halves up to a limit defined by k. After processing, it ensures all elements in the `sng` list have been printed and the `sz` variable equals the total number of elements in `sng`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that both `l` and `r` are subsets of the respective halves of the input array and that their XOR values match. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Subset Validation**: The program does not explicitly check if the selected elements from `lft` and `rgt` form valid subsets. It only ensures that the elements are unique within their respective halves but does not verify that they are subsets.

2. **XOR Calculation**: The program constructs `l` and `r` by directly printing elements without ensuring that their XOR values match. This approach might not always produce valid subsets `l` and `r`.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   2 1
   1 2 2 1
   ```

   The program outputs:
   ```
   2 1
   2 1
   ```

   While this output is technically correct for this specific case, it does not guarantee that the program will always produce valid subsets for all inputs. For instance, consider the input:
   ```
   4 1
   1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
   ```

   The program outputs:
   ```
   2 1
   2 1
   ```

   However, a valid solution could be:
   ```
   1 2
   3 4
   ```

   This shows that the program does not always generate valid subsets `l` and `r` that meet the problem requirements.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered fully correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
