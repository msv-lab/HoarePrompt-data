Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable (excluding the first element), `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1, and we continue the loop or if statement since `sz` is not yet greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the size counter `sz` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions for `sng`, `elem`, and `sz` remain as described in the initial state, but now `sz` is one more than its original value. The loop or if statement continues because `sz` is still less than `k`.
