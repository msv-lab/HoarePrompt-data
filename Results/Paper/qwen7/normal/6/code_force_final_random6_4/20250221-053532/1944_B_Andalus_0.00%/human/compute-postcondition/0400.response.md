Output State: **`sz` is `sz_prev + 1`, `sng` must have at least one more element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was checking if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. The values of `sz` and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial states.
