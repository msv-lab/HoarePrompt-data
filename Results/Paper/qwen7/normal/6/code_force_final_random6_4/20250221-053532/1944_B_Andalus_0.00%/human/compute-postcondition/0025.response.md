Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[2] != lft[1]` and `lft[2] != lft[3]` if `i` is 2, and `sng` contains the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[i]` if `i` is 2, and `ldb` is equal to `lft[3]` and `lft[3] != lft[2]` and `lft[3] != lft[4]` if `i` is 3, and `sng` contains the elements `lft[3]` and `lft[i]` if `i` is 3.
