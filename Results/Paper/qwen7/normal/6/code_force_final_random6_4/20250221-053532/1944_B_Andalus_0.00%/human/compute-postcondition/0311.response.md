Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, and `rdb` is an empty iterable, `rgt` is a slice of `lst` from index `n` to the end.**

Explanation: The code assigns the slice of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end to the variable `rgt`. The other variables (`sng`, `elem`, `sz`, `rdb`) remain unchanged.
