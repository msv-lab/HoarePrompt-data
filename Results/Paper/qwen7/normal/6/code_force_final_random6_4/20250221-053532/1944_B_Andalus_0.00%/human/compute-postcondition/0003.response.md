Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 5000, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by taking input from the user, splitting the input into individual elements, converting each element to an integer, and then mapping these integers into a list. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
