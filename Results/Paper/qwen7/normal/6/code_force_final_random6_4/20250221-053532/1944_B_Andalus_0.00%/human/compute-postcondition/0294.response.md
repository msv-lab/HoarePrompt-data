Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was likely iterating over `sng` or using `elem`. The values of `sng`, `elem`, and `sz` remain unchanged, but the program now breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
