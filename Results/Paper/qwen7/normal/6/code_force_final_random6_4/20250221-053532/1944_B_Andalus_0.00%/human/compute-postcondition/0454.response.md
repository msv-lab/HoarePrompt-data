Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is incremented by 1 (`sz = sz + 1`).
- If `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is exited.

However, the code snippet provided only contains a `print` statement with `elem` and uses `end=' '` to ensure the output is on the same line separated by a space. The value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied to be the element being processed in the loop or if statement context.

Given the information, the `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem**
