Output State: **All elements in `ldb` have been processed, `sz` is equal to `k` or more, and no further elements are printed.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, all elements in `ldb` would have been processed. The variable `sz` will be equal to `k` or more because the loop breaks when `sz >= k`. No further elements are printed because the loop condition `sz < k` is no longer satisfied.
