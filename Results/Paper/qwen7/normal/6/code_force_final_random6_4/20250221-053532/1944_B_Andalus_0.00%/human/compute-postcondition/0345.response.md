Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, the value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and the value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the value of `rgt[i - 1]`, which is `rgt[0]`, the list `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
