Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since `sz` was previously `sz` + 0 (implying its initial value before this operation), after executing the code, `sz` becomes `sz` + 1. The condition that `sng` must contain at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as stated above.
