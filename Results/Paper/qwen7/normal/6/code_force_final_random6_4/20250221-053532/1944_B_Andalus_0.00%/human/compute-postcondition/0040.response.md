Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the value of `rdb` is equal to the list containing the value of `rgt[i-1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, after executing the line `rdb.append(rgt[i])`, `i` increments to 2 (as list indices start from 0). The value of `rdb` becomes a list containing the value of `rgt[1]`, which is equal to `rgt[0]` according to the precondition. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
