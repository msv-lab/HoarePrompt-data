Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is either equal to its original value or its original value plus 2.
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2.
- After the execution of the if-else block, if `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice with a space as the separator.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its precise value. However, we know it is the element from `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the element from `ldb`)
