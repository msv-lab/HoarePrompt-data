Output State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`; `sz` is increased by 1; the most internal loop or if statement is exited if the condition `sz >= k` is met.**

This means that the sequence `sng` remains unchanged in terms of its elements, but the value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if the condition `sz >= k` is satisfied, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
