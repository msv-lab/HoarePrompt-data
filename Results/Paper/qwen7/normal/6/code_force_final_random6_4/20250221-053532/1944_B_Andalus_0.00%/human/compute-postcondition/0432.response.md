Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` plus 2, and `rdb` must still contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. Since `sz` was initially an integer greater than or equal to `k`, after adding 2, `sz` is now an integer greater than or equal to `k + 2`. The condition that `rdb` must still contain at least one element remains unchanged.
