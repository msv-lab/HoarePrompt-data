Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for elem in sng:` statement. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 3 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable (this means there is at least one element in `sng`).
   - `elem` is the first element of `sng` (this means `sng` had at least one element, and `elem` was set to that first element).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is the first element of `sng`, after processing one element, `sng` will now be an iterable without its first element (i.e., `sng` will be the remaining elements of the original `sng`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still be a non-empty iterable.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` is now an iterable with at least one element (the second element from the original `sng`), and `elem` is set to that second element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sz` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the second element of `sng`**
