Postcondition: `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Since there is no else part, the sequence `sng` remains unchanged if the condition `sz >= k` is not met.
