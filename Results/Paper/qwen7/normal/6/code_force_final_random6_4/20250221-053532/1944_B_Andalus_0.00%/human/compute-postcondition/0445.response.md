Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `sz` was being incremented. The value of `sng` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The increment of `sz` by 1 is also not affected by the `break` statement, so `sz` is updated to `sz + 1`.
