Output State: **`sz` is 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, the list `rdb` will contain all elements of `rgt` starting from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element in `rgt`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sz` to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the list `rdb` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `sz` is now 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and the list `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` starting from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element in `rgt`.
