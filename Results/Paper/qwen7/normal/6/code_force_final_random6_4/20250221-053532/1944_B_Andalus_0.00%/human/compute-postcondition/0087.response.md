Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a sequence containing at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz <= n-1`. The print statement simply prints the value of `elem` followed by a space, but the value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state.

Given that `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, since the print statement only depends on `elem`, and no other variables or conditions affect its value directly within the snippet provided, the output will depend solely on the value of `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the sequence sng that satisfies k <= sz <= n-1)**
