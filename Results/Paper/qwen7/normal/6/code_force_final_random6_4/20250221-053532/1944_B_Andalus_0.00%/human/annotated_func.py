#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

    #State: All elements in `sng` have been processed, `sz` is equal to the total number of elements in `sng`, and `rdb` remains empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of identical elements from the left half of the list and single occurrences from both halves up to a limit defined by k. After processing, it ensures all elements in the `sng` list have been printed and the `sz` variable equals the total number of elements in `sng`. The function does not return any value.
