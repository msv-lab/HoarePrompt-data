Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly defined in the given state, but it starts from 1 (as per the loop definition).
   - `n` is not explicitly defined either, but the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will run as long as `n > 1`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `sng` is an empty iterable.
- `elem` is the last element in an empty iterable (which is `elem` itself).
- `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1 (which is 1).
- `rdb` is now `['']`.
- `ldb` is an empty list.
- `lft` is an empty list.
- `rgt` is an empty list.

None of these variables are directly involved in the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
