Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`.
- `sz` is `sz_prev + 1`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- There is no else part, so the postcondition remains as described in the if part.

Given this, we know that `sz` is incremented from `sz_prev` and checked against `k`. Since the exact values of `sz_prev`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `sz`. However, we do know that `sz` is the next element in the sequence after `sz_prev` and it satisfies `k <= sz < n`.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it refers to the current element being processed in the sequence `sng`.

Therefore, the output will be the current element in the sequence `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the current element in the sequence sng)**
