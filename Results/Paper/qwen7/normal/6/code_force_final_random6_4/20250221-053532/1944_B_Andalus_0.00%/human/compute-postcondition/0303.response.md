Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty iterable (excluding the first element).
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

Since `elem` is the next element in the iterable `sng`, and `sng` is non-empty, `elem` must be the first element of `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of the non-empty iterable sng)**
