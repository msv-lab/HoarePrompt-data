Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `sz` will be an integer value that is at least `k` and no larger than `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`. `sz` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`; `sz` is increased by 1; the most internal loop or if statement is exited if the condition `sz >= k` is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`, and `sz` is `sz_prev + 1`, `sz` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
