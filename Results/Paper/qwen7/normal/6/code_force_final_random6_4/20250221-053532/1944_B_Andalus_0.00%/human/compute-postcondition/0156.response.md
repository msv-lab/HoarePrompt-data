Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `rdb` must not be empty.
   - `sz` is equal to `k` + `n`, where `n` is the total number of elements in `sng`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `T` iterations, but since `T` is not specified, we need to consider the general condition for the loop to execute one more time.

3. **Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for` loop:
   ```python
   for _ in range(T):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

4. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `_` (a dummy variable) and `T` (the number of iterations). However, since `T` is a constant and does not change within the loop, it does not affect the loop continuation condition directly. The loop will continue as long as the loop body does not cause an exit condition.

5. **Exit Conditions**: The loop will exit if:
   - `sz` reaches `k`.
   - `sng` is exhausted (i.e., all elements in `sng` have been printed).

6. **Current State**: Given that the loop continues to print each element from `sng` until either `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted, and considering that `sz` will eventually equal `k` plus the length of `sng` (assuming `sng` is fully iterated over before `sz` reaches `k`), the loop will continue to execute as long as `rdb` is not empty and `sz` is still less than `k` plus the length of `sng`.

7. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must still be non-empty, and `sz` must be less than `k` plus the length of `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `rdb` must not be empty.
- `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`**
