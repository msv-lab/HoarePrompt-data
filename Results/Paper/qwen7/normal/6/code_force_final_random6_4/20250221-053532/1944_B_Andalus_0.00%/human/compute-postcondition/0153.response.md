Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 3, `sng` must not be empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Initially, `sz` is equal to `k` + 2. After executing the code, `sz` becomes `k` + 3. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
