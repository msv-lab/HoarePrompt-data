Based on the initial state provided:

- `rdb` is not empty.
- `sz` is equal to `k` + 1.
- `sng` is not empty.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its precise value. However, we know that `elem` must exist and be a valid value for printing.

Output: **elem (where elem is the value being printed)**
