Based on the initial state provided, we know that `ldb` contains at least one element, and `sz` is either its original value or its original value plus 2. Additionally, the difference between `k` and `sz` is less than 2, meaning `sz` is very close to `k`.

The print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print two occurrences of the same element from `ldb`.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value it will print. However, we can say that it will print the same element twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
