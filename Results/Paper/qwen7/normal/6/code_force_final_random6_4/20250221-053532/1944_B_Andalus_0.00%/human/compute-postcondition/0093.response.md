Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- The sequence `sng` remains unchanged in terms of its elements.
- `sz` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is exited if the condition `sz >= k` is met.

However, the code snippet provided does not include any variables named `elem` or any context that would allow us to determine what `elem` might be. Given the information, it seems like `elem` is not directly related to the conditions described for `sz`.

Since the only print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`, and there is no explicit value or definition for `elem` provided, we cannot determine what `elem` is. Therefore, the output will be based on whatever value `elem` holds at the time of execution, which is not specified.

Output: **elem (where elem is an unspecified value)**
