Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 4, depending on whether `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` becomes 4. Otherwise, `sz` remains 2. `ldb` is a non-empty list, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
