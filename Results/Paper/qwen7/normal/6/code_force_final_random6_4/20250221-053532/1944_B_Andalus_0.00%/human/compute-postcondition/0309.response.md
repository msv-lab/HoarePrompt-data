Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, and `rdb` is an empty iterable, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by space.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by mapping each element from the input (split by spaces) to an integer. The other variables (`sng`, `elem`, `sz`, `rdb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
