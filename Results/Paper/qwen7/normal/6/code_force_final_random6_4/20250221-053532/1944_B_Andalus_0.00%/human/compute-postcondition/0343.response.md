Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1` inclusively.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` should be set to 1 initially.

4. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop runs up to `n-1`).

5. **Consider the Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `lft`, and `rgt`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their initial states do not affect the loop's execution. However, they are mentioned in the post-loop conditions and should be noted for completeness.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be at least 2.

The final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
