Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`.
- The value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

However, the initial state does not provide any explicit value or definition for `elem`. Since no value or formula for `elem` is given, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, the output will include `elem` twice, separated by a space, but without a specific numerical or descriptive value for `elem`.

Output: **elem elem**
