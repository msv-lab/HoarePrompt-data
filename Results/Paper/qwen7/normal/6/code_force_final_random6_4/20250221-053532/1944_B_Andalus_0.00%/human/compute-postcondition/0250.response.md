Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for elem in sng:` statement. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `sz` is 4 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't affect the loop continuation).
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable (this means `sng` still contains elements to iterate over).
   - `elem` is the second element of `sng` (this means the loop has already processed the first element).

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element to process. Since `elem` is currently the second element, the next element (the third element) will be processed in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: 
   - `sz` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sng` should still be a non-empty iterable, but now `elem` will be the third element of `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`sz` is 4, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the third element of `sng`**.
