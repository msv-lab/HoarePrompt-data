Output State: **`sz` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since the initial condition states that `sng` must have at least one element and if the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out, the increment operation is performed regardless of the value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains the same. Therefore, the only updated variable is `sz`, which is now incremented by 1.
