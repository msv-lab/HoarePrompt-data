You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Conversion to Integer List:**
   - The program converts the string `s` into a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().strip()))`.
   - This conversion is incorrect because `map(int, input().strip())` will convert each character to an integer, but it does not preserve the original string format. Instead, it should directly process the string without converting to integers.

3. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of zeroes in the string using `zeroes = s.count(0)`.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Two counters `cnt` are initialized to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost.

5. **Processing the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 0, it increments the count of zeroes and checks if there has been any 1 encountered before. If yes, it adds 1 to `ans`.
   - If the character is 1, it calculates the cost as `zeroes - cnt[0]` and adds it to `ans`.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. The current logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Input:** `10`
- **Expected Output:** `2`

The program should simulate the minimum cost to sort the string "10". However, the current logic does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the cyclic shifts and calculate the minimum cost. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(s) - 1:
            if s[i] == '1' and s[i + 1] == '0':
                # Find the position where the cycle starts
                start = i
                end = i + 1
                while end < len(s) and s[end] == '0':
                    end += 1
                # Calculate the cost of the cycle
                ans += end - start + 1
                i = end
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of string processing and cost calculation. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
