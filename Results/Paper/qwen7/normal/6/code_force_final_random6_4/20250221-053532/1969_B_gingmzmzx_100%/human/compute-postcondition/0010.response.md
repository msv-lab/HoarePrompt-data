Output State: **`ans` is 1, `cnt` is [1, 1], `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`, and the current value of `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt` is initialized as `[1, 1]`, `cnt[1]` is 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, the condition `if cnt[1] > 0` evaluates to `True`, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 0, so after executing the code, `ans` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
