Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`cnt`, `zeroes`, `t`, `n`, or `s`). Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
