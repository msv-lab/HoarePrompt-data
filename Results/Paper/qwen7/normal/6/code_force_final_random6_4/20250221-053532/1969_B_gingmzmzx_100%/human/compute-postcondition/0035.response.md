Output State: **`s` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the total number of zeros in the original list `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `ans` to 0. It does not perform any operations that would change the values of `s`, `cnt`, or `zeroes`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
