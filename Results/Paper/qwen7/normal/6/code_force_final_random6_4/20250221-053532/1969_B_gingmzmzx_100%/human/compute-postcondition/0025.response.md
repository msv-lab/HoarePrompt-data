Output State: **`ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `s` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
