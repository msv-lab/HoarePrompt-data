Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element; `temp` now includes (q + r) % n; `c` is either '0' or '?'**

Explanation: The code adds an element `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state of `ans` being a set with at least one element is preserved, and `c` remains unchanged as either '0' or '?'. The value of `temp` is updated to include the new element.
