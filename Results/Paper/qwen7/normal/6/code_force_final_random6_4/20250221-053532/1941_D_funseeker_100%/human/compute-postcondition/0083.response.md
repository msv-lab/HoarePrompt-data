Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for q in ans:`. This means the loop iterates over each element `q` in the set `ans`.

2. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - **`ans`**: The set `ans` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop is iterating over its elements.
   - **`q`**: The value of `q` will change to the next element in `ans` during the next iteration.
   - **`temp`**: The set `temp` is defined based on the current value of `q` and the variable `r`. Since `q` changes to the next element in `ans`, `temp` will be recalculated using the new value of `q`.
   - **`r`**: The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - **`c`**: The value of `c` is determined by calling `func_1()` and then splitting the result. Since `func_1()` is called once per iteration, the value of `c` will be updated based on the new call to `func_1()`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `ans` must have at least two elements (as per the postcondition).
   - `q` must be the second element in `ans` for the first iteration, the third element for the second iteration, and so on.
   - `temp` will include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `ans` remains the same.
- `q` becomes the second element in `ans` (since it was the second element in the previous iteration).
- `temp` is recalculated based on the new value of `q`.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `c` is updated based on the new call to `func_1()`.

Since the exact values of `ans`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, we can only express the state in terms of these variables.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'.**
