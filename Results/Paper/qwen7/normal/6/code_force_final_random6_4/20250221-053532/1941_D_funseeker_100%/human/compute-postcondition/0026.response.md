Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `temp` includes `(q + r) % n`, and `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` also includes `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already included `(q + r) % n` from the initial state, after executing this line, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The other variables `ans` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
