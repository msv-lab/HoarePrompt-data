Output State: **`ans` contains at least two elements, `temp` includes `(q + r) % n`, and `c` is either '1' or '?'**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The other variables `ans` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ans` still contains at least two elements, `temp` now includes the new element `(q + r) % n`, and `c` remains either '1' or '?'.
