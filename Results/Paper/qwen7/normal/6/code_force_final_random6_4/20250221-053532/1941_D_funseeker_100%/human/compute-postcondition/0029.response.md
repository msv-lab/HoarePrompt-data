Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` contains all the elements it was iterated over, `temp` includes every `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` calculated for each element `q` in `ans`, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.

This means that `temp` will contain the results of adding and subtracting `r` from every element `q` in `ans`, modulo `n`. The variable `c` remains either '1' or '?' throughout all iterations as per the conditions in the loop.
