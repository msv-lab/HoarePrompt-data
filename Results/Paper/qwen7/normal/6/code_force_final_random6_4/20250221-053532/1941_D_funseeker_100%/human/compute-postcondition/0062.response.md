Output State: **`ans` is equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, and `temp` contains three elements which are (`q - r`) % `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the value of the list `temp` to the variable `ans`. Since `temp` contains three elements which are all `(q - r) % n`, `ans` will also contain these three elements. The initial conditions of `ans` being empty and `temp` containing three elements which are `(q - r) % n` remain valid after the assignment.
