Output State: **`ans` contains all elements it was initialized with, `temp` is equal to `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `r` is a string, `c` is a string, and they are assigned the values from the function call `func_1().split()`**.

This means that the function `func_1()` returns a string which is then split into two parts, assigning these parts to `r` and `c`. The values of `ans`, `temp`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `m` is decremented by 1, though its specific value is not provided.
