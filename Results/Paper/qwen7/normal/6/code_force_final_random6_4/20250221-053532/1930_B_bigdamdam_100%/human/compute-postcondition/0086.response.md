Output State: `ind` is `2*n - 1`, `i` is `n`, and `p` is a list of length `n` where `p[i]` is `2*n - 1` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ind` will be `2*n - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `p` will be filled with the value `2*n - 1` for every index from `0` to `n-1`.
