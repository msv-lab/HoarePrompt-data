Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided solution attempts to construct such a permutation by alternating between even and odd indices.
3. Specifically, it initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros. It then fills the even indices with decreasing even numbers starting from `n` and the odd indices with increasing odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2`.
4. This approach ensures that the numbers at even and odd indices are interleaved and do not share the divisibility property required by the problem statement.
5. For example, if \( n = 4 \), the constructed permutation would be `[4, 1, 2, 3]`, which satisfies the condition since no pair of consecutive elements in the permutation shares the divisibility property mentioned.
6. The logic in the code correctly implements this strategy and produces a valid permutation for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is correct.
