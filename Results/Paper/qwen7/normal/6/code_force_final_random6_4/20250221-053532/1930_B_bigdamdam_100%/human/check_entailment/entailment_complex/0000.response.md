Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided code does not attempt to solve the problem as described. Instead, it initializes a list `p` of length `n` and fills it with the value `2*n - 1` for every index. This does not satisfy the condition of the problem because all elements in the list are the same, meaning any pair of consecutive elements will trivially divide each other.
3. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the solution should involve a more complex algorithm to ensure that no two consecutive elements have one dividing the other.

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
