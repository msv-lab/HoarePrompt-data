### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)), \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The program is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).

#### Given Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \). It creates a list \( p \) of length \( n \) and fills it with values based on the index \( i \). The function does not return any value but outputs the final state of the list \( p \) for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Filling the List:**
   - The list \( p \) is initialized with zeros.
   - The loop for even indices fills the list with decreasing values starting from \( n \) down to 1.
   - The loop for odd indices fills the list with increasing values starting from \( 1 + n \% 2 \) up to \( n \).

2. **Example for \( n = 6 \):**
   - For \( n = 6 \), the list \( p \) will be filled as follows:
     - Even indices (0, 2, 4): \( p[0] = 6 \), \( p[2] = 4 \), \( p[4] = 2 \)
     - Odd indices (1, 3, 5): \( p[1] = 3 \), \( p[3] = 5 \), \( p[5] = 7 \)
   - Resulting permutation: \( [6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 7] \)

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - We need to check if the permutation \( [6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 7] \) satisfies the condition:
     - \( p_1 = 6 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 4 \) and \( p_2 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 5 \).
     - \( p_2 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 5 \) and \( p_3 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 2 \).
     - \( p_3 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 2 \) and \( p_4 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 7 \).
   - All pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) satisfy the condition that neither \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) nor \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{i+2} \).

4. **General Case:**
   - For any \( n \), the constructed permutation ensures that no two consecutive elements have one dividing the other, as the values are alternately increasing and decreasing.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a permutation that meets the required condition for all \( n \geq 3 \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
