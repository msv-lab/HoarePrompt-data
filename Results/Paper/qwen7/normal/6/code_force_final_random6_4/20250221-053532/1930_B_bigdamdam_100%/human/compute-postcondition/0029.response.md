The code `n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]` takes an input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns the first element of that list to `n`. This means the value of `n` changes based on the input provided, while `p[i]`, `i`, and `ind` retain their initial conditions.

Given the initial conditions:
- `p[i]` is equal to `ind - 2*(n-1)` if `n` is odd, or `ind - 2*(n-2)` if `n` is even.
- `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even.
- `ind` is equal to `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 1)` if `n` is odd, or `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 2)` if `n` is even.

After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `n`. The values of `p[i]`, `i`, and `ind` remain as per their initial conditions based on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `ind - 2*(n-1)` if `n` is odd, or `ind - 2*(n-2)` if `n` is even; `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even; `ind` is equal to `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 1)` if `n` is odd, or `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 2)` if `n` is even; `n` is the first integer from the input.**
