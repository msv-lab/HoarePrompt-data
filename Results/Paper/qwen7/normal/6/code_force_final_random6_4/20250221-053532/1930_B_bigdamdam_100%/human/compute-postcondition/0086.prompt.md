Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `p[i]` is equal to `ind - 2*(n-1)` if `n` is odd, or `ind - 2*(n-2)` if `n` is even, `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even, and `ind` is equal to `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 1)` if `n` is odd, or `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n - 2)` if `n` is even.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The list `p` will have its even indices set according to the formula `ind - 2*i`, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) for even `n`, or `n-1` (inclusive) for odd `n`. The variable `ind` will be updated in each iteration, starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2 in each step until the loop condition `n > i + 2` is no longer satisfied, which happens when `i` reaches `n-1` for odd `n`, or `n-2` for even `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ind` is 9, `i` is 7, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its iterations:

1. The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since `range(1, n, 2)` starts at 1 and increments by 2).
2. For each iteration, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `ind`.
3. After assignment, `ind` is incremented by 2.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration (`i` is 1), `ind` is 3.
- After 2 iterations (`i` is 3), `ind` is 5.
- After 3 iterations (`i` is 5), `ind` is 7.

Following this pattern, we can deduce:
- After 4 iterations (`i` is 7), `ind` will be 7 + 2 = 9.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations would have `ind` as 9, `i` as 7 (the last value `i` takes before the loop ends), and `p` array populated as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ind` is 2*n - 1, `i` is n, `p` is filled from index 0 to n-1 with values from `2*n - 1` down to `2*n - 1 - 2*n`, and `p[i]` is `2*n - 1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ind` will be `2*n - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `p` will be filled from index 0 to n-1 with values starting from `2*n - 1` and decreasing by 2 for each subsequent index, down to `2*n - 1 - 2*n`. Additionally, the value at index `i` (which is `n`) in the list `p` will be `2*n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
