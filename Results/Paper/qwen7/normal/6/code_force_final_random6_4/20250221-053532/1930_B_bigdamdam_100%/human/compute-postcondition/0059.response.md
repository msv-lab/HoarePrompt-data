Output State: **`ind` is 9, `i` is 8, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7, `n` is the first integer from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `p` as a list of length `n` filled with zeros. The values of `ind`, `i`, `p[1]`, `p[3]`, `p[5]`, `p[7]`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
