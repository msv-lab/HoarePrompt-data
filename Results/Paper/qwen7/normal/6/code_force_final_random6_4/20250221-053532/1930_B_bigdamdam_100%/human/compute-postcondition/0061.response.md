Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values and their impact on the loop execution**:
   - `i` is initially set to 8.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input split into a list.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over even numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `n`, incrementing by 2 each time.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or less, the range function will not generate any numbers and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to 8, it does not affect whether the loop will execute or not. The loop will still execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`ind` is the first integer from the input split into a list, `i` is 8, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7, `n` must be greater than 0**
