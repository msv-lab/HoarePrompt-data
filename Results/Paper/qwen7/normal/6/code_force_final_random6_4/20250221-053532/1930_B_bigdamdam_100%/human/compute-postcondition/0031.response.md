Output State: **`p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n - 2` if `n` is even, `ind` is equal to `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input.**

Explanation: The line `ind = n` updates the value of `ind` to be equal to `n`. All other variables (`p`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
