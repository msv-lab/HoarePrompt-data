Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a set of integers from the input, sorts them, and then checks for consecutive pairs of elements that differ by exactly 1. Based on the count of such pairs (`cd`), it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console. If `cd` is odd, it prints 'Bob' and returns `None`; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.**
