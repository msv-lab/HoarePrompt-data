Output State: **Postcondition: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 0 or 1, and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the provided code snippet, the initial conditions remain valid.
