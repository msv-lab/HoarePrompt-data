### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a specified number of stones from each non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the player about to move will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, the player can make a move to force the Nim-sum to zero and thus win.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code imports necessary libraries but does not use them.
   - The `func_1` function reads the number of piles (`N`) and the sizes of the piles (`nums`).
   - It converts the input string to a set and then sorts it, which is unnecessary.
   - The logic to determine the winner is flawed:
     - It checks if there is only one pile (`len(nums) == 1`), which is correct.
     - It checks if there are two piles (`len(nums) == 2`), which is incorrect because the game logic should be based on the Nim-sum rather than just the count of piles.
     - It uses an incorrect approach to calculate the number of consecutive piles with a difference of 1 (`cd`), which does not align with the Nim-sum logic.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.
   - If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the current player can always make a move to force the Nim-sum to zero and win.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function processes the input, sorts the piles, and then incorrectly attempts to determine the winner using a count of consecutive piles with a difference of 1.
   - The logic in the annotated code does not reflect the correct Nim-sum logic.

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation would involve calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determining the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
