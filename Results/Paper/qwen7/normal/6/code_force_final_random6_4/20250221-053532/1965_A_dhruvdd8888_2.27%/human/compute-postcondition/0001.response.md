Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_N` represents the initial number of stones in each of the N piles, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile; `nums` is a set containing the strings split from the input.**

The code `nums = set(input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts that list into a set named `nums`. Since the initial values of `t`, `N`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_N` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. The new variable `nums` is created and contains the elements from the input line as strings.
