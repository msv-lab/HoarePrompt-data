Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the program assumes that the smallest nonempty pile size is always unique, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 2 2
```

In this case, the smallest nonempty pile size is 2, and both piles have this size. According to the game rules, a player can choose any positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile. Therefore, Alice can choose k=2 and remove 2 stones from each pile, leaving them all empty. This means Alice can make a valid move and win the game. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this scenario correctly, as it only checks the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of pile sizes. Thus, the program incorrectly prints "Bob" for this input, indicating that it does not work as expected for this potential case.
