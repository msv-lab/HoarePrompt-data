t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each of the n piles, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
