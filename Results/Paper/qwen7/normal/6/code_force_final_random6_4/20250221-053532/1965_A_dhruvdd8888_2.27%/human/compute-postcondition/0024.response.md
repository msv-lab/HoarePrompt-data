Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 1 or 2, `cd` is `cd` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cd` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `nums`, `i`, and the condition for `cd` remain unchanged. Therefore, `nums` is still a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is still 1 or 2, and `cd` is now one more than its original value.
