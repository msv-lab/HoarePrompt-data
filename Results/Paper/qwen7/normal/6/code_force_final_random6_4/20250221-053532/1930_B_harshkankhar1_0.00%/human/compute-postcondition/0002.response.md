Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to \(n\) inclusive with every second element reversed.

Let's break down the list `a`:
- The list starts with the integers from 1 to \(n\) in order.
- Every second element is then reversed.

For example, if \(n = 5\), the list `a` would look like this before reversing:
\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \]

After reversing every second element, it becomes:
\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \rightarrow [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \]
- The even-indexed elements (2nd, 4th, etc.) remain the same.
- The odd-indexed elements (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) remain the same since they are already in the correct position.

However, if \(n = 6\), the list `a` would look like this before reversing:
\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \]

After reversing every second element, it becomes:
\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \rightarrow [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \]
- The even-indexed elements (2nd, 4th, 6th) remain the same.
- The odd-indexed elements (1st, 3rd, 5th) remain the same.

In general, the list `a` will have the form where every second element remains unchanged, and the rest of the elements follow the original sequence.

Therefore, the print statement will output the list `a` as described above.

Output: **[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n] where every second element remains the same and the rest follow the original sequence**
