Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive with every second element reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`. This means that starting from index 0 (the first element), every alternate element in the list is reversed. For example, if `n` is 5, the original list `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and after executing the code, it becomes `[1, 5, 3, 4, 2]`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` now has its even-indexed elements reversed compared to their original order.
