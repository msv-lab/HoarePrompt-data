Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other changes are made to the variables `k`, `a[l]`, or `a[r]`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged except for `ans`, which is now increased by 1.
