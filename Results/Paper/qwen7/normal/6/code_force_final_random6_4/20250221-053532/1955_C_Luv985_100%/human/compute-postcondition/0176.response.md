Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. Here, `r` is `n - 1`, so `a[r]` is `a[n - 1]`. The value of `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`, so `a[n-1]` is decreased by `min(a[0], a[n-1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
