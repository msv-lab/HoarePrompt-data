Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is less than `r`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decrements the value of `a[r]` by the value of `mi`. The value of `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` is less than `r`. Since `a[l]` is already decreased by `mi`, the updated value of `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`. The value of `mi` remains the same, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.
