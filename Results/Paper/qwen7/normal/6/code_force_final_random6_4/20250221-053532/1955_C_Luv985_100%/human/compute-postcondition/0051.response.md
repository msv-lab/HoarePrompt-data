Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`, which means `t` will be 0 if `k` is even, and 1 if `k` is odd. The values of `k` and `mi` remain unchanged from their initial states.
