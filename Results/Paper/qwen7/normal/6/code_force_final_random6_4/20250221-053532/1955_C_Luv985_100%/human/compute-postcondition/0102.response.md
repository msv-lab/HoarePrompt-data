Postcondition: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.**
