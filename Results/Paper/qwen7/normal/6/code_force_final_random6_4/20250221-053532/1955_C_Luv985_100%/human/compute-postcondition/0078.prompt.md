Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `r` is `n - 1`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 0; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is reduced by 2 times the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` if `mi * 2 <= k`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `k % 2`. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is set to `k % 2`. The conditions remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` in both cases; `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi` if `a[r]` does not equal 0 after the reduction; `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` equals 0 after the reduction.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` must be less than `r`, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is not 0, the original conditions of `k`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
