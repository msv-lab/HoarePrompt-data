Postcondition: `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and the loop or if statement is exited without changing `ans`.
