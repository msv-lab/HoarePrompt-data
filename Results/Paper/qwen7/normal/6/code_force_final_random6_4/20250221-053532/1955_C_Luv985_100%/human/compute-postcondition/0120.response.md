Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, meaning `k -= mi * 2`. The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`, which was defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The conditions and relationships between the variables remain intact, just their values are updated according to the operations performed.
