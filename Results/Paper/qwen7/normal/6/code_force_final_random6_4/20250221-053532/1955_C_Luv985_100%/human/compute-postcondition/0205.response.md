Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer value, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 3`, `ans` is either 4 or 3, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
