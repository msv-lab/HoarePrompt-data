Output State: **`mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`.**

The code `t = k % 2` assigns the value of `k % 2` to the variable `t`. The initial state of `mi` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The value of `t` is now determined by the expression `k % 2`, but the exact value of `t` depends on the value of `k`.
