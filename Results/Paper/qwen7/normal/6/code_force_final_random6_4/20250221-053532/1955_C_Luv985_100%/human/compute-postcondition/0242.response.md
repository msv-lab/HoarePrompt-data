Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of ships \( n \), the durability reduction limit \( k \), and a list of ship durabilities \( a \). It then iteratively reduces the durability of the ships from both ends towards the center until no further reductions can be made or \( k \) becomes zero. The function counts the total number of ships whose durability is reduced to zero and prints this count for each test case.**
