Output State: **`n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `r` is `n - 1`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The values of other variables (`T`, `k`, `a`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
