Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` and `ans` is increased by 1 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are 0. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. If `k` is not reduced by `mi * 2` due to the condition `mi * 2 <= k` not being met, `k` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
