Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is reduced by 2 times the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` if `mi * 2 <= k`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `k % 2`. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is set to `k % 2`. The conditions remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
