Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. In this case, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2, and `ans` remains unchanged.
