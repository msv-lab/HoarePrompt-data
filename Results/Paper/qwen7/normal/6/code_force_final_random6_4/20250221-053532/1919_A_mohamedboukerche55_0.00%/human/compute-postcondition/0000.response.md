Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop, the loop will continue as long as the input value is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Initial States Given**: We know that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). However, these variables are not directly involved in the loop condition.

4. **Loop Condition Analysis**: The loop condition is based on the input value. For the loop to execute, the input value must be a non-negative integer. Since the input value is used to determine the number of iterations, it must be at least 1 (as per typical usage of `range()`).

5. **Adjusting the State**: The initial state of `a` and `b` does not affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted. The key is to ensure that the input value is at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which should be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\), and the input value must be at least 1**.
