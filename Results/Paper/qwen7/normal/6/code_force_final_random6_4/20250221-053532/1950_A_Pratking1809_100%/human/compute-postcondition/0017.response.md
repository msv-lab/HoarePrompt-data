Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not initialized before this operation, it's not clear what `i` is. However, the value of `i` after this operation will be 1 (assuming `i` was 0 before).
- `q` must be greater than `i + 1`, so `q` could be any integer greater than 2.

The print statement is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'PEAK'. Since no variables are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **PEAK**
