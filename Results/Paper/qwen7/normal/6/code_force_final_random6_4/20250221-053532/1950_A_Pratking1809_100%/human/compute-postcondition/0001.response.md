Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `q`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `q` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is at least 1.
4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `q`, we need to ensure that `q` is at least 1. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q` being at least 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1**
