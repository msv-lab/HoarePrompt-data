Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- It is not true that `a < b < c`.
- The current value of `b` is greater than `a` and `c`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('PEAK')` will simply print the string 'PEAK' because it does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Output: **PEAK**
