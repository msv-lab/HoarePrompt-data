Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the actual values are not specified, they are represented as integers entered by the user. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
