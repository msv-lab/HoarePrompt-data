You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` has been incremented for each iteration up to `q-1`. For each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers as provided by the user. Depending on the conditions met (`a < b < c` or `a < b > c`), the loop printed either 'STAIR' or 'PEAK'. If neither condition was met, it printed 'NONE'. After all iterations, the loop would have printed one of these messages for each of the `q` sets of inputs provided. The variable `i` will be equal to `q-1`, and `q` will remain unchanged. The variable `t` from the initial state will still be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, as it was not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating whether the given conditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) are met.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
