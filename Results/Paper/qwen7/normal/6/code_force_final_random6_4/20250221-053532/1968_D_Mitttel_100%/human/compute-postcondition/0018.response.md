Output State: **`vis[s]` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code `vis[s] = 1` sets the value of `vis[s]` to `1`, which means `vis[s]` is now `True`. To satisfy the loop condition `not vis[s] and k > 0`, `vis[s]` must be `False`, so we adjust it to `0`. The value of `k` must be at least `1` to ensure `k > 0` when the loop starts. The other variables (`mx`, `s`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
