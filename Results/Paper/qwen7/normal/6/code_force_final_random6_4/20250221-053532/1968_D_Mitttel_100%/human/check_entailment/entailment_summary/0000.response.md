Reasoning:
1. The main loop of the program correctly processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` for `k` turns.
3. The logic inside `func_1` is sound: it iterates through the permutation, updating the current score and the maximum score, and ensures no position is revisited.
4. The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function and prints the result accordingly.
5. The provided execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1` function.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
