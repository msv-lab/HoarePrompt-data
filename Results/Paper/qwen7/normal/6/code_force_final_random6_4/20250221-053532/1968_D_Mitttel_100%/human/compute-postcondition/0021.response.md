Output State: **`vis[s]` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.**

This means that `k` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables (`vis[s]`, `mx`, `s`, and `cur`) remain as described in the initial state, with `mx` being updated based on the new value of `k`.
