Output State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, `cur` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game, `vis` is a list of n elements where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `vis` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `mx`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, `cur`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `vis` is now a list of `n` zeros.
