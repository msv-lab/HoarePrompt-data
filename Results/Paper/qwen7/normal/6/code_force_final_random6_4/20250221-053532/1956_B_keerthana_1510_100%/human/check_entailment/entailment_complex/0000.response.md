Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func()` attempts to calculate the number of unique tokens (integers) in each line of input, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards, considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

The function does the following:
1. Opens the standard input and iterates over every second line starting from the third line.
2. Splits each line into tokens and calculates the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
3. Prints the result for each line.

This logic does not address the game rules or the strategic aspect of the game where you and Nene take turns optimally to maximize or minimize scores.

Given the problem requirements, the function should:
1. Parse the input to extract the number of cards `n` and the integers on the cards in your hand.
2. Simulate the game turns, considering Nene's optimal strategy.
3. Determine the maximum number of points you can achieve under these conditions.

Since the provided function does not implement the required logic to solve the problem, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
