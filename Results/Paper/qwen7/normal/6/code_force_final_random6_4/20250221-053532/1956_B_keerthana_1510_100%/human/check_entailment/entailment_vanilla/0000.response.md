Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally.
2. The provided code does not match the problem requirements at all. Instead, it reads input from stdin (indicated by `[*open(0)]`), but it processes the input incorrectly.
3. Specifically, the code splits each line into tokens and calculates the difference between the length of the list of tokens and the length of the set of tokens. This operation does not relate to the logic required to solve the problem.
4. The logic needed to solve this problem involves understanding the distribution of cards and how to play optimally to maximize your score while minimizing your opponent's score. The given code does not address these aspects.

Given the mismatch between the problem and the provided code, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
