Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

   Here, `line` is the third line of input that the loop will process after reading the first two lines. Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:
   - `line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of tokens (words or substrings).
   - `tokens := line.split()` assigns this list to the variable `tokens` using the assignment expression (`:=`).
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list `tokens`, removing any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the list.

3. **Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens will be printed.
   - If there are no duplicates, the difference will be zero because the number of tokens and unique tokens would be the same.
   - If there are duplicates, the difference will be the count of duplicate tokens.

Given the initial state, the exact content of `line` is not specified, but we know it will be a string with potentially repeated words or substrings. The output will be the count of duplicate tokens in this string.

Output: **the count of duplicate tokens in the third line of input (where the third line is split into tokens and duplicates are counted)**
