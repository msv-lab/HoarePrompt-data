You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list a.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has processed every line of input that fits the specified pattern (every second line starting from the third line). `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`, and there are no more lines left to process according to the loop's condition.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the loop has gone through all valid input lines, and now the program is ready to terminate or proceed with any post-loop operations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` containing `n` elements where each element is between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and appears at most twice. It also accepts two positive integers `t` and `n` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. Based on the input, the function returns specific information about the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
