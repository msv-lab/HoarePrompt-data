Output State: **`bets` is a value entered by the user, `t` remains 0, `i` is the length of the list `a` which is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of `bets`, `t`, `i`, `a`, or `prod`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
