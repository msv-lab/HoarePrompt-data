Output State: **`bets` is 0, `i` must be less than `len(l)`, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `sumo` is the sum of all these updated elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces, and `T` is `T + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
