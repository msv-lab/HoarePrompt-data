Postcondition: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is the length of `a`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces, and `T` is `T + (len(l) - 1) * bets`.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, `sumo` will hold the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each iteration where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets-1`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each of its elements is now equal to `prod // a[i]`. The variable `bets` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, `ans` will contain the space-separated string representation of the updated list `a`, and `T` will have been incremented by `(len(l) - 1) * bets` due to the loop's iterations.
