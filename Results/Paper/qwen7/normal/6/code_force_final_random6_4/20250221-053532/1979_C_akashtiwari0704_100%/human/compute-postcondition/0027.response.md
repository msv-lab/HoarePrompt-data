Output State: **`a[i]' is updated to `prod // a[i+1]', `sumo' is increased by int(a[i]) and now `sumo' is the sum of all int(a[i]) values from the initial state**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` was updated to `prod // a[i+1]`, and `sumo` was increased by the integer value of `a[i]`. The output state includes the updated value of `a[i]` and the new value of `sumo` which is the cumulative sum of all `int(a[i])` values from the initial state.
