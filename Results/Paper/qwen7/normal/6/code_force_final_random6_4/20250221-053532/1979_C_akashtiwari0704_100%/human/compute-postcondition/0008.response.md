Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each element in the list `l` using `range(len(l))`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements
   - `i` is 2

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will check if `i < len(l)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to 3.
   - The list `l` remains unchanged because no modifications were mentioned in the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `g` remains `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`.
   - `l` remains a list with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is now 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 3**
