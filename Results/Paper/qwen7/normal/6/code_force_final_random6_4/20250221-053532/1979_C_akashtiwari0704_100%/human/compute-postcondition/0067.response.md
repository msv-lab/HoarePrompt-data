Output State: **`sumo` is `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i]) + int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The line `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the value of `int(a[i])` to `sumo`. Given that `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `int(a[i])` is simply `a[i]` (since `a[i]` is already an integer). Therefore, `sumo` is updated to include `int(a[i])` twice, resulting in `0 + prod // a[i] + int(a[i]) + int(a[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
