Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(l))`.
   - The variables involved here are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `g` is 1.
   - We need to focus on `i` and `l`.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(l)` is at least 1 (i.e., `l` is a non-empty list).
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we don't need to change its initial value.
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must be a non-empty list. This means `len(l)` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `l` must be a non-empty list (i.e., `len(l) > 0`).

Putting this together, the final state is:
**`t` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must be a non-empty list**.
