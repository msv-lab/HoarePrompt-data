Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is set to 0.
- `i` is equal to the length of the list `a`.
- Each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices.
- `sumo` is the sum of all these updated elements in the list `a`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `-1` without any reference to the other variables or their values.

Output: **-1**
