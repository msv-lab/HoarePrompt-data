Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. After processing, the variable `g` holds the GCD of all elements in `l`, and this value is returned. The function updates the variable `i` to be the length of the list `l` minus one, and it ensures that `g` is the GCD of all elements in `l` after performing a series of multiplications and divisions within a loop. The final state of the program includes `g` containing the desired GCD value.**
