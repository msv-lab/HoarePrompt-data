Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the list `l`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[0] * l[1] // gcd(g, l[0]) // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[1])`.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `l`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (assuming the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The value of `g` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop head.
   - The value of `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue requires that `i < len(l)`. Therefore, `len(l)` must remain the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`g` is `g * l[0] * l[1] // gcd(g, l[0]) // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[1])`, `i` is 2**
