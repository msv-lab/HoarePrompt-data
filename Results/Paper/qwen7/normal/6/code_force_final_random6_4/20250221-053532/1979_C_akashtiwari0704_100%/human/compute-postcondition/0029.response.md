Postcondition: **`bets` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, each element in `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices, and `sumo` will be the sum of all these updated elements in the list `a`. The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
