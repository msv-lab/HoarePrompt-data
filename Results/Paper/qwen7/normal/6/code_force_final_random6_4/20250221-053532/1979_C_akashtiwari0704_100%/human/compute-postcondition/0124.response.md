Postcondition: **`sumo` will be the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` will be `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`, `bets` will ensure the loop runs the required number of times, `a` will consist of the updated values, and `prod` remains the LCM of the elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `sumo` will be greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, the loop will execute `bets` times, `i` will be `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`, `ans` will be a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a`, separated by spaces, and `bets` will be a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.**
