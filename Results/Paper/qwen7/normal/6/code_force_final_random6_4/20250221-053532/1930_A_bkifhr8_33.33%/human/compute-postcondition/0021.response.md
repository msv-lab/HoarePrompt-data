Output State: **`ans` is the initial value plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `lst` has a length of 1, the first element of `lst` is the second element of the original `lst`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is the same as index `0`, from the list `lst`. Since `i` is 2 and the operation does not affect `i`, `ans`, or `n`, these variables remain unchanged. The length of `lst` is now 1, and its only element is what was originally at index 1.
