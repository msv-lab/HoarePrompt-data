Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ans`: The value of `ans` depends on the length of `lst`.
     - If `len(lst) != 2`, then `ans = 0 + \min(\text{int}(lst[0]), \text{int}(lst[1]))`.
     - If `len(lst) == 2` or the second element has been removed, then `ans = 2 \times \min(\text{int}(lst[0]), \text{int}(lst[1]))`.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is 2 if `len(lst) != 2`, and 1 if `len(lst) == 2` or the second element has been removed.
   - `n`: `n` is greater than 0 in both cases.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n * 2 - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 if `len(lst) != 2`, and 1 if `len(lst) == 2` or the second element has been removed.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.
   - Since `i` was 2 or 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to 3 or 2 respectively.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 if `len(lst) != 2`, and 2 if `len(lst) == 2` or the second element has been removed.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, and `n` remains greater than 0.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is either 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, or twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2 or the second element has been removed if the length is not 2. `i` is 3 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is 2 or the second element has been removed. `n` must be greater than 0.**
