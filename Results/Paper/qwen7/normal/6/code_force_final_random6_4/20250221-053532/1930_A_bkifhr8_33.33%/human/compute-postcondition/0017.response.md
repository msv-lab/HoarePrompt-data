Postcondition: `ans` is 0 plus the minimum value between the first and second elements of `lst` (after converting them to integers). `n` must be greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` has been removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
