Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the value of `min(int(lst[1]), int(lst[2]))` added to its previous value, `lst` is [3, int(lst[2])]**

Explanation: The code removes the second element (index 1) from the list `lst`. Since the list was originally `[i, lst[1], lst[2]]` and `i` is 3, after removing the second element, the list becomes `[3, lst[2]]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is based on the previous values of the list elements, which are now adjusted.
