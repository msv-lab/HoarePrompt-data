Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to an integer, and the second element of `lst` (index 1) has been removed.
