Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `i` is equal to `n * 2 + 1`.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly stated, but it is used in the loop condition `range(n * 2)`.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n * 2)`, meaning `i` will iterate from `0` to `n * 2 - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n * 2` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized as `n * 2 + 1`, it means `i` starts at `n * 2 + 1`. However, the loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until it reaches `n * 2 - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `n * 2` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` being `n * 2 + 1` ensures that the loop will start with `i = 1` (since `i` will decrement from `n * 2 + 1` to `0`).

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `ans`, `l`, and `lst` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`**
