Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer, `n` is an unspecified integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `ans_f` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans_f` contains the final value of `ans`, which is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst`, as long as `lst` contains at least two elements. The loop will continue to execute until `lst` has less than two elements or the loop completes its full iteration based on the value of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans_f` contains the last computed `ans`, `i` is equal to `n * 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will have executed `n * 2` times, `i` will be equal to `n * 2`, `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` for each iteration where the length of `lst` is not 2, and `ans_f` will contain the final value of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
