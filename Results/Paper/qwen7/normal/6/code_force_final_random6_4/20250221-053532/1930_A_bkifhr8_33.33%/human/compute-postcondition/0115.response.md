Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \). It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive integers from the list \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \) until fewer than two integers remain. The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed out. After processing all test cases, the list containing the results is empty.**
