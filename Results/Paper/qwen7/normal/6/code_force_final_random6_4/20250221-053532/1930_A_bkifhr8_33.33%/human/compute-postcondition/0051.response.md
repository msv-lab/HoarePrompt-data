Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `ans`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition regarding `ans` remains valid.
