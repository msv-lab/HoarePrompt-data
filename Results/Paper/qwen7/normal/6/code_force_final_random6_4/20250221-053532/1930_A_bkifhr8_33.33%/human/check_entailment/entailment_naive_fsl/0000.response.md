Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains duplicate smallest elements correctly. Specifically, the program only removes two elements at a time and adds the minimum of those two to the score. This approach fails when there are multiple occurrences of the smallest element, as it may not always choose the optimal pair to maximize the score.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2
1 1 2 1
```

The correct output should be `2`, as we can pair `1` and `1` twice, achieving a score of `1 + 1 = 2`. However, the current implementation might not always achieve this, leading to a lower score. For instance, it might pair `1` and `2` first, resulting in a score of `1`, and then pair the remaining `1` and `1`, again adding `1`, for a total score of `2`. But in the optimal solution, we should pair `1` and `1` twice to get a score of `2`.

To fix this, the program should sort the list and then pair the smallest elements sequentially, ensuring that all occurrences of the smallest elements are paired optimally.
