Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
   - `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` if the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the range function, but it is not directly modified within the loop (it is incremented by the loop itself).
   - The loop does not directly modify `n`, but it can affect the loop continuation based on the condition `i < n * 2`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n * 2 + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will not be less than `n * 2` and thus the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts at `n * 2 + 1`, it will not enter the loop again because `i` will always be equal to or greater than `n * 2`.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` or `n` for the next iteration.
   - The postconditions for `ans` and `lst` remain as they are since the loop does not execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` if the length of `lst` is not 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Since the loop does not execute, the values of `i` and `n` do not change, and the conditions for `ans` and `lst` remain the same.
