Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` by the amount of that minimum value.**

Explanation: The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` updates the value of `ans` by adding to it the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged, but `ans` is now increased by the smaller of the two values from `lst`.
