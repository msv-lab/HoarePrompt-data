Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - The postcondition includes conditions related to `lst` and `ans`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n * 2)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < n * 2`.

3. **Current Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 as no modification is specified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
