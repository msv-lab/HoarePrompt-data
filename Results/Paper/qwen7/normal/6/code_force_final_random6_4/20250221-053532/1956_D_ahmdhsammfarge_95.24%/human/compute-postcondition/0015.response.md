Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `i + 1` to `len(lst)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is 0
   - `l` is the length of `lst`
   - `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is the length of `lst`
   - `sm` is the length of `lst`
   - If the length of `lst` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` are adjusted accordingly.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `lst`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts from `i + 1`).
   - Therefore, `j` will become `len(lst) + 1`.

5. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `j` is less than `len(lst)`.
   - Since `j` is currently `len(lst)`, it does not satisfy the condition `j < len(lst)`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop cannot execute again because `j` is already equal to `len(lst)` and the loop condition `j < len(lst)` is not met.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are only those related to the loop head variables `i` and `j`.

**Final State**:
- `r` remains 0
- `l` remains the length of `lst`
- `over_sum` remains the sum of the list `lst`
- `i` remains 0
- `j` becomes `len(lst) + 1`
- `sm` remains the length of `lst`

State: **`r` is 0, `l` is the length of `lst`, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst) + 1, `sm` is the length of `lst`**
