Functionality: **The function reads two inputs: the number of elements `n` and a list of `n` integers `p`. It then checks if there exists any index `i` such that the value at index `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, it prints '2' and returns. If no such index is found after checking all elements, it prints '3' and returns `None`.**
