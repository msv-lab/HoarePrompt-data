Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `v` with the first element being `0`. It then takes input from the user, splits it into separate elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then appended to the list `v`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
