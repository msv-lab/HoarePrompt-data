Postcondition: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is updated to `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.**
