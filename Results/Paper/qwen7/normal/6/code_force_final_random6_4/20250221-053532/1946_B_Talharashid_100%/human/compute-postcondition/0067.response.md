Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, and `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = 0` sets `maxi` to 0. The values of `c`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
