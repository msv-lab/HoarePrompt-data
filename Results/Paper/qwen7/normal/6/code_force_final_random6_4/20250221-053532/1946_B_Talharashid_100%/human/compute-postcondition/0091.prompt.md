Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, and `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ele` is an integer and `c` is an integer. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ele` is 5, `c` is either 0 or 13, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `5`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` remains 8. Otherwise, `c` is set to 13 and `maxi` becomes 13.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is either `0` if `ele` is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to `c`, or `13 + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `13 + ele` and `13`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
