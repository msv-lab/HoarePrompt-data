Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `c` is the final accumulated value of `ele` based on the given conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is now a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is now an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, and `l` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps each string to an integer, creating a list of integers. This list replaces the value of `l`, which was initially an empty list. The other variables (`maxi`, `c`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
