Output State: **`l` must have at least one integer element, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is now `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. Since `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is updated to `c + ele`. The value of `maxi` remains the maximum of the new value of `c` (which is `c + ele`) and its previous value.
