Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.

We need to determine the value of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` and print it.

However, the values of `k`, `l`, and `sum(l)` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. We can only describe the components of the expression.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `k` is an unknown integer, `l` is a list, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`)**
