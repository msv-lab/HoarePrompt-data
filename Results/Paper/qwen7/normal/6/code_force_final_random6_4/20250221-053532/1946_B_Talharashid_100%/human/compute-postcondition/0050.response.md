Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `l`. The precondition that `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi` remains true, and `c` is updated based on the previous iteration.
