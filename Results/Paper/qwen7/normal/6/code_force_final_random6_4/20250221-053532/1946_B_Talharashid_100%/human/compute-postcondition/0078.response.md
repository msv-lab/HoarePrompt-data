Output State: **`ele` is 5, `c` is 8, `maxi` is 8**

Explanation: Initially, `ele` is 5, `c` is 8, and `maxi` is not defined. The code assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `maxi` is not defined, it defaults to 0 (or no value), and the maximum between `c` (which is 8) and 0 is 8. Therefore, `maxi` is updated to 8. The values of `ele` and `c` remain unchanged.
