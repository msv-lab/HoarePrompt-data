Output State: **`ele` is an integer less than 0, `c` is an integer less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The variable `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which was previously set) and the value of `c`. Since `c` is an integer less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, and `ele` is an integer less than 0, `maxi` will be updated to the larger of these two values.
