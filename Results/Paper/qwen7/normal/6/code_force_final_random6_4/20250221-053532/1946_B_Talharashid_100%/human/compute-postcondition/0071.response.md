Output State: **`ele` is an integer less than 0, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. Since `ele` is an integer less than 0 and `c` was previously less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` remains unchanged. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `0` (the new value of `c`) and its previous value.
