Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` + `ele` and `maxi`; `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its previous value; `i` remains unchanged; `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c + ele` and the current `maxi`. It also updates `c` by adding `ele` to its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
