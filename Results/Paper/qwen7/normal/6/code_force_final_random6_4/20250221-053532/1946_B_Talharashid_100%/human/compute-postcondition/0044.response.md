Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `c` is `c + ele`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers, and either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states. The condition regarding `ele` and `c` relative to `abs(ele)` also remains valid.
