Output State: **`ele` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and `c` is increased by `ele`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. Since `ele` is an integer and its value is greater than or equal to 0, and the condition that `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele` is also satisfied, `c` is updated to `c + ele`. The initial conditions for `ele` and `c` remain valid post-execution, just with `c` now holding the new value.
