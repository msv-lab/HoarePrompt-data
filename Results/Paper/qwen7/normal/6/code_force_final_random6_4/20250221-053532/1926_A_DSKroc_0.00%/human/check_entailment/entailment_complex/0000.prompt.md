Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: All characters in the string `s` have been iterated over `t` times, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters in `s`. The variable `q` ranges from 0 to `t-1` after all iterations, and `s` is the original input string without any modifications. `i` is irrelevant since the loop has completed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ac` will hold the total number of 'A' characters in the input string `s`, `bc` will hold the total number of non-'A' characters in `s`, `q` will range from 0 to `t-1` (where `t` is the initial input), and `s` will remain unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: 'A'
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: 'B'
    #State: All characters in the string `s` have been iterated over `t` times, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters in `s`. The variable `q` ranges from 0 to `t-1` after all iterations, and `s` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition holds true; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and an input string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string `s`. After processing, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', and prints 'B' otherwise. The function does not modify the input string `s` and returns nothing.
