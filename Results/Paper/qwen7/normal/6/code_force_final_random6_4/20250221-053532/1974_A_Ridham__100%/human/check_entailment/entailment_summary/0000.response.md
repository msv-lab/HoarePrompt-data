Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid. However, there are several issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

1. The calculation of `space_x` and `space_y` is incorrect. `space_x` should represent the total space needed for 1x1 icons, which is simply `x`, not `x * 1`. Similarly, `space_y` should be `y * 4`, but this value is not used correctly in the subsequent calculations.

2. The calculation of `screen_require_for_y` is incorrect. It should be based on the total space available per screen, which is 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), not just `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`.

3. The logic for determining the number of extra screens needed is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
