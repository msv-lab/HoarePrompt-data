Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4 * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input, `y` is updated to the second integer from the input, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 * 4 + x * 1`, and `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd.**

Explanation: The code updates `remaining_cells` to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. Since `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells` is recalculated using this value. The other variables remain unchanged.
