Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `space_x = x * 1` simply assigns the value of `x` to `space_x`. Since `x * 1` is equivalent to `x`, `space_x` is set to the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
