State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, result is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` (an underscore) is used as a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop itself. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `_`.
- The loop runs `n` times, so `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The initial state of `t` and `result` does not affect whether the loop can execute, so they remain as given.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring it is greater than 0.
