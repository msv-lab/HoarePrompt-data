Based on the initial state described, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is the number of iterations the loop will run.
   - `result` is an empty list that will store the results of each iteration.
   - `remaining_cells` is recalculated for each iteration based on the current values of `y` and `space_y`.
   - `space_x` remains constant and is initialized to `x * 1`.
   - `space_y` is updated to `y * 4` for each new iteration.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`.
   - `t` and `n` retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
   - `x` and `y` are updated with new input values for each iteration.
   - `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` based on whether `y` is even or odd.
   - `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the values of `y` and `space_y` change, affecting `remaining_cells`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_screen`.
   - The result for each iteration is either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The `result` list contains the outcomes of each iteration.
   - The `print` statement outputs each element of the `result` list on a new line.

Given the above steps, the output will be a series of lines, each representing the outcome of one iteration of the loop. The exact values depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, `remaining_cells`, and other variables during each iteration.

Output: **the outcome of each iteration (either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y) on a new line**
