Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input, `y` is updated to the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `space_x = x * 1` simply updates the value of `space_x` to be equal to `x`. Since `x` was previously updated to the first integer from the input, `space_x` now equals `x * 1`, which is just `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
