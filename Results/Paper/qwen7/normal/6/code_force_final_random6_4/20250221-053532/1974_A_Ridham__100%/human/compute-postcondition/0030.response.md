Output State: **`remaining_cells` must be greater than 0, `space_x` retains its initial value, `space_y` retains its initial value, `total_space` retains its initial value, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Since the initial values of `remaining_cells`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, and `y` are not specified, we only know that `remaining_cells`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, and `result` retain their initial values, while `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers.
