Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code calculates `remaining_cells` based on the value of `screen_require_for_y`, which is determined by whether `y` is even or odd. The values of `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` remain unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this line of code.
