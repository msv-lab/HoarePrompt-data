You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is correct since each `1x1` icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The variable `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which is also correct since each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The total space required is calculated as `total_space = space_y + space_x`. This is correct as it sums up the space occupied by all icons.

3. **Screen Requirement for `2x2` Icons**:
   - The variable `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on the number of `2x2` icons. If `y` is even, it uses `y // 2`; otherwise, it uses `y // 2 + 1`. This is correct because each `2x2` icon requires 2 cells, and we need to account for the remainder when dividing by 2.
   - The remaining cells after placing all `2x2` icons are calculated as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is correct as it calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all `2x2` icons.

4. **Checking Remaining Space for `1x1` Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining space (`remaining_cells`) is sufficient to fit all `1x1` icons (`space_x`). If so, it directly uses the `screen_require_for_y` value.
   - If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons. This part seems to have some issues:
     - The logic for calculating `extra_screen` is flawed. The formula `extra_screen = (space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` does not correctly handle the remainder when dividing by 15. For example, if `space_x - remaining_cells` is 14, the current logic would add an extra screen, but it should not.
     - The correct approach should be to calculate how many full 15-cell screens are needed and then check if there are any remaining cells that require an additional screen.

### Corrected Logic for Remaining Space

To fix the logic, we should:
- Calculate the number of full 15-cell screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons using integer division.
- Check if there are any remaining cells that require an additional screen.

Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
if space_x > remaining_cells:
    extra_screens = (space_x - remaining_cells) // 15
    if (space_x - remaining_cells) % 15 != 0:
        extra_screens += 1
    result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screens)
else:
    result.append(screen_require_for_y)
```

### Final Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program has a flaw in calculating the additional screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
