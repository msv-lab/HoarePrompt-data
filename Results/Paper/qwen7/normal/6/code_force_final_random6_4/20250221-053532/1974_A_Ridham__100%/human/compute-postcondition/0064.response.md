Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the input integer provided at the start. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the number of elements that satisfy the conditions specified within the loop. Each element in the list represents the value of `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions met during each iteration.

- `remaining_cells` will be recalculated for each iteration based on the current values of `y` and `space_y`.
- `space_x` will remain constant as it is initialized to `x * 1` and does not change throughout the loop.
- `space_y` will be updated to `y * 4` for each new iteration.
- `total_space` will be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`.
- `t` and `n` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
- `x` and `y` will be updated with new input values for each iteration.
- `screen_require_for_y` will be either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` based on whether `y` is even or odd.
- `extra_space` will be `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `extra_screen` will be calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise.

The final `result` list will contain the outcomes of each iteration, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, depending on the conditions evaluated in the loop.
