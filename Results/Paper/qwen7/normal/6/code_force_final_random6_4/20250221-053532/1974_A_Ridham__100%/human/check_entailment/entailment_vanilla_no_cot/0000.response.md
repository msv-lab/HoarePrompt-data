Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Here's why:

1. **Space Calculation**: The calculation of `space_x` and `space_y` is incorrect. For `1x1` icons, the space required is simply `x`, and for `2x2` icons, it should be `y * 4`. However, the program incorrectly calculates `space_x` as `x * 1` and `space_y` as `y * 4`.

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for `2x2` icons (`screen_require_for_y`) is flawed. It assumes that each `2x2` icon requires half a screen, which is not accurate. Instead, we need to consider how many `2x2` icons fit into a single screen and then calculate the remaining space.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The way the remaining cells are calculated and used to determine additional screens is incorrect. The program does not properly account for the layout constraints of the grid.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Total number of cells available on one screen
        cells_per_screen = 5 * 3
        
        # Calculate the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_2x2 = y // 2
        remaining_2x2 = y % 2
        
        # Calculate the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons
        cells_occupied_by_2x2 = full_screens_for_2x2 * 4 + (remaining_2x2 * 4)
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = cells_per_screen * (full_screens_for_2x2 + (1 if remaining_2x2 > 0 else 0)) - cells_occupied_by_2x2
        
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells = min(x, remaining_cells)
        
        # Remaining 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the remaining cells
        remaining_1x1_icons = x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (remaining_1x1_icons + cells_per_screen - 1) // cells_per_screen
        
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = full_screens_for_2x2 + (1 if remaining_2x2 > 0 else 0) + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        result.append(total_screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons according to the given constraints.
