Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(nums)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 (the default starting value for `range`).
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, the loop will run for each index from 0 up to but not including `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 0.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `ls` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution, but `nums` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element**.
