Output: **Bob**

Explanation: The print statement `print('Bob')` directly prints the string 'Bob'. According to the initial state, `cw` is a boolean flag set to `False`, `nw` is equal to `cw` (thus also `False`), and `i` is `0`. These variables do not affect the execution of the print statement, which simply outputs the string 'Bob'.
