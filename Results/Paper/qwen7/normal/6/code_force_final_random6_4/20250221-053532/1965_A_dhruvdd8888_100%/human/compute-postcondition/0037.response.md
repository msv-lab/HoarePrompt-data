Output State: **`cw` is a boolean flag, `nw` equals `cw`, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. This does not change the values of `cw` or `i`, and `nw` now holds the same value as `cw`. The initial conditions for `cw`, `nw`, and `i` remain unchanged.
