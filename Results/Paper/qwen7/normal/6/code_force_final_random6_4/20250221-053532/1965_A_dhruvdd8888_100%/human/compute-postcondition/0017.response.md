Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `nums`; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; each element in `nums` has been reduced by its corresponding cumulative `ls` value starting from the first iteration; `nw` is set to True; `cw` is True.**

Explanation: The line `cw = True` sets the variable `cw` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `ls`, `nums`, and `nw` remain unchanged.
