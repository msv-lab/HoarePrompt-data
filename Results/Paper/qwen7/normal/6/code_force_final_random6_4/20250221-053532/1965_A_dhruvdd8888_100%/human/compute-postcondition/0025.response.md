Output State: **`cw` is a boolean flag; if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, then `cw` is set to False, otherwise `cw` is set to True; `nw` is equal to `cw`.**

The code `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. Since `cw` is defined as a boolean flag based on the condition of `nums[i]`, `nw` now holds the same value as `cw`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
