The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It first sorts the list and adjusts its elements based on a cumulative sum. Then, it iterates through the modified list to determine a boolean flag `cw`. Based on the final value of `cw`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob". The function does not return any value but modifies and processes the input data as described.
