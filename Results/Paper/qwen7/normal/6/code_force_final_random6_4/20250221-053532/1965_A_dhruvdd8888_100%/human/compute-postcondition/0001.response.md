Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a set containing elements from the input split into strings**.

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts that list into a set. Since the input is not specified, the exact elements of the set `nums` cannot be determined, but it is known that `nums` is a set containing elements from the input split into strings. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
