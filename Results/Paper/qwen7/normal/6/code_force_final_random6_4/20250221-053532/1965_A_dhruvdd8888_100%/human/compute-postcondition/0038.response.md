Output State: `cw` is a boolean flag, `nw` equals `cw`, `i` is `0`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be decremented to `0`. Since the loop does not change the values of `cw` or `nw` beyond setting them based on the current value of `nums[i]`, and since the loop condition ensures `i` reaches `0`, `cw` and `nw` will retain their final values determined by the last iteration where `i` was `1`. At that point, `cw` and `nw` are set based on whether `nums[1]` is `1` or not.
