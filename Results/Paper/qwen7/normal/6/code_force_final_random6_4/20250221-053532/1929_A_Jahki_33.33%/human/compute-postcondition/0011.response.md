Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `num2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `num2 - 1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `num2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `order` is `1`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `num2` must be greater than `1`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will continue as long as `i < num2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `order` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but no such information is provided.
   - `i` will be `3` in the next iteration.
   - `num2` must still be greater than `1` for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`order` is 1, `i` is 3, `num2` must be greater than 1**
