Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the maximum beauty of the array. The function should not be called at all since it doesn't affect the logic for calculating the maximum beauty.

2. **Incorrect calculation of beauty**: The program sorts the array `b` and then calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging elements to maximize the beauty. The correct approach is to place the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end, and then alternate placing the next smallest and largest elements in between.

3. **Unnecessary function call**: The call to `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed entirely.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    
    # Sort the array to get the smallest and largest elements ready
    b = sorted(a)
    
    # Calculate the maximum beauty
    beauty = 0
    if num2 % 2 == 0:
        for x in range(num2 // 2):
            beauty += b[num2 - 1 - x] - b[x]
    else:
        beauty += b[num2 // 2]  # Middle element does not contribute to difference
        for x in range(num2 // 2):
            beauty += b[num2 - 1 - x] - b[x]
    
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements and then arranging them to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
