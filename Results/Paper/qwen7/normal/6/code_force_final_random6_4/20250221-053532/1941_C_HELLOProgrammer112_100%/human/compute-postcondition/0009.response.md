Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, and `s` is updated to the new input string.**

The code `s = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged with their respective values from the initial state.
