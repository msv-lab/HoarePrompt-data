Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie". However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Overcounting**: The program counts "mapie" separately but does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapie", both "map" and "pie" are present, but they overlap at "pie". The current logic would incorrectly add these counts without considering the overlap.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The formula `x + y - z` is not correct for determining the minimum deletions needed to make the string beautiful. The counts of "map" and "pie" should be adjusted to exclude the parts that are already covered by "mapie".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify and remove the minimum number of characters such that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. This can be achieved by scanning through the string and keeping track of whether "map" or "pie" is found. If either is found, we mark the characters in the string as needing removal.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
