The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string `s`. It then prints the result of `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
