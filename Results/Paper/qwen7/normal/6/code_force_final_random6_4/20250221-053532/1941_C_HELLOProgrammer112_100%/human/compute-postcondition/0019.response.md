Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the updated `s`, `s` is updated to the input string from the user, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the updated `s`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` to the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
