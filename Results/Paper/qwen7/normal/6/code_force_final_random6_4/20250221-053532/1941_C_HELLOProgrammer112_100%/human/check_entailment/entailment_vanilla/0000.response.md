Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`.
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie".

3. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the result using the formula `x + y - z`, where:
     - `x` is the count of "map".
     - `y` is the count of "pie".
     - `z` is the count of "mapie".

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated value for each test case.

### Correctness Check

To determine if this approach is correct, let's consider the logic behind it:

- The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions needed to remove either "map" or "pie" from the string.
- The formula `x + y - z` is intended to account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". Specifically:
  - `x` counts all occurrences of "map".
  - `y` counts all occurrences of "pie".
  - `z` counts occurrences of "mapie", which are counted twice in `x` and `y`. By subtracting `z`, we avoid double-counting these overlaps.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Overlapping Substrings**:
   - The formula `x + y - z` assumes that every occurrence of "mapie" is counted exactly once in both `x` and `y`. This is not always true. For example, if "mapie" appears in the string, it should only be counted once, but the current formula might count it multiple times.

2. **Handling Overlaps**:
   - The formula does not handle more complex overlaps correctly. For instance, if "map" and "pie" overlap in a way that is not covered by "mapie", the formula will not correctly account for these overlaps.

### Example Counterexample

Consider the string "mapmap". 
- `x` (count of "map") = 2
- `y` (count of "pie") = 0
- `z` (count of "mapie") = 0

Using the formula `x + y - z` gives `2 + 0 - 0 = 2`, which suggests deleting 2 characters. However, the correct answer is 1 because deleting one "m" from the first "map" would make the string "mapap" (which is beautiful).

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues with handling overlapping substrings and complex overlaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
