Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `z = s.count('mapie')` counts the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `z`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
