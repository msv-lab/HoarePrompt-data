Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s', `s` is updated to the input string from the user, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`.**

This means that the variable `y` is now set to the count of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` that was just input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
