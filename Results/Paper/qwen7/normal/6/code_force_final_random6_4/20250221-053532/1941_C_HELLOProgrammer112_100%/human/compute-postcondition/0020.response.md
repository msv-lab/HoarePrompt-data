Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\). This means \(2 \leq t \leq 10001\), but this value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `a` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `s` is an input string from the user.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the updated `s`.
- `s` is updated to the input string from the user.
- `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the updated `s`.

The print statement `print(x + y - z)` will output the result of adding the number of occurrences of 'map' (`x`) and 'pie' (`y`) in the string `s` and then subtracting the number of occurrences of 'mapie' (`z`) in the string `s`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map', y is the number of occurrences of 'pie', and z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the string s)**
