Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

The expression `print(x + y - z)` calculates the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, and then subtracts the number of occurrences of 'mapie'.

To determine the exact output, we need to consider the following:

- If 'map' appears in `s`, `x` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence.
- If 'pie' appears in `s`, `y` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence.
- If 'mapie' appears in `s`, `z` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence.

The expression `x + y - z` will count the total number of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences while subtracting the double-counted 'mapie' occurrences.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in terms of the counts of these substrings in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map', y is the number of occurrences of 'pie', and z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the string s)**
