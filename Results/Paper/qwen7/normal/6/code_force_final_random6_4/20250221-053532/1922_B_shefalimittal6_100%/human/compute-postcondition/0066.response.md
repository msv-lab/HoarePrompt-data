Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it must still be greater than 0 for the next iteration.
   - `idx` is increased by 1, so if `idx` was previously `i`, now it is `i + 1`.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1, so if `v[x]` was previously `val`, now it is `val + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is now `i + 1`.
   - `v[x]` is now `val + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1**
