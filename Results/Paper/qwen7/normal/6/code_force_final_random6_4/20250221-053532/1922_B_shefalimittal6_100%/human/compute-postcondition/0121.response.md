Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1 again, `v[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` (which is an integer) to the variable `x`. The initial state indicates that `idx` is increased by 1 and `v[x]` is increased by 1. After executing the code, `idx` is increased by 1 again, `v[x]` is increased by 1, and `x` now holds the value of `data[idx]`, which is an integer.
