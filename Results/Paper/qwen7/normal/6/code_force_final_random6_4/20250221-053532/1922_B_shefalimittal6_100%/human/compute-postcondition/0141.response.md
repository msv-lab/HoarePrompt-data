Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 2, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `n` is `idx - 1`, and `cnt` is `v[0]`, after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented to 2. The values of `n` and `cnt` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated by the specified calculation.
