Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1 again; `v[x]` is increased by 1 again; `x` is an integer from `data[idx]` and `idx` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since `x` is an integer from `data[idx]` and `idx` is increased by 1 again, the only change is that `v[x]` is increased by 1 again. The other conditions remain the same.
