Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[4]`, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is 5, and `n` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `cnt` is increased by `v[4]`. Since the condition for changing `ans` is based on the value of `v[4]` being greater than or equal to 3, and since the value of `v[4]` is not specified to be less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 to become 5, and `n` remains unchanged at 5.
