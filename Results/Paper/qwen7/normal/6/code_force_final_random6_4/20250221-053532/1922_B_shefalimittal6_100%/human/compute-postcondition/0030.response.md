Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. The value of `i` remains 0 as no operation changes its value. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and the condition that the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 is still valid.
