Postcondition: `cnt` and `ans` are integers. If `v[4]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[4] * (v[4] - 1) // 2`, `cnt` is increased by `v[3]` if `v[3]` is less than 3; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 4, and `n` is 5. If `v[4]` is less than 2, no changes are made to `cnt` and `ans`.
