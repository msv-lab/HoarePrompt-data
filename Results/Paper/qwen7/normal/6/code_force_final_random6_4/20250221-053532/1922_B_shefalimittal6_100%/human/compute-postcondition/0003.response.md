Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from stdin, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `idx` is 1, and `a` remains unchanged as a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` (where `idx` is 0) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is implicitly incremented by 1 due to the nature of list indexing in Python, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
