Output State: **`x` is the next integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1 (now `idx` is increased by 1 again), `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `idx` is increased by 1 again.**

This means that `idx` has been increased by 1 twice, and `v[x]` has been incremented by 1. The value of `x` remains the same as it was in the initial state, and `idx` is now one more than it was initially.
