Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The key variables here are `n` and `_`. However, since `_` is typically an underscore (a placeholder variable) used when the loop variable is not needed, it does not affect the state directly. Therefore, the only relevant variable from the loop head is `n`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 0. Since `n` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, and no operation within the loop body affects `n`, `n` remains greater than 0 unless explicitly changed inside the loop body, which is not mentioned.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1, so if `idx` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it becomes `i + 1`.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1, so if `v[x]` was `value` at the end of the previous iteration, it becomes `value + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is increased by 1**
