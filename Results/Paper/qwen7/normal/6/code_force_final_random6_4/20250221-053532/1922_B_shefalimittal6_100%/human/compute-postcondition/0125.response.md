Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed; `idx` is equal to `n + 1`; `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of its index value appearing in `data`; `t` must still be greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will have been incremented `n` times starting from 0, making it equal to `n + 1`. The list `v` will contain the counts of each integer value from `data` that was encountered, with the count corresponding to the integer's position in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 as per the initial conditions.
