Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, and additionally increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` if `v[i]` is currently greater than or equal to 3; `cnt` is incremented by `v[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The conditions for updating `ans` based on the value of `v[i]` remain the same as well.
