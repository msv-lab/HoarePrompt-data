Postcondition: `i` is updated to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` where `v[i]` is the current value of `v[i]` which is at least 3, and `cnt` is updated to the next value of `v`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, then `i` is updated to 2 without changing `ans` and `cnt`.
