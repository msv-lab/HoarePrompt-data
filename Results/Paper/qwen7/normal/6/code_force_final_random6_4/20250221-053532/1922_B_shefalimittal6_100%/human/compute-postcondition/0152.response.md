Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0] + v[2]`, `ans` is increased by `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2` if `v[3] >= 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, this expression becomes `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`. The other variables (`n`, `cnt`, and the condition for `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
