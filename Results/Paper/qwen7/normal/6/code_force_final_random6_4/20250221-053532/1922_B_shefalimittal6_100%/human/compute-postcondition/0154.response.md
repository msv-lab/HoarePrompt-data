Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0] + v[2]`, and `ans` is increased by `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6` and `cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2` if `v[3] >= 2`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, the variable `i` remains 3, `n` is still `idx - 1`, `cnt` remains as `v[0] + v[2]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6` and `cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2` if `v[3]` is greater than or equal to 2. If `v[3]` is less than 2, only the first term is added to `ans`.
