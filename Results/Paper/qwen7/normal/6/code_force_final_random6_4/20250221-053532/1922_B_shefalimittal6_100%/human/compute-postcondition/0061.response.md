Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `data` is unchanged, `results` contains a single string which is the str representation of `ans`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` up to the `n`-th element, and `t` is decreased by 1; `v` is now a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `idx`, `data`, `results`, `i`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and only `v` is updated to be a list of zeros with the specified length.
