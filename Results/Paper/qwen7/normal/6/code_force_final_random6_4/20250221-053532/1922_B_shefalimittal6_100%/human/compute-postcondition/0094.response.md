Output State: **`cnt` and `ans` are integers; `ans` is increased by `v[4] * (v[4] - 1) * (v[4] - 2) // 6`; `cnt` remains unchanged; `i` is 4; `n` is 5.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` is executed under the condition that `v[4]` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `i` is 4, the expression inside the `+=` operator evaluates to `v[4] * (v[4] - 1) * (v[4] - 2) // 6`. This value is added to `ans`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged because the condition for changing `cnt` (`v[3] < 3` or `v[3] >= 3`) is not specified in this snippet. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as well.
