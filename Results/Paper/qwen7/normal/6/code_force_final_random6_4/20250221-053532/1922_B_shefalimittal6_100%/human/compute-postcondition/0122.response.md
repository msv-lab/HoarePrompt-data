Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1 again, `v[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is an integer from `data[idx]` and `idx` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increases the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables (`v[x]` and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx` is increased by 1 again, `v[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`, and `idx` is increased by 1.
