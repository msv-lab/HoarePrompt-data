Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the accumulated result from the loop's operations on `v`, and `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(str(ans))` appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `cnt`, or `ans`, but it adds an element to the `results` list. Therefore, the updated state includes the new list `results` with the string representation of `ans`.
