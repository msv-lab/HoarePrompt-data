Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of non-negative integers \( a \) (of size \( n \)). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the frequency of elements in the list \( a \) and stores the result as a string in a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each result separated by a newline.**
