Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `cnt` is updated to be `v[0]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial or postcondition states.
