Output State: **`results` contains a single string which is the str representation of `ans`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`, and `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` up to the `n`-th element.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(str(ans))` appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. This means `results` now contains one element, which is the string form of `ans`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their final values after the loop completed.
