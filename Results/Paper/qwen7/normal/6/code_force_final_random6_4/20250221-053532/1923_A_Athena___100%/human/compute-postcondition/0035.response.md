Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a non-negative integer.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the original input integer.
- `a` is an empty list.

The print statement is `print(res)`. Since the value of `res` is explicitly stated as a non-negative integer, we will use that value directly in the output.

Output: **res (where res is a non-negative integer)**
