Output State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain the element 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` must contain at least one element which is 0, after executing `a.pop()`, the element 0 will no longer be in the list `a`. The values of `res` and `_` remain unchanged.
