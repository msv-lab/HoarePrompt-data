Output State: **`res` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 0, after executing this line, `res` becomes 1. The values of `_`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
