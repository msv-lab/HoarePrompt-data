Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`. The relevant variables here are `a` and `a[0]`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `res` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must not be empty (`a` should be non-empty) and the first element of `a` must be 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `a` is non-empty and `a[0] == 0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` must be non-empty and the first element of `a` must be 0**
