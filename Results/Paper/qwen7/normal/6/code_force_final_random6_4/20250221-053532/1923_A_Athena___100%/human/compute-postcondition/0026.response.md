Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `res` is 1
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a list containing at least one element
   - The current value of `a[i]` is 0

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `a` contains at least one element, `len(a)` is at least 1.
   - If `i` is currently 0 (since `a[i]` was 0), then the next value of `i` would be 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `a`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[1]` is 0.**
