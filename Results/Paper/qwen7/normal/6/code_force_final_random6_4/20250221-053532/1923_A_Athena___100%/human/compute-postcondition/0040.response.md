Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
2. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).
3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `res` is 0.
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't affect the loop execution).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must not be empty (`a`), and the first element of `a` must be 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

Given the current state:
- `res` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `_` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is an input integer (not directly affecting the loop condition).
- `a` is a list of integers (we need to ensure `a` is not empty and `a[0] == 0`).

Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a string and converting elements to integers, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element and that the first element is 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `a` must not be empty and the first element of `a` must be 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` must not be empty and the first element of `a` must be 0**
