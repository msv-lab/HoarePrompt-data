Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be completely emptied of all its elements, each time removing the first element if it is 0. Since the loop condition checks the last element (`a[-1]`) to decide whether to continue, once all non-zero elements are removed and the list becomes empty, the loop terminates. The variables `res` and `_` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution as they are not referenced within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is 2, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is 3, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[2]` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
