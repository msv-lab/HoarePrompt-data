Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `i` must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. All other variables (`res`, `i`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
