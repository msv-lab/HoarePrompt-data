Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, and it iterates `t` times.
2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `_` is less than `t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is a non-negative integer.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is the original input integer.
   - `a` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is used as the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - `res`, `n`, and `a` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `_` is 1 (since it was 0 at the end of the previous iteration and is incremented by 1).
- `t` remains the same.
- `res`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`res` is a non-negative integer, `_` is 1, `n` is the original input integer, `a` is an empty list**
