Output State: **`res` is 0; `a` does not end with 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state where `a` ends with 0, after executing this line, `a` no longer ends with 0. The value of `res` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.
