Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as the list `a` is not empty and the last element of `a` is 0.

2. **Current State:**
   - `res` is 0.
   - `a` is either empty or its last element is no longer 0.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a and a[-1] == 0` must be true. This means:
   - `a` should not be empty (i.e., `a` must contain at least one element).
   - The last element of `a` must be 0.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `a` is either empty or its last element is no longer 0, we need to change the state such that `a` is not empty and its last element is 0.
   - We don't need to change `res` because it is not part of the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that it is not empty and its last element is 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`res` is 0, `a` is not empty and its last element is 0**
