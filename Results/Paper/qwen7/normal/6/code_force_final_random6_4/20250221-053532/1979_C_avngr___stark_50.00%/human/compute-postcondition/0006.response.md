Output State: **`hcf` is updated to gcd(`hcf`, the third element of the list `numbers`)**

Explanation: The code `hcf = gcd(hcf, num)` updates the variable `hcf` to the greatest common divisor of its current value and the value of `num`. Given that `num` will be updated to the third element of the list `numbers` at the start of the next iteration, `hcf` will now be the greatest common divisor of its previous value and the third element of the list `numbers`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
