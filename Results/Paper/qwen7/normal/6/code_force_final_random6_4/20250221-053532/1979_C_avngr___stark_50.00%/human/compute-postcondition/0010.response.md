Output State: The greatest common factor (`hcf`) of all the elements in the list `numbers`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of `hcf` and each subsequent element in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
