Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is an even integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the absolute difference between the original `n` and `m`. Since `n` is 0, `k` is simply the value of `m`.
- The absolute difference `k` is not a power of 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
