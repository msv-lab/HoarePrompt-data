Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the binary string representation of the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and assigns this length to the variable `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
