Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer entered by the user
   - `m` is the second integer entered by the user
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix)
   - `p` is the length of `l`
   - `q` is 2
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`
   - `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, then `q` remains 2. Otherwise, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < int(input())`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i_end + 2`.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same as it is the number of iterations specified by the user.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` is now `i_end + 2`.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k`.
   - `p` is the length of `l`.
   - `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\).

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer entered by the user
   - `m` is the second integer entered by the user
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix)
   - `p` is the length of `l`
   - `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\)
   - `i` is `i_end + 2`
   - `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `i` is `i_end + 2`**.
