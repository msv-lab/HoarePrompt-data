Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between the original `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2, `i` is `i_end + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `t`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
