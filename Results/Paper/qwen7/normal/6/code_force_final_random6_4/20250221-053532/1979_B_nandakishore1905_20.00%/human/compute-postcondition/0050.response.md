Postcondition: **`k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `q` is set to 2. Otherwise, `q` is set to \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**
