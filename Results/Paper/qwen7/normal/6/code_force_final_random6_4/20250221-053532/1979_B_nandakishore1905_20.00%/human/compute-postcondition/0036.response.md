Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is either 2 or \(2^{(p - 1)}\) depending on whether `n == 0` and `m % 2 == 0` is true or false, and `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
