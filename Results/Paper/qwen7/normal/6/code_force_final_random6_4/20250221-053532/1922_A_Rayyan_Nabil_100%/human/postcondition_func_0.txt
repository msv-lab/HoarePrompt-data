The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 20), `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters), `b` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters), and `c` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters). It checks each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` to see if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such index exists after checking all indices, it returns 'NO'.
