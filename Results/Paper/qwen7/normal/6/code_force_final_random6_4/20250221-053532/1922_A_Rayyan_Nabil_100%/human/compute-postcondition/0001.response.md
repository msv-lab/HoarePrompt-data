Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, results is an empty list, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged**.

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
