The only objects in the loop head are variables `result`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since `result` is the only variable directly involved in the loop's condition and iteration, we need to focus on it. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but might be modified within the loop body.

Given that the loop iterates over `results`, the state of `results` and `result` will change as the loop progresses. At the end of the previous iteration, `result` has been processed, and the loop will move to the next element in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element left to iterate over. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` still has elements to process.

State: **`results` is a list that can be iterated over and has at least one more element, `n` is initialized, `a` is initialized, `b` is initialized, `c` is initialized**
