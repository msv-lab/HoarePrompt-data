Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is an input string that has been stripped, `n` is the integer value of the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
