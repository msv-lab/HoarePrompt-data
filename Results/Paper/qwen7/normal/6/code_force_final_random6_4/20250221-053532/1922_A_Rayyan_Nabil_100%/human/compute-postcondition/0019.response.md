Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string from user input, `c` is the stripped input string from the current line of code, `c` is an input string that has been stripped, and the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` has been called and its result has been appended to the list `results`.**

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with the arguments `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and its result has been added to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `results` now contains one additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
