Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string from user input, `c` is the stripped input string from the current line of code, `c` is an input string that has been stripped.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes a new input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
