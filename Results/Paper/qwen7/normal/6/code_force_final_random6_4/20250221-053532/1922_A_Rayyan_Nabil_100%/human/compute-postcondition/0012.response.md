Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is an input string that has been stripped.**

The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
