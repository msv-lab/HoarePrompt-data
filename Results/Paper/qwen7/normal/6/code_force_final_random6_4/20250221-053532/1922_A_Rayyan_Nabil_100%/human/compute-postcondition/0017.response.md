Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string from user input, `c` is an input string that has been stripped, `n` is the integer value of the stripped input string `a`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `b` has been updated to the new stripped input string from user input, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
