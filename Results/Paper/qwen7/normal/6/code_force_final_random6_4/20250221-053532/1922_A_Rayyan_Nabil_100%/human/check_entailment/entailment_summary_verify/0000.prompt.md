You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls another function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. It collects the results of these function calls into a list and prints each result. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the list `results` contains the outputs of `func_1` for each test case, while the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are left in their final states from the last test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for each position `i`, the characters in `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a valid template exists according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- String `a`: `aa`
- String `b`: `bb`
- String `c`: `ab`

According to the problem description, we need to find a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not. In this case, a valid template could be `"AA"` or `"BB"`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `'NO'` because there is no position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to check if there exists a character in `a` or `b` that matches the corresponding character in `c` and ensure that the other string does not match the same character in the same position. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i] == c[i] and b[i] != c[i]) or (b[i] == c[i] and a[i] != c[i]):
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This corrected function ensures that either `a` or `b` matches the template while `c` does not, which aligns with the problem description.
