Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, results is an empty list, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is an input string that has been stripped.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string from user input, `c` is the stripped input string from the current line of code, `c` is an input string that has been stripped, and the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` has been called and its result has been appended to the list `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
