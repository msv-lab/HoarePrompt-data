Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if there exists any position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists. A valid template must ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if for every character position, either both `a` and `b` have the same character (which should be used in the template) or one of them has a different character than `c` (which ensures `c` does not match). Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i].islower() and b[i].islower()) and a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
            continue
        elif (a[i].isupper() and b[i].isupper()) and a[i].lower() != b[i].lower() and a[i].lower() == c[i]:
            continue
        else:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to process the input
func_2()
```

This solution checks each character position to ensure that the conditions for a valid template are met. If any position fails these conditions, it returns "NO". If all positions meet the conditions, it returns "YES".
