Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, along with strings a, b, and c of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns different outputs based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any direct parameters when called but works with a predefined structure of inputs (t, n, a, b, c) and returns outputs based on specific conditions related to these inputs.
