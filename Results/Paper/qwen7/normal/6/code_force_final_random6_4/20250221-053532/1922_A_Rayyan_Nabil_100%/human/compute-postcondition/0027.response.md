Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list that can be iterated over and has at least two more elements.
- `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized but their specific values are not provided.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list because `result` is not defined elsewhere in the snippet and would default to the first element of the list if it were to be accessed directly.

Output: **the first element of the results list**
