Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last stripped input string, `b` is the second last stripped input string, and `c` is the last stripped input string.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 0 and no operation inside the loop changes it). The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values of the last inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.
