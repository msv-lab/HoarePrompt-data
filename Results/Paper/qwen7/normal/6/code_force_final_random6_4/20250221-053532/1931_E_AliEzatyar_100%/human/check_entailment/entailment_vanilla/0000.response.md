Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads the list of integers.

2. **Calculating Total Digits and Zeros:**
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - It counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using the function `func_1`.

3. **Processing Trailing Zeros:**
   - It sorts the list of zeros in descending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted list of zeros in steps of 2, summing up every second element (starting from the largest).

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the sum of zeros is at least `m + 1`.
   - If true, it sets the answer to 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
- This is used to identify numbers that can be manipulated to reduce the total number of digits effectively.

#### Logic Implementation
- The core logic is to determine if Sasha can force a win by reducing the total number of digits enough to ensure the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).
- The key insight is that Anna can reduce the number of digits by reversing digits, while Sasha can increase the number of digits by concatenation.
- The program correctly counts the number of trailing zeros and uses them to determine if Sasha can force a win.

### Verification
- The logic for counting trailing zeros and the condition to determine the winner are correctly implemented.
- The sorting and summation of zeros are done correctly.
- The final check to determine the winner based on the difference between total digits and sum of zeros is also correct.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
