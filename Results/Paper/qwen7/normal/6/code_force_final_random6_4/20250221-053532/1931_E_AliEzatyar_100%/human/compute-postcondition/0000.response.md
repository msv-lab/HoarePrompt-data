Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes `counter` to 0. The value of `num` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `num` still holds its initial condition of being an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
