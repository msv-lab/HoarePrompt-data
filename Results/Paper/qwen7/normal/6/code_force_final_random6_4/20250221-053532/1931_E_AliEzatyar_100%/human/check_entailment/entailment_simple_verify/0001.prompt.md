You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `m` for each case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the list of integers as strings.
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list (`total_digits`).
   - It calls `func_1` for each string to count trailing zeros and stores the counts in the `zeros` list.
   - It sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It processes the sorted `zeros` list in pairs to sum every other element starting from the largest, accumulating in `subtract_zero`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is at least `m + 1`.
   - If true, it assigns 'Sasha' to the corresponding position in `answers`.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'Anna'.

4. **Helper Function `func_1`:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates backward through the string until it encounters a non-zero digit.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Counting Trailing Zeros:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts trailing zeros, which is necessary for the logic to work.

2. **Summing Every Other Largest Trailing Zero Count:**
   - The program sums every other largest trailing zero count, starting from the largest. This part seems to be intended to simulate the game's strategic moves but may not fully capture the game's logic.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is used to determine the winner. However, this condition does not fully reflect the game's rules. Specifically:
     - Anna's moves involve reversing digits, which changes the length of the numbers but not necessarily their sum.
     - Sasha's moves involve concatenating numbers, which can significantly increase the resulting number's length.
     - The condition should consider the maximum possible length of the final number after all moves, not just the sum of trailing zeros.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the problem statement. The condition used to decide the winner is not aligned with the game's rules, and the processing of the list and the helper function do not fully capture the strategic aspects of the game.
