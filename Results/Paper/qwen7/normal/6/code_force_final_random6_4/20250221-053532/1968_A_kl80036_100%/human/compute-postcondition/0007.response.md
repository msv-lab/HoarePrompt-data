Output: **x - 1 (where x is the initial input integer)**

Explanation:
- Initially, `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`, so `y` is one less than the value of `x`.
- The `print(y)` statement simply outputs the value of `y`.
- Since `y` is directly derived from `x`, the output is `x - 1`.
