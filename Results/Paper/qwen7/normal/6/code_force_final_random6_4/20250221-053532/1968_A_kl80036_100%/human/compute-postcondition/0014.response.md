Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `x`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The function does not return any value directly but implies it might handle or process these integers within its body.**

Note: Since the function definition itself does not specify the return type or behavior, the description focuses on the constraints and expected input parameters.
