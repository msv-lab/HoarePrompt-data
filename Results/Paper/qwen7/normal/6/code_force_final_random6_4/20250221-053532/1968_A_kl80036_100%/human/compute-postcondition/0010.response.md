Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is `previous_i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `y = x - 1` simply reassigns the value of `y` to be `x - 1`. The value of `x` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the original values of `x` and `i`, while updating `y` to be `x - 1`.
