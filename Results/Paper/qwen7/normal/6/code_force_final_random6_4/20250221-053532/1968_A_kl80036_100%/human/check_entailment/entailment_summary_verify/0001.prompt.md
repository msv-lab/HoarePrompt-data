You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of integer inputs. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of subsequent integer inputs. For each of these `t` inputs, it calculates and prints the value of the input integer decreased by one. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but ensures that for each input `x`, the value `x - 1` is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The program should output any valid \( y \) for each test case.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( x \).
   - It sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - It prints \( y \).

3. **Checking the Solution**:
   - Let's consider some examples to see if this logic works correctly:
     - If \( x = 10 \):
       - \( y = 9 \)
       - \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\)
     - If \( x = 7 \):
       - \( y = 6 \)
       - \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\)
     - If \( x = 21 \):
       - \( y = 20 \)
       - \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\)

4. **General Case Analysis**:
   - For any \( x \), setting \( y = x - 1 \) ensures that \( y < x \).
   - Since \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) (because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime), the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) simplifies to \(1 + (x - 1) = x\).
   - This value \( x \) is indeed the maximum possible value since \(\gcd(x, y)\) can be at most 1, and adding \( y \) (which is \( x - 1 \)) gives \( x \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program always outputs \( x - 1 \) for each test case.
   - This \( y \) satisfies the condition \( 1 \le y < x \).
   - The value \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized to \( x \), which is the highest possible value under the given constraints.
