Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by user input. However, since we are given constraints on `t` (which is equivalent to `int(input())` in this context), we know that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the specified range. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())`, ensuring it falls within the valid range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
