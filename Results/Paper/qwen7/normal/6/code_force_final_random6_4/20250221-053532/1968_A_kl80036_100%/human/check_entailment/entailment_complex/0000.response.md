Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for each test case.
- The provided code simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case. This approach does not consider the condition \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), which needs to be maximized.
- For any \( x \), the value \( y = x - 1 \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For example, if \( x = 10 \):
  - \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\)
  - \(\gcd(10, 8) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\)
  - \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\)
  - \(\gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\)
  - \(\gcd(10, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\)
  - \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\)
  - \(\gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\)

  Here, \( y = 5 \) gives the maximum value of \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).

- The code does not check for the condition \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) and instead always uses \( y = x - 1 \), which may not maximize the expression.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
