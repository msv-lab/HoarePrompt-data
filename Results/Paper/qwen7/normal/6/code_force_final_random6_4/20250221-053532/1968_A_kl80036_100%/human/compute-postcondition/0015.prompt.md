You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all input cases, meaning `i` is now equal to the total number of inputs provided. For each iteration, `x` was an input integer, and `y` was calculated as `x - 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be the sum of all inputs minus the number of inputs (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each input). `x` will hold the value of the last input provided, and `y` will be the last input value minus one.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be the total number of inputs, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `x`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The function does not return any value directly but implies it might handle or process these integers within its body.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
