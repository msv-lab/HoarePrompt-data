Output State: **`x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified beyond the fact that `x` is now an integer resulting from user input.
