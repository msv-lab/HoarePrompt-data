Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is `x - 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have been incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the input value used to determine the range.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` would be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The input value used to determine the range remains the same unless it changes within the loop body, but since it is not specified to change, we assume it stays the same.

5. **Calculating the New Values:**
   - Let's denote the input value as `new_input_value`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `previous_i`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - The input value `new_input_value` is the value of `int(input())` for the next iteration, which we don't know yet but needs to be determined.

6. **Final State:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `y` is still `x - 1`.
   - `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - `new_input_value` must be such that the loop can continue, i.e., `new_input_value` should be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 1`.

Given this reasoning, the final state before the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `new_input_value` must be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 1`**.
