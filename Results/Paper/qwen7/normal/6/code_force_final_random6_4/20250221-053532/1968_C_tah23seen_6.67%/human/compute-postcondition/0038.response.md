Postcondition: **`i` is the last index of `arr`; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; for each `ans[j]` where `j` ranges from 2 to `i + 1`, the value is doubled until it is no longer less than or equal to `arr[j]`, and finally `ans[i + 1]` is the last value that satisfies the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, which is equal to the previous value of `ans[i]`.**
