Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is the length of `arr` - 1.
- `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i`.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(n - 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 3` (inclusive). This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 3`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: Since `i` is the length of `arr` - 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine what `i` was before this iteration.
   - If `i` is the length of `arr` - 1, then the previous value of `i` would be `length_of_arr - 2`.
3. **Range of the Loop**: The loop runs until `i` is less than `n - 2`. Therefore, the loop will run as long as `i < n - 2`.

### Determining the New State
- **New Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `length_of_arr - 2`.
- **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Given that `i` is now `length_of_arr - 2`, the condition `length_of_arr - 2 < n - 2` must hold true.
- **Postcondition Update**: After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `length_of_arr - 1`. The postcondition will update accordingly.

### Updated State
- `i` will be `length_of_arr - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `length_of_arr - 2`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is length_of_arr - 2, and `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to length_of_arr - 2**.
