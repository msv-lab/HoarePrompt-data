Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements, each initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `arr` still holds its original list of n-1 integers, and `n` retains its original value within the specified range.
