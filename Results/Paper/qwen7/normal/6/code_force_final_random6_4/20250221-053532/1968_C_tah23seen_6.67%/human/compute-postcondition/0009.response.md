Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`, `ans[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[2]`, `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1] + ans[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[2]`. Since `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]` and `ans[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[2]`, the updated value of `ans[2]` becomes `ans[1] + ans[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
