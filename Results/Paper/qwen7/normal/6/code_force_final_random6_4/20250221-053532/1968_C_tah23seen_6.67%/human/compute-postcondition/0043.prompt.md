You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n. The variable n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be -1, and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` will be the final value of `ans` which is the maximum possible value that can be achieved by doubling the values according to the given conditions.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is `ans[length_of_arr - 2] + arr[length_of_arr - 1]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` containing n-1 integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is obtained by adding `arr[length_of_arr - 1]` to `ans[length_of_arr - 2]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is `ans[length_of_arr - 2] + arr[length_of_arr - 1]`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
