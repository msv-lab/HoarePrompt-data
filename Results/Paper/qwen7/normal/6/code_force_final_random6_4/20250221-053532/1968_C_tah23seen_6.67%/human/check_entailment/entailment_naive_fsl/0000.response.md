Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  2 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  An array `a` such that:
  - `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`
  - `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`
  - `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`

- **Actual Output:**
  The program generates:
  ```
  3 5 4 9
  ```

  Let's verify if this output satisfies the conditions:
  - `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 5 \bmod 3 = 2` (Correct)
  - `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \bmod 5 = 4` (Incorrect, should be 4 \bmod 5 = 4, but the condition is satisfied)
  - `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 9 \bmod 4 = 1` (Correct)

While the last two conditions are satisfied, the second condition is not strictly following the modulo operation as required. A more appropriate approach would be to ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `2 \le i \le n`.

A correct solution would involve choosing `a_i` such that `a_i = x_i + k * a_{i-1}` for some integer `k`, ensuring the modulo condition is met. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
