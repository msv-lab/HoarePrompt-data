Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `b + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 2
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`
   - `b` is at least 1
   - `i` is `int(info[1]) + 2`
   - `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`
   - If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `b + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `b`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `b + 1`.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains 2.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` remains at least 1.
   - `i` becomes `b + 1`.
   - `x` and `suma` are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is incremented by 1.**
