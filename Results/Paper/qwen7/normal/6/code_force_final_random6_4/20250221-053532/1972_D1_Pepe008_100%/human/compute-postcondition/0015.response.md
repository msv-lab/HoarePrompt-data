Postcondition: `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `x` + 1, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i**2 == 0)` and `i * (i - 1) % i**2 == 0`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains 0, `a` remains as the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` remains at least 1, `suma` is incremented by 1 and equals `x + 1`, where `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Additionally, `x` must satisfy the conditions `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i**2 == 0)` and `i * (i - 1) % i**2 == 0`. Since there is no else part, these conditions apply unconditionally when the if condition is met.
