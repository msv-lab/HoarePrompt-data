Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The value of `T` remains unchanged, and `t` is still 0.
