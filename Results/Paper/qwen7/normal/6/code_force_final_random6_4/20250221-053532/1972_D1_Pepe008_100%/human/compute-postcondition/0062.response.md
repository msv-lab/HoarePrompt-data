Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2) + 1`, `suma` is `suma` + `x`**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2) + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its current value.
