Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

Explanation: The line `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Since `x` is calculated from the values of `a` and `i`, and these values remain unchanged, `suma` now includes the new value of `x`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and the condition on `suma`) remain in their initial states.
