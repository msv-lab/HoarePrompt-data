Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 2`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
