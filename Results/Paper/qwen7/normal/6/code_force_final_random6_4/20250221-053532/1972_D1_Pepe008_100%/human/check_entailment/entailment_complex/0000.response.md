Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` for each `i` in the range `[1, b]`. This condition is not relevant to the problem statement. The problem requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula used to calculate `x` is also incorrect. The program uses `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, which does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **GCD Not Used**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` is not computed or used in the calculations, which is crucial for determining the valid pairs.

4. **Incorrect Final Output**: The final output is `suma - 2`, which does not reflect the correct logic required by the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
