Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is undefined, `suma` is the sum calculated over all iterations of the loop including the previous one, `info` is updated with the new input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` takes user input, splits it into a list based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `suma` remain unchanged from their initial states.
