Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `xor` and the current element `i` from `cur_arr`. The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, `thing1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `xor` now holds the cumulative XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.
