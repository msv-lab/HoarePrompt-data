Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements; xor is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`; `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xor` (which is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`) to `new_arr`. Since `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, and `xor` is their XOR, `new_arr` now contains this `xor` value as its first element. The initial conditions about `cur_arr` and the definition of `xor` remain unchanged.
