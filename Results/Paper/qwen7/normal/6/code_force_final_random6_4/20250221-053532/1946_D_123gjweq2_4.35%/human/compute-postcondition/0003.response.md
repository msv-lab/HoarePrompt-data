Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, and `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit); `new_arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `new_arr` as an empty list. The values of `cur_arr` and `bit` remain unchanged from their initial state.
