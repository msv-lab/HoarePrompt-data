Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements; `xor` is 0; `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0.**

Explanation: Initially, `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`. After setting `xor = 0`, `xor` is explicitly set to 0. Since `new_arr` was previously defined as a list containing the value of `xor`, it now contains the value 0. The precondition that `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements remains unchanged.
