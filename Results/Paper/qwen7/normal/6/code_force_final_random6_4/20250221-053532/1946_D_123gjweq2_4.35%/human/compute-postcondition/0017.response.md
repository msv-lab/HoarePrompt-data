Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element; `xor` is 0; `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `xor` to 0. Since `xor` was previously the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, setting it to 0 means that the cumulative XOR operation has been reset. Consequently, `new_arr`, which contains the value of `xor`, now contains the value 0.
