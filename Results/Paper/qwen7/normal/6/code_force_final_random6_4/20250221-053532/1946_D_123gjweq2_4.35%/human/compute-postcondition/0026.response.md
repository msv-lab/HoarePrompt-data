Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and the current value of `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 1.**
