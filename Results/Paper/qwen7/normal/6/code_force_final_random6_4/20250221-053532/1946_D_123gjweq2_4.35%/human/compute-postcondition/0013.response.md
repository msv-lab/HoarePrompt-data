Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, `xor` is 0, and the current value of `xor` does not have the `bit`-th bit set to 1.
