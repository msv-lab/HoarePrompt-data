Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, and the current value of `xor` does not have the `bit`-th bit set to 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` and the current value of `xor` does not have the `bit`-th bit set to 1, `new_arr` now contains this value of `xor`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
