Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is supposed to return the maximum value from the list `arr`. However, the problem requires finding the maximum number `k` such that certain conditions are met, not just the maximum value in the list.
- The function `func_1` is simply returning the result of `find_max(arr, 31)`, which means it is trying to find the maximum value in the list. This is not aligned with the problem requirements.

### Analysis of `find_max`:
- The function `find_max` is designed to recursively process the list based on the bit position.
- It checks if the current XOR of the elements up to the current index, when shifted right by `bit` and ANDed with 1, is zero. If it is, it appends the current XOR to `new_arr`.
- If the current XOR, when shifted right by `bit` and ANDed with 1, is non-zero, it sets `thing1` to -1.
- It then recursively calls itself with the reduced bit position.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value between the result of the recursive call with the previous bit position and the length of `new_arr`, or -1 if `thing1` is -1.

### Correctness Check:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
- The function `find_max` seems to be attempting to split the array into segments based on the bit positions and check the condition for each segment.
- However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly calling `find_max` with `arr` and `31`, which is not the intended logic for solving the problem.

Given the above analysis, the functions do not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, `func_1` is not providing the correct functionality, and `find_max` is not being called with the appropriate parameters to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
