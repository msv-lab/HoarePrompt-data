Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, and `thing1` is 0. The value of `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 results in 0.
