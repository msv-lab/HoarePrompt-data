Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the result of calling `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` since the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1.**
