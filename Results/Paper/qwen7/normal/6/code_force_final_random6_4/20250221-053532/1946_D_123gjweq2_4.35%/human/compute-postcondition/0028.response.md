Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `new_arr` will contain the cumulative result of the XOR operation on all elements of `cur_arr` considering each bit position from `bit` down to 1.
