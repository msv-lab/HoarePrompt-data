Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Functions:
testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers, and x is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30.
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 31)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'arr' considering 31 bits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer. It returns the maximum value from the list. The returned value is considered within a 31-bit range, though the actual comparison is done using the full bit representation of the integers in the list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit).
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit). The value of bit is not -1.
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `new_arr` will contain the cumulative result of the XOR operation on all elements of `cur_arr` considering each bit position from `bit` down to 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is either -1 or the result of calling `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 or 0.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input. It processes the list based on the specified bit position and returns one of three values: the length of the list `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the result of a recursive call with the previous bit position and the length of a new list, or -1.
