    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))

    else :

        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input. It processes the list based on the specified bit position and returns one of three values: the length of the list `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the result of a recursive call with the previous bit position and the length of a new list, or -1.
