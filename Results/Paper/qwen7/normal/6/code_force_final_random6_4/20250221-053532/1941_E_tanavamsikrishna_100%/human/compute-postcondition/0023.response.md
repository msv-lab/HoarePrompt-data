Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(d, len(row))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `d`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `min_heap` contains the element `(row[i], i)`.
   - `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `[d, len(row))`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last value it took before the loop condition failed (i.e., `i` was the largest value such that `i < len(row)`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The condition `i < len(row)` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The variable `d` remains unchanged as it is the starting point of the loop and does not change within the loop.
- The `min_heap` and the updated value of `row[i]` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration because these are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`min_heap` contains the element `(row[i], i)`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `d` is unchanged**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can represent it as `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Final Answer:
State: **`min_heap` contains the element `(row[i], i)`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `d` is unchanged**.
