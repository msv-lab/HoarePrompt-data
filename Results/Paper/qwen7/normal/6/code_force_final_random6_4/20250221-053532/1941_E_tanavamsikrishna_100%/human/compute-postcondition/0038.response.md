Output State: **`i` must be `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.**

Explanation: The `pass` statement does not perform any operation or assignment, so the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values specified in the initial state are still valid after executing the code.
