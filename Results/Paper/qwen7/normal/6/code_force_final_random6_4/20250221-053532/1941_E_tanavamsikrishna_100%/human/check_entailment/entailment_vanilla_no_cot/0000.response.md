Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of building bridges with the specified constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row of the river.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports within the constraint of a maximum distance `d`.
   - The function correctly handles the initialization of the first few elements of the row and then iterates through the rest of the row, maintaining the heap to ensure that the distance constraint is respected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for a test case, which includes the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of each cell in the river.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports in that row.
   - Finally, it computes the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by considering all possible starting points for the bridges and taking the minimum of these costs.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly solves the problem as described.
