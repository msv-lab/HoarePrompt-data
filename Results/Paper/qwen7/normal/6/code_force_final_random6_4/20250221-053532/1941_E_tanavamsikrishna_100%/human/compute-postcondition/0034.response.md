Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `d`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` is executed, adding `(row[i], i)` to `min_heap`.
   - The loop continues to execute as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be greater than or equal to `d + 3` and the loop terminates when no further elements in `min_heap` satisfy the condition `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d - 2)`.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since the loop continues to execute as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, we need to ensure that the next element popped from `min_heap` still satisfies this condition.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is such that it is just about to exceed the condition for termination (`i >= d + 3`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration would then be checked with `heappop(min_heap)[1]` being compared to `(i + 1) - (d + 2)`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the next iteration should be checked with the updated value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the loop continues as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**.

Given that `i` was previously `i` and now it needs to be `i + 1`, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the loop continues as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**.

However, since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, let's denote it as `i_prev` for clarity:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the loop continues as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i_prev + 1 - (d + 2)`**.

Simplifying the condition:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the loop continues as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the loop continues as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`**.
