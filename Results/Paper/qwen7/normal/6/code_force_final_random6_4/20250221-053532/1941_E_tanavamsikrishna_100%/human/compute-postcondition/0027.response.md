Output State: **`i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3` and `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**

This means that after the code is executed, the variable `i` must be set to a value that satisfies the condition `i >= d + 3`, and the value of `heappop(min_heap)[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. The other conditions and the nature of the heap remain unchanged.
