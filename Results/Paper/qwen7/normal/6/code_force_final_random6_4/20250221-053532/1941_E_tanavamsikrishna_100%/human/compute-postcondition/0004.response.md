Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0. This is because `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))` generates a sequence starting from 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and the value of `len(costs) - (k - 1)` should be such that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Initial State of `costs`**: The list `costs` is given as a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.

5. **Initial State of `rows`**: The list `rows` is given as a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once. This means that `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 0, and `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k - 1`**.
