Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every k consecutive elements from `costs`.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k` - 1.
   - `total_costs` is updated by appending the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must remain unchanged because it is determined by the length of `costs` and the value of `k`, which are unchanged.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `total_costs` remains unchanged.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k` - 1.
   - `total_costs` is updated by appending the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every k consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k` - 1, and `total_costs` is updated by appending the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from `costs`**.
