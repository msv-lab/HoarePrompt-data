Output State: `i` must be `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have incremented by 3 from its initial value (`i_prev`), while `d` remains unchanged. The condition for continuing the loop (popping from `min_heap`) requires that the value at index `[1]` from the popped element must still satisfy the inequality `<= i_prev - d - 1`.
