Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`; `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `row[i]` to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. Since `i` was initially `i_prev + 3`, it remains `i_prev + 3` after the update. The value of `d` remains unchanged. The condition for popping from `min_heap` still holds, meaning the value at index `[1]` from the popped element must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.
