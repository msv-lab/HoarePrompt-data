Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the original value of `h` minus 12, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `day` to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
