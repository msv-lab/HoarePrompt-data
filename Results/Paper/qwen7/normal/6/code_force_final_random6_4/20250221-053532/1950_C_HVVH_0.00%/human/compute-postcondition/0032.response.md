Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `day` from 'PM' to 'AM'. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `h`, and `m`) remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
