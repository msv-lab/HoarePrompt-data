Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'; `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes user input in the form of a string separated by a colon (':'), splits the string into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `h` and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `day`, `n`) remain unchanged.
