Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input after each iteration. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12 or less, `day` remains 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it is adjusted to 0.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1440, `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` will be the original input integer which must be at least 3 since the loop runs at least 3 times, and `h` and `m` will be the final values entered by the user after all iterations of the loop. The logic inside the loop ensures that `h` is always adjusted to a valid 12-hour clock format and `day` is correctly set based on the value of `h`.
