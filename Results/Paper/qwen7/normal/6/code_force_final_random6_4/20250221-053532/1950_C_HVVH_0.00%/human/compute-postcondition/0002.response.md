Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `_` (a placeholder variable), `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
   - `day` is 'AM'.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is the input integer. The loop itself does not modify `t` or `day`, but it does depend on `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs for `n` iterations. The values of `t` and `day` do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
