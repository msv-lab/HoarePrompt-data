Functionality: **The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. It iterates `n` times, where `n` is provided as input, and adjusts the hour values accordingly. After processing, it prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" for each input time.**
