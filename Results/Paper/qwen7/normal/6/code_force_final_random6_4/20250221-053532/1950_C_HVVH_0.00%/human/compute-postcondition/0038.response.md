Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, the value of `day` remains unchanged.
