Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, the value of `day` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible values for `h` and `m` and how they affect the output:

- `h` and `m` are derived from the input split by ':'.
- The format `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that both `h` and `m` are zero-padded to two digits.
- The value of `day` is determined based on the value of `h`.

Since the exact input values for `h` and `m` are not specified, we need to consider the general case where `h` and `m` are valid time components.

### General Case:
- If `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive, it will remain unchanged, and `day` will be 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the original input.
- If `h` is 12, `day` will be 'AM'.
- If `h` is between 13 and 23 inclusive, `h` will be adjusted by subtracting 12, and `day` will be 'PM'.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1**: `h = 9`, `m = 30`
   - `h` is between 1 and 11, so it remains 9.
   - `day` could be 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the original input.
   - Output: `09:30 AM` or `09:30 PM`.

2. **Scenario 2**: `h = 12`, `m = 45`
   - `h` is 12, so `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Output: `12:45 AM`.

3. **Scenario 3**: `h = 15`, `m = 15`
   - `h` is 15, so it is adjusted to 3 (15 - 12).
   - `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Output: `03:15 PM`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the time in the format `HH:MM` with leading zeros and the corresponding `day` ('AM' or 'PM') based on the rules described.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}**
