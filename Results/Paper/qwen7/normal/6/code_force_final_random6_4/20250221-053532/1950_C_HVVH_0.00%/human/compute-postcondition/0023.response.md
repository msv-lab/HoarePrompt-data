Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is either 12 or an input integer (not equal to 0), and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12, `day` becomes 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` becomes 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.
