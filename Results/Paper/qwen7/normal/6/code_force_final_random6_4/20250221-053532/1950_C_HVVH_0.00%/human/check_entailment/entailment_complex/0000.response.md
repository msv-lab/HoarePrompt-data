Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, the function splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format is mostly correct but contains some redundancy and unnecessary complexity:
   - If `h` is 0, it should be set to 12 and `day` should be set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it should be adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` should be set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, it should remain 12 and `day` should be set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `day` should be set to 'PM'.
4. However, the current implementation sets `day` to 'PM' for all cases where `h` is not 0, and then checks if `h` is 12 to adjust it. This is redundant and can be simplified.
5. The final print statement correctly formats the output as "hh:mm AM/PM".

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

However, the original function can be simplified to:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {"AM" if h < 12 else "PM"}')
```

This simplified version avoids unnecessary checks and directly sets `day` based on the value of `h`.

Given the original function's logic and the provided example, the function appears to work correctly for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
