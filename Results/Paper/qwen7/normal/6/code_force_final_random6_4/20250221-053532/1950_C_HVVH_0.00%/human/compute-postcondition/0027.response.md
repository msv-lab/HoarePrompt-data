Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**.

Explanation: The code sets the value of `h` to 12, which overrides the previously obtained value of `h` from the input split by ':'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
