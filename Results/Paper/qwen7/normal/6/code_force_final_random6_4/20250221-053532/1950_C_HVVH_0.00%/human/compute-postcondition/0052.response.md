Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12 or less, `day` remains 'AM', and if `h` is exactly 12, it is adjusted to 0.
