Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It correctly identifies whether the time should be in the morning ('AM') or afternoon ('PM').
- The logic for converting hours is mostly correct but has a minor flaw. Specifically, when `h` is 0, it should be set to 12 and the day should be 'AM', but the logic for setting `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12 is redundant and incorrect.
- The program uses `f-string` formatting to ensure that the hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits, which is correct.
- The program iterates over the input `n` times, which is correct based on the problem statement.

However, there is a logical error in the code:
- When `h` is 0, it should be set to 12 and `day` should be set to 'AM'.
- The condition `if h == 12: day = 'AM'` is unnecessary and incorrect because it sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, which should be 'PM'.

Here is the corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

Despite this issue, the provided solution would still work correctly for most cases due to the redundancy in the original code. However, it is not strictly following the optimal logic.

Correctness: **False**
