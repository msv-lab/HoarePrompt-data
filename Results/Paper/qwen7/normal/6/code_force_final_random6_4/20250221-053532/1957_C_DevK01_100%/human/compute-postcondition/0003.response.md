Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp` is an empty list.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2 and `dp` is a list containing one element which is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (2 - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10)`. However, the code snippet removes the first element from the list using `dp.pop(0)`, making `dp` an empty list. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
