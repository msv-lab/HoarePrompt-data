Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already made `k`. It also correctly reads the coordinates of the moves made by the user and the corresponding mirrored moves by the computer.

2. **Adjusting the Board Size**: The program correctly adjusts the board size `n` by subtracting 2 for each unique move (when `a != b`) and subtracting 1 for each mirrored move (when `a == b`). This adjustment ensures that the board size reflects the remaining unoccupied positions after the initial moves.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the board. It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board without them attacking each other. The recurrence relation used in the function is correct for calculating the number of configurations for a given `n`.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The function correctly applies the modulo operation with \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct in terms of logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
