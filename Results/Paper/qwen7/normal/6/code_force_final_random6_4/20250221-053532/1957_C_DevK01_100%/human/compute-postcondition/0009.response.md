Output State: **`i` is 4, `dp` is `[]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**

Explanation: The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. Initially, `dp` is `[18]`. After executing the code, `dp` becomes an empty list `[]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 is still valid.
