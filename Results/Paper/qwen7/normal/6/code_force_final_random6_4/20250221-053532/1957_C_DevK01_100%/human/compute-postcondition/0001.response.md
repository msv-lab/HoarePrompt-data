Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`, but since the loop starts at `2`, the initial value of `i` should be `2`.

2. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `i` starts at `2`, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `2` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`dp`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be `2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2**
