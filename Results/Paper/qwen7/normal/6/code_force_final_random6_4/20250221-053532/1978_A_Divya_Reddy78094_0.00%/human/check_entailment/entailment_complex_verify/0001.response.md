### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice needs to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the largest book in each pile is maximized.
   - The optimal strategy is to place the two largest books in different piles to maximize the sum of the largest books in each pile.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.
   - It sorts the list of page counts in descending order (`reverse=True`).
   - It then prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the two largest books.

3. **Verification**:
   - Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest books are at the beginning of the list.
   - However, the code only considers the sum of the first two elements, which might not always give the maximum possible sum of the largest book in each pile. This is because the two largest books could be placed in the same pile if they are the only two books, and no other books are considered.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `2\n2 3`
     - The sorted list is `[3, 2]`.
     - The code prints `3 + 2 = 5`.
     - However, the optimal division would be to put the book with 3 pages in one pile and the book with 2 pages in the other pile, resulting in a sum of `3 + 2 = 5`, but this is not a counterexample since the current approach is already correct for this specific case.
   - Consider the input: `2\n10 3`
     - The sorted list is `[10, 3]`.
     - The code prints `10 + 3 = 13`.
     - This is the correct output, as the two largest books are in different piles.
   - Consider the input: `3\n2 2 3`
     - The sorted list is `[3, 2, 2]`.
     - The code prints `3 + 2 = 5`.
     - However, the optimal division would be to put the book with 3 pages in one pile and the two books with 2 pages in the other pile, resulting in a sum of `3 + 2 = 5`, but the current approach is still correct for this specific case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code correctly identifies the two largest books and sums them, which is indeed the optimal solution for the given problem. There is no scenario where sorting and taking the sum of the first two elements would fail to produce the maximum possible sum of the largest book in each pile.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It finds the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by placing the two largest books in different piles.
