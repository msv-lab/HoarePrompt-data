Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` and the placeholder `_`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any state, we only need to consider `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of sorted integers in descending order.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 2 (since it was at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of sorted integers in descending order**.
