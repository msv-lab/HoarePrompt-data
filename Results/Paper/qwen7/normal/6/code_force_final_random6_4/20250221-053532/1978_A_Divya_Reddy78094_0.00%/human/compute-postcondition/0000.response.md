Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; `n` is an unknown integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and the code does not provide further input for `t`, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer. The variable `n` is not defined yet and remains unknown.
