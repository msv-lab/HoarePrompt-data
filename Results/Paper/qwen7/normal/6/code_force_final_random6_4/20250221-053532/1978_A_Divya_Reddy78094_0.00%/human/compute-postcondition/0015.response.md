Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 2, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified and does not affect the print statement.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

The print statement `print(nums[0] + nums[1])` will print the sum of the first two elements of the list `nums`.

Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest element and `nums[1]` is the second largest element in the list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest element and nums[1] is the second largest element in the list nums)**
