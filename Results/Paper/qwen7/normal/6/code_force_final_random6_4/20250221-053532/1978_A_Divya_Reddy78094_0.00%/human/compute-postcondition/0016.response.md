Output State: `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

Explanation: The loop runs exactly 3 times as per the given information. After the loop completes its 3 iterations, the value of `t` remains 3 because the loop's condition `in range(t)` means `t` is decremented with each iteration but starts from 3 and doesn't go below 3. The variable `n` takes on different values each iteration based on user input, and `nums` is updated to a sorted list of integers in descending order for each input `n`.
