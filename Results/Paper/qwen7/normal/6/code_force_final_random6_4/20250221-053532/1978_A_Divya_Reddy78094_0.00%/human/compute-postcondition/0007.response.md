Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of sorted integers in descending order, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variables `t` and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` must still be at least 2, `n` is now an integer obtained from user input, and `nums` remains a list of sorted integers in descending order.
