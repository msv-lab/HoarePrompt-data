### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Alice needs to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the largest book in each pile is maximized.
   - To achieve this, the optimal strategy is to place the two largest books in different piles.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.
   - It sorts the list of page counts in descending order (`reverse=True`).
   - It then prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the two largest books.

3. **Verification**:
   - Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest books are at the beginning of the list.
   - Taking the sum of the first two elements gives the maximum possible sum of the largest book in each pile.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It finds the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by placing the two largest books in different piles.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
