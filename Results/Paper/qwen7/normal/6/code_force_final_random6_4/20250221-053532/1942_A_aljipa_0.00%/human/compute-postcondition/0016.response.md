Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \), where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 \). For each test case, it generates a list `res` based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \): if \( k \) equals \( n \), it creates a list of \( n \) ones; if \( k \) equals 1, it creates a list of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \); otherwise, it creates a list containing only -1. The function prints the list `res` for each test case and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final state where the loop counter `t` is reduced to 0.**
