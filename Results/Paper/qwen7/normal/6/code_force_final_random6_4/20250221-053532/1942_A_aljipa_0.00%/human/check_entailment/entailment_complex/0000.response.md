Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a\) with specific properties regarding its cyclic shifts.
2. The provided solution attempts to generate a list `res` based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\):
   - If \(k = n\), it generates a list of \(n\) ones.
   - If \(k = 1\), it generates a list of integers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - Otherwise, it generates a list containing only -1.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - If \(k = n\), the array can be all ones, and all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
   - If \(k = 1\), the array can be a strictly increasing sequence, and only one cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - If neither condition is met, no valid array exists, so -1 is returned.
4. However, the solution does not correctly handle the requirement that exactly \(k\) out of \(n\) cyclic shifts must be sorted. It only checks for the conditions \(k = n\) and \(k = 1\), but does not ensure that exactly \(k\) cyclic shifts are sorted for other values of \(k\).

Given this analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to generate an array with exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
