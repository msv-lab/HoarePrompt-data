State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, so `t` must also be less than or equal to 10^3.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted as they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3.
