Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating arrays based on the conditions specified for \(k\) relative to \(n\). However, there are several issues with the logic and the constraints handling:

1. **Array Generation Logic**:
   - If \(k = n\), the program correctly generates a list of \(n\) ones.
   - If \(k = 1\), the program generates a list of integers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - If neither condition is met, it incorrectly generates a list containing only -1.

2. **Handling of Constraints**:
   - The problem requires finding an array where exactly \(k\) out of \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted. The current logic does not ensure this constraint is met.
   - For \(k = n\), the solution is correct because every cyclic shift of an array of identical elements is sorted.
   - For \(k = 1\), the solution is also correct because only one specific cyclic shift (when the smallest element is at the beginning) will be sorted.
   - For other values of \(k\), the current logic does not provide a valid solution.

3. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - To meet the requirement of exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts, we need to construct an array where only \(k\) specific cyclic shifts are sorted. This typically involves creating a pattern that ensures exactly \(k\) shifts are in non-decreasing order.

Given these points, the current implementation does not fully address the problem requirements for all cases, particularly when \(k \neq n\) and \(k \neq 1\).

Correctness: **False**
