Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is now `t - 1 - 1`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input using `input().split()`. This does not change the value of `res` or `t` directly, but it updates `t` to `t - 1`. The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `k` is either `n` or `1`, in which case it would be updated accordingly. Since the values of `n` and `k` are not provided, `res` retains its initial state based on the conditions given, and `t` is now `t - 2` because `t` was decremented twice.
