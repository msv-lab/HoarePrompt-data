Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k` equals `n`, then `res` is `[1] * n`, meaning `res` is a list with `n` elements, each being `1`.
     - If `k` equals `1`, then `res` is `range(n)`, meaning `res` is a range object from `0` to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`, meaning `res` is a list containing a single element `-1`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a single line: `print(*res)`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the list or range object into individual arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Determining the Value of `res`:**
   - Since the value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider all three cases:
     - Case 1: If `k == n`, then `res` is `[1] * n`.
     - Case 2: If `k == 1`, then `res` is `range(n)`.
     - Case 3: If `k != n` and `k != 1`, then `res` is `[-1]`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - In the first two cases, `res` is a list, and the `print(*res)` will print each element of the list separated by spaces.
   - In the third case, `res` is a list with a single element `-1`, so the output will be `-1`.

Given that the exact value of `k` is not provided, we need to consider the most general case where `k` does not equal `n` or `1`, which means `res` is `[-1]`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
