Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It initializes `s` to 1 and iterates `x` times, updating `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula is designed to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over a series of wins and losses, where each win multiplies his bet by `k-1` and each loss reduces his bet by the full amount.
4. After the loop, the function checks if `a` (Sasha's initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s` (the calculated sum). If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, it prints "Yes", indicating that Sasha can achieve the goal. Otherwise, it prints "No".
5. The logic in the loop and the final comparison are correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the analysis, the annotated program accurately reflects the intended behavior and logic of the function.

Correctness: **True**
