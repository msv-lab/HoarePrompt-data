Output State: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`. After all iterations, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is `x + 2`, and `s` is the sum of its initial value plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` and `x` retain their final values as determined by the loop's conditions, `i` is set to `x + 2` (as it was incremented outside the loop), and `s` has been updated through the loop to include the sum of `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - 1`.
