Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Sasha needs to ensure he can eventually have any number of coins \( n \).
   - The program should check if Sasha can achieve this goal given the constraints \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates \( x \) times, updating \( s \) in each iteration.
   - \( s \) starts at 1 and is updated by adding \( s // (k - 1) + 1 \) in each iteration.
   - This logic seems to be calculating how much Sasha can potentially gain after \( x \) consecutive wins, considering the multiplier \( k \).

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The formula \( s = 1 \) and \( s += s // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x \) iterations should correctly simulate the growth of Sasha's coins.
   - The condition `if a >= s` checks if Sasha initially has enough coins to start this process.

4. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - For the first test case (2 1 7):
     - \( s \) starts at 1 and updates as follows:
       - Iteration 1: \( s = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
       - Iteration 2: \( s = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
     - Since \( a = 7 \) and \( s = 3 \), the condition `a >= s` is true, so the output is 'Yes'.
   - For the second test case (2 1 1):
     - \( s \) starts at 1 and updates as follows:
       - Iteration 1: \( s = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
     - Since \( a = 1 \) and \( s = 2 \), the condition `a >= s` is false, so the output is 'No'.

5. **General Validation**:
   - The logic correctly simulates the growth of Sasha's coins and checks if it meets the initial condition.
   - The program handles all test cases as per the provided examples.

Based on the analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct outputs for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
