Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value of input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value of input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining space-separated values of input.**

Explanation: The code reads multiple space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The first integer is assigned to `n`, the second to `k`, and the rest form the list `a`. The variables `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
