Output State: **`can_survive` remains unchanged, `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`, and `bullets_used` is increased by `health`.**

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` increases the value of `bullets_used` by the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial postcondition. Therefore, `bullets_used` is updated to be `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`. The other variables (`can_survive`, `monsters`, `distance`, and `total_bullets_needed`) remain as specified in the initial postcondition.
