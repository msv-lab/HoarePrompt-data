Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list, `monsters` is an empty list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the last monster's position, `total_bullets_needed` is the final `bullets_used` value, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The other variables (`can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `monsters`, `distance`, `total_bullets_needed`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
