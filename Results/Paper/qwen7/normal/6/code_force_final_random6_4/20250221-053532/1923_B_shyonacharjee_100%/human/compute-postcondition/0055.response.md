Postcondition: `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the first and second monsters, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first tuple, `pos` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
