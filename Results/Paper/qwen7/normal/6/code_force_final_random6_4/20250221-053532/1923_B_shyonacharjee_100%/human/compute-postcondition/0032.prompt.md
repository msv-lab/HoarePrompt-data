Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bullets_used` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `can_survive` is True.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value, `monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used` (or `bullets_used + health`), and `can_survive` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `can_survive` remains unchanged, `bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`, and `bullets_used` is increased by `health`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
