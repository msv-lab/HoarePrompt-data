You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all monsters, `monsters` is an empty list, `pos` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `t` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `x` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `can_survive` will remain `False` because the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` was met at some point, causing the loop to break. The value of `bullets_used` will be the sum of the health of all the monsters since `bullets_used` is incremented by the health of each monster in each iteration. The `monsters` list becomes empty as all monsters are processed. The `pos`, `health`, and `distance` variables will hold the values of the last monster's position, health, and absolute position, respectively. The loop counter `t` will be 0 after all iterations are completed, and the lists `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x` will be empty because they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, followed by two lines of integers. For each test case, it sorts a list of monsters based on their positions, calculates the total bullets used to eliminate them, and checks if the total bullets needed exceed the available bullets per position. If any test case fails this check, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs whether all monsters can be eliminated based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the health values `a` and positions `x` of the monsters.
   
2. **Sorting Monsters**: The program sorts the monsters based on their absolute distance from the player's starting position (point 0). This is a good strategy because it ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial for survival.

3. **Calculating Bullets Needed**: For each monster, the program calculates the total number of bullets needed to kill it (`health`) plus the number of bullets already used (`bullets_used`). It checks if this total is greater than the product of the distance to the monster and the number of bullets the player can use per second (`k`). If it is, the player cannot survive, and the loop breaks.

4. **Updating Bullets Used**: The program updates the `bullets_used` count by adding the health of the current monster. This ensures that the total number of bullets used is tracked correctly.

5. **Output**: After processing all monsters, the program prints "YES" if the player can survive and "NO" otherwise.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic implemented in the program is correct. It correctly determines whether the player can survive based on the constraints given.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when the player can't kill a monster in time due to insufficient bullets.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently sorts the monsters and iterates through them, making it suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive the level.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
