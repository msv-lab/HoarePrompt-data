Output State: `can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all the monsters, `monsters` is an empty list, `pos` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster.

Explanation: Since the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` causes `can_survive` to become False and breaks out of the loop on the first iteration, the loop does not continue to process any further monsters. Therefore, `bullets_used` accumulates the health of all the monsters, `monsters` becomes an empty list as all monsters are processed, and `can_survive` remains False. The values of `pos`, `health`, and `distance` will be those of the last monster in the original list.
