Postcondition: **`monsters` is a list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
