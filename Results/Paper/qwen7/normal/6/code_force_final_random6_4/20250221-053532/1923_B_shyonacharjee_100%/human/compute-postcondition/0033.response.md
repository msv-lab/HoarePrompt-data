Based on the initial state provided:

- `can_survive` remains `True`, meaning the player can survive the encounter with all monsters.
- `bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list.
- `monsters` is an empty list, indicating all monsters have been processed.
- `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the last monster's position.
- `total_bullets_needed` is the final value of `bullets_used` after processing all monsters.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
```

Since `can_survive` is `True`, the condition `'YES' if can_survive else 'NO'` evaluates to `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
