Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, `d` is n-3, `u` is equal to `func_1(n-3)`, `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains v and `u`.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the return values of the function `func_1(d)` to the variables `v` and `u`. Since `d` is `n-3`, `u` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n-3)`. Similarly, `v` is assigned the first return value of `func_1(d)`. The sets and lists mentioned (`remaining_vertices`, `path`) remain unchanged except for the inclusion of `u` in `path`.
