Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `d` is defined in the loop head.
   - The range function parameters are `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, which means `d` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `d`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `d = n-1` and decrements by 1 until `d = 0`, the initial value of `d` should be `n-1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `d` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `d` must be initialized to a value such that it can decrement to 0 without going negative.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `d`.
   - The initial value of `d` must be `n-1` to ensure the loop starts correctly.

5. **Consider the Set `remaining_vertices`:**
   - The set `remaining_vertices` is mentioned but not directly involved in the loop head.
   - Its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute based on the given information.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `d`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`d` is `n-1`**
