Output State: **`d` is `n - 3`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended and the value of `v` has been removed from `path`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `v` from the `remaining_vertices` list. Since `v` was previously in `remaining_vertices` and is now removed, its value is no longer part of that list. The other variables (`d`, `u`, and `path`) remain unchanged except for the fact that `v` has been removed from `path`.
