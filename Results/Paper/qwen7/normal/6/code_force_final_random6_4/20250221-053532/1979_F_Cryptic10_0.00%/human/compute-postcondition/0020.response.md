Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `d` is n-2, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is assigned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains `v`.**

Explanation: The line `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` was already defined and is not part of `remaining_vertices`, the value of `v` remains unchanged. The other variables (`remaining_vertices`, `d`, `u`) are not affected by this line of code.
