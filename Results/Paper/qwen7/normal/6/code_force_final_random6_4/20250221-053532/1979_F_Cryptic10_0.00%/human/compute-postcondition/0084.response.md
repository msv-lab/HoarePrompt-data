Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, `d` is `-1`, `n` is still greater than `0`, `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `n`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
