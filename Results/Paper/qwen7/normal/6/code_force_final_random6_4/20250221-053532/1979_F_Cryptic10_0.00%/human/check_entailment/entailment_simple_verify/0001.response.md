### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function sends a query to the judge and returns the results.
- It prints a query `? d` and waits for the judge to respond with two integers `(v, u)` representing the vertex with the minimum degree and the vertex it is not connected to, respectively.
- If `v` is `0`, it means no such vertex exists, and the loop continues.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph.
- It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
- It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are processed (`remaining_vertices` is empty).
- Inside the loop, it iterates over degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0` to find the vertex with the minimum degree and the smallest number among those with the minimum degree.
- If a suitable vertex `v` is found (i.e., `v` is in `remaining_vertices`), it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
- Finally, it prints the path as a sequence of vertices.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the interaction with the judge by printing the query and flushing the output buffer.
   - It correctly processes the response from the judge and returns the values `v` and `u`.

2. **Finding Hamiltonian Path**:
   - The function `func_2` uses a greedy approach to find the Hamiltonian path.
   - It starts from the highest degree and works downwards, ensuring that the vertex selected has the minimum degree and the smallest number among those with the minimum degree.
   - This approach ensures that we always pick the vertex with the lowest degree first, which helps in constructing a path that visits all vertices exactly once.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no suitable vertex is found by continuing the loop.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by removing vertices and their edges, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Specific Points to Validate

- **Greedy Approach**: The approach used in `func_2` is sound and should be able to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph within the allowed number of queries. The greedy strategy of picking the vertex with the minimum degree first ensures that the path is constructed correctly.
- **Removal of Vertices**: The program correctly removes vertices and their edges as needed, ensuring that the remaining graph is updated properly.
- **Path Construction**: The path is constructed by adding vertices in the order they are found, ensuring that each vertex is visited exactly once.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work correctly under the given constraints. The approach used in `func_2` is sound and should be able to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph within the allowed number of queries.
