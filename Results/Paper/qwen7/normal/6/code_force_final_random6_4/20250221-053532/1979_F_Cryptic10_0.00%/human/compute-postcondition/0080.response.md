Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, `d` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `v` equals 0, and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`; `path` now contains `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the other variables. The values of `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `n`, `v`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial states.
