Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.**

The code removes the value `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`, while `d`, `n`, and `path` retain their original values.
