Output State: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `u` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v` and the loop is broken.**

This means that the function `func_1(d)` is called with `d` being `-1`, and it returns two values which are assigned to `v` and `u`. The values of `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `v` and `u` are updated with the values returned by the function call.
