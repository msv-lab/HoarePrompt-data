Output State: **The loop has executed for all iterations (from `d=n-1` down to `d=0`). The final state of `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n that were never added to `path`. The variable `d` is now `-1`. The variable `path` contains a sequence of vertices added during each iteration where the condition `v in remaining_vertices` was met.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `d` will have decremented through all values from `n-1` down to `0`, and the loop will have checked the function `func_1(d)` for each value of `d`. If `v` (the first return value of `func_1(d)`) is found in `remaining_vertices`, it will be added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. The loop continues decrementing `d` until it breaks out, which happens when `v` is added to `path`. If `v` is never found in `remaining_vertices` throughout all iterations, `path` will remain unchanged from its initial state. The final state of `remaining_vertices` will include all integers from 1 to n that were never added to `path`.
