Output State: `remaining_vertices` is empty, `d` is -1, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `path` contains the values of `v` and `u` (in that order) as many times as they were appended during the loop's iterations. This means that the loop has processed all possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to 0, and for each iteration, it either appends `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or continues to the next iteration if `v` equals 0 or is not in `remaining_vertices`.
