Postcondition: `d` is `n - 3`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and the program continues the loop or iteration since the if condition `v == 0` does not change the postcondition when `v` is not 0.
