Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `d` is n-2, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is assigned by `func_1(d)`, and we continue in the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no change in the values of the variables `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, and `u`, and the `continue` statement does not affect these variables, the values remain the same. The only change is that the program continues in the loop or if statement.
