Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `d` is n-1, `v` and `u` are values returned by `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `n-1`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u`. The values of `remaining_vertices` and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `d` is updated to `n-1`.
