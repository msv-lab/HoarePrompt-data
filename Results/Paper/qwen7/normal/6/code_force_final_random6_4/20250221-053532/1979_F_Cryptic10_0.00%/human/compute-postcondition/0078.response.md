Output State: **`remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `v` equals 0, and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`; `path` now contains `v`.**

Explanation: The code `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is already defined and its value is 0, `path` will now include `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
