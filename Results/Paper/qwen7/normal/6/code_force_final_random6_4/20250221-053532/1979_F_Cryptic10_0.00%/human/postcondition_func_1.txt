The function accepts an integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \). It constructs a path by iterating through possible values and adding vertices to the path based on certain conditions. After processing all possible vertices, it prints the path as a sequence of vertices. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the path and ensures that all vertices are included in the path before terminating.
