Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the logic for splitting the digits of an element and inserting them back into the list is flawed. The program attempts to split the digits and insert them but does not properly manage the indices when inserting the digits, leading to incorrect transformations.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The expected output is `YES` because we can transform the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted. However, the program's logic for splitting and inserting digits is incorrect, leading to potential out-of-order elements after the operation. This can be seen in the example where the program fails to correctly sort the array.

To fix this, the program needs to properly manage the insertion of digits and ensure that the array remains in a valid state after each operation.
