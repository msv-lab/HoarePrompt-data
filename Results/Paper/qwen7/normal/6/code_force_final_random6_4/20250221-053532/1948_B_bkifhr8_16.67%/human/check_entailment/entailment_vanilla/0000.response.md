Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each element in the array, starting from the second element (`p`), the program checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, the program splits the previous element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array at the appropriate positions.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - It returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting digits and inserting them back into the array is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the insertion of digits.
   - The current implementation directly modifies the array by popping and inserting elements, but it does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct positions.

2. **Assumption of Immediate Sorting:**
   - The program assumes that after performing the digit-splitting operation, the array will be sorted immediately. However, this is not always true because the relative order of other elements in the array may still be incorrect.

3. **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or negative numbers, which are not specified in the problem but could affect the sorting process.

### Conclusion

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
