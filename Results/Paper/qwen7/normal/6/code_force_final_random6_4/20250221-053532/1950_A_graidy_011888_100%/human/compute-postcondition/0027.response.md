Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input and converted to integers.

The print statement is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement will print the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **PEAK**
