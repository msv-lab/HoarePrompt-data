Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). For each test case, it checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR', if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\) and prints 'PEAK', otherwise it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, it outputs 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions met during the iterations. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
