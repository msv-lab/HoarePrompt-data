Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers obtained from the input, while `t` and `i` retain their original values within the specified range.
