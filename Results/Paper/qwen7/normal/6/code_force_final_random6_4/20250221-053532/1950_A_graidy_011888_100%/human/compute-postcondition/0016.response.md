Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, and either `a < b < c` is true, in which case no changes are made to `a`, `b`, and `c`, or it is not true that `a < b < c`, in which case the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` may change based on the conditions provided in the else part.
