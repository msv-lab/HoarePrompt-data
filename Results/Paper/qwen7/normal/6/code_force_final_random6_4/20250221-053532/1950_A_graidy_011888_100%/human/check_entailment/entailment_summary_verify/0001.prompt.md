You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). For each test case, it checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR', if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\) and prints 'PEAK', otherwise it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, it outputs 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions met during the iterations. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Parsing Test Case Input:**
   - For each test case, it correctly parses the three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Stair Condition:** The condition `a < b < c` is correctly implemented.
- **Peak Condition:** The condition `a < b` and `b > c` is correctly implemented.
- **Neither Condition:** The default case handles all other scenarios correctly by printing 'NONE'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Equal Digits:** The program should handle cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (e.g., `1 1 1`). According to the problem statement, such cases should be classified as 'NONE'.
- **Invalid Inputs:** The problem assumes valid inputs (i.e., digits between 0 and 9), so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs explicitly.

### Testing the Provided Examples:
Let's manually verify the examples given in the problem statement:

1. **Input:** `1 2 3`
   - Output: `STAIR` (Correct)
2. **Input:** `3 2 1`
   - Output: `NONE` (Correct, neither stair nor peak)
3. **Input:** `1 5 3`
   - Output: `PEAK` (Correct)
4. **Input:** `3 4 1`
   - Output: `PEAK` (Correct)
5. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - Output: `NONE` (Correct, neither stair nor peak)
6. **Input:** `4 1 7`
   - Output: `NONE` (Correct, neither stair nor peak)
7. **Input:** `4 5 7`
   - Output: `STAIR` (Correct)

All the given examples are handled correctly by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, based on the problem description.
