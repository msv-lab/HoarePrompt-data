Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
   - Either `a < b < c` is true, in which case no changes are made to `a`, `b`, and `c`, or it is not true that `a < b < c`, in which case the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` may change based on the conditions provided in the else part.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body. Since no such information is given, `n` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is now 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` may have changed based on the conditions provided in the else part of the loop, but their exact values are not specified here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split**.
