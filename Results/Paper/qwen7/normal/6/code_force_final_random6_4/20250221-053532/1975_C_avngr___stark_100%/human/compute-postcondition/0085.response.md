Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is `temp[1]`, `temp` is [a[4], a[5], a[6]] and is sorted, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 4) and ending just before index `i + 3` (which is 7), resulting in `temp` being `[a[4], a[5], a[6]]`. Since the problem does not specify that the elements in `temp` need to be sorted, we assume they are already sorted as per the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
