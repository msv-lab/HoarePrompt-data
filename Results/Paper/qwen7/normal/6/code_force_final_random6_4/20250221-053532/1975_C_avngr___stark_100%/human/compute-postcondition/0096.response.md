Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)). For each test case, the function finds and prints the maximum value among the second smallest values of all possible sublists of three consecutive elements in the list \( a \). If \( n = 2 \), it simply prints the minimum of the two elements.
