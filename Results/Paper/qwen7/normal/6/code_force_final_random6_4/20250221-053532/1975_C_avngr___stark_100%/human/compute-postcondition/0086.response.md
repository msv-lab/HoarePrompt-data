Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is `temp[1]`, `temp` is [a[4], a[5], a[6]], `temp` is sorted, `i` is 4**.

The code `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp`, which is already defined as `[a[4], a[5], a[6]]`. Since sorting does not change the values within the list but only changes their order, the values of `a`, `max`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `temp` is now sorted.
