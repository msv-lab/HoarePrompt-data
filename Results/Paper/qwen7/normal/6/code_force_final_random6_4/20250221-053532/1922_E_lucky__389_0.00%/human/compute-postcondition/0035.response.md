Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 10) to the list `subseq_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `subseq_lens` now contains the element 10.
