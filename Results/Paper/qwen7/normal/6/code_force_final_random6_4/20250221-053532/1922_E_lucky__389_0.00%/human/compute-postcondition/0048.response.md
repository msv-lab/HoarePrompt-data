Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 1022.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1\). Given that `x` remains 1022 and starts with `i` being 0, we need to find out how many times the loop will run until the condition is no longer satisfied. 

Starting with `i = 0`, the loop increments `i` until \(2^{(i+1)} > 1023\):
- For `i = 0`, \(2^{(0+1)} = 2 \leq 1023\), so the loop runs.
- For `i = 1`, \(2^{(1+1)} = 4 \leq 1023\), so the loop runs.
- This continues up to `i = 9`, where \(2^{(9+1)} = 512 \leq 1023\), so the loop runs.
- For `i = 10`, \(2^{(10+1)} = 1024 > 1023\), so the loop does not run anymore.

Thus, the loop runs 10 times, making `i` equal to 10, while `x` remains unchanged at 1022.
