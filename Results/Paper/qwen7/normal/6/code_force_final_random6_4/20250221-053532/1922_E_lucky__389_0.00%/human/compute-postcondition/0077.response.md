Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. The function does not return any specific value based on the given constraints, but it implies that it might perform some operation or validation on `t` and `X` for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each defined by a pair `(t, X)`, but the exact nature of the operations or the return value is not specified in the provided information.
