Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 1022, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from it. Given that `i` is 10, \(2^{10} - 1 = 1023\). So, `x` is updated to `x - 1023`, which results in `x` being 1022. The values of `t` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.
