Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 1022, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10, `mx` is 10.**

Explanation: The code `mx = max(mx, i)` updates `mx` to be the maximum value between `mx` (which is initially undefined, so we assume it is not defined or its value is less than `i`) and `i` (which is 10). Since `i` is 10 and there's no prior definition of `mx`, `mx` is set to 10. The values of `x`, `t`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.
