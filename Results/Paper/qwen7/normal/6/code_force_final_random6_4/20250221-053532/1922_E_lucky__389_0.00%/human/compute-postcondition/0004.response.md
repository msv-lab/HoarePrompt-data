Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `mx` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an input integer - 1 (meaning `x` is some integer minus 1)
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `x` is not equal to 0.
   - Currently, `x` is an input integer - 1, which means `x` could be any integer except 0 (since it is derived from an integer minus 1).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be 0. Since `x` is derived from an integer minus 1, the only way to ensure `x` is not 0 is to ensure that the original integer is not 1. Therefore, `x` itself must not be -1.

Given this reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must not be -1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
