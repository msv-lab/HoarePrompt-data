### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined by the number of ways to choose elements from the array in increasing order.
   - The problem suggests using powers of 2 to construct the array, which corresponds to the binary representation of `X`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x`, which is `X - 1`.
   - It then constructs the list `subseq_lens` to represent the binary representation of `x + 1`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
   - The list `ansv` is constructed based on the values in `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, the length of `ansv` and its elements are printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly converts `x + 1` to its binary representation and constructs the array based on this representation.
   - The array construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The code handles the special case where `x` is 0 by breaking out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2, resulting in an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
   - For larger `X`, the code correctly constructs the array using the binary representation.

5. **Validation:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

6. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each test case, `X` is an integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
   - **Function Call:** The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - **Inner Loop Analysis:**
     - The outer loop runs while `x` is not zero.
     - The inner loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - This process constructs the binary representation of `x + 1` in reverse order.
   - **Array Construction:**
     - `ansv` is constructed based on the binary representation of `x + 1`.
     - The length of `ansv` is derived from the binary representation.
   - **Output:**
     - The length of `ansv` and its elements are printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing the code and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly constructs an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences based on the binary representation of `X`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
