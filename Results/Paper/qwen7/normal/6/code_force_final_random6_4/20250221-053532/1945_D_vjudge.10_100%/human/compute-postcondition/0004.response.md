Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pergunta` is a string with the new minimum value of `min(pergunta, x + a[i])`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, the lengths of `a` and `b` are both equal to `n`, and `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Since `i` is less than `m` and `x` is 0, the value of `pergunta` is updated to `min(pergunta, 0 + a[i])` which simplifies to `min(pergunta, a[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
