Postcondition: `i` is `i_initial - 1`. If `i_initial - 1 < m`, then `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x_initial + a[i_initial - 1]`, and `x` is increased by `min(a[i_initial - 1], b[i_initial - 1])`. If `i_initial - 1` is not within the bounds of the array, `pergunta` retains its original value and `x` is increased by `min(a[i_initial - 1], b[i_initial - 1])`.
