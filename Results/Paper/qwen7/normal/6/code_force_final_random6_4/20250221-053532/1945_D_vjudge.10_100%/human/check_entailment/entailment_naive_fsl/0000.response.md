Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the bribing process and the cost calculation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The variable `x` is used to accumulate the cost of bribing people, but it is not correctly updated based on the bribing rules. The cost of bribing a person at position `i` should include the cost `a[i]` plus the cost of bribing all people between `i` and `m-1`.

2. **Incorrect Minimum Cost Update**: The minimum cost `pergunta` is updated incorrectly. It should consider the cumulative cost of bribing people from the end of the queue towards the start, ensuring that Kirill ends up within the first `m` positions.

Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
2 1
2 3
1 1
```

The expected output for the first test case should be `14`, but the program outputs `13`. This discrepancy arises because the program does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of bribing people.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate the cumulative cost of bribing people and ensure that the minimum cost is updated correctly based on the rules provided in the problem description.
