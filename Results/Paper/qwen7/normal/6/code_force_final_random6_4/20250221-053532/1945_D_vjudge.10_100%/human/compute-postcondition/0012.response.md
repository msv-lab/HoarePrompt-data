Output State: **`i` is an integer, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`; otherwise, `pergunta` retains its original value, and `x` is increased by `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

This means that `x` is increased by the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `i < m`, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the new value of `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged.
