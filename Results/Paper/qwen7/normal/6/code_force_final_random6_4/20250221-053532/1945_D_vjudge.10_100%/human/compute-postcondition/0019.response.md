Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `pergunta` will hold the minimum value of `x + a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`, `a` and `b` will remain as lists of non-negative integers with lengths equal to `n`, `n` and `m` will still be positive integers such that `1 <= m <= n <= 200000`, `x` will be the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1`, `pergunta` will contain the smallest value obtained from `x + a[i]` for all valid `i` (where `i < m`), and `x` will be the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The lists `a` and `b` and the integers `n` and `m` will retain their original values from the initial state.
