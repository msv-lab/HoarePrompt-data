Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively through the edges defined by the inputs during each iteration of the loop, `x` must be greater than 2×10^5 since the loop runs `x-1` times and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is False, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to the final node `y` that was popped from `lst[x]` after the loop executed all its iterations, and `lst[y]` is not empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to the last node `y` that was popped from `lst[x]` after all iterations of the loop, and `lst[y]` is not empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `lst[x]` is an empty list, `s` is `True`, and `x` is set to the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` during the last iteration of the loop. The list `lst[y]` corresponding to the value of `x` is non-empty, where `y` is the value that was popped from `lst[x]` in the previous iteration.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
