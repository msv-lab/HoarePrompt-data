The only variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst[x]`. If `lst[x]` is not empty, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `lst[x]` is not empty. Since the condition `lst[x]` is already true (not empty), no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`lst[x]` is not empty**
