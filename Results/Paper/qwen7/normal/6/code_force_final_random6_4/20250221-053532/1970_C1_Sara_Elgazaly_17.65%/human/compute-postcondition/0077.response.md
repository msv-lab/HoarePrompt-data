Output State: **`lst[x]'` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `lst[y]'` is a non-empty list containing the element that was popped from `lst[x]'`, and `y` is the element that was popped from `lst[x]'`, `x` is now equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The line `x = y` assigns the value of `y` (which is the element popped from `lst[x]`) to `x`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
