Output State: `lst[x]` is an empty list, and `x` is set to the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `y` holds the value of `x` right before `lst[x]` becomes empty.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst[x]` will eventually become an empty list because the loop continues to pop elements from `lst[x]` as long as it is not empty. When `lst[x]` finally becomes empty, the loop terminates. At that point, `x` is set to the value of `y`, which was the last element popped from `lst[x]` before `lst[x]` became empty.
