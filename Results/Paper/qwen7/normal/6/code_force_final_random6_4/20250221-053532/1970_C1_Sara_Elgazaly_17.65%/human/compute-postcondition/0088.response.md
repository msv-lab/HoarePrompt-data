Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on external constraints where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains t integers such that 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. It returns a value based on these constraints.**

This means the function does not take any parameters itself but operates under specific conditions regarding the variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the list of starting nodes. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information, only the constraints on the input values.
