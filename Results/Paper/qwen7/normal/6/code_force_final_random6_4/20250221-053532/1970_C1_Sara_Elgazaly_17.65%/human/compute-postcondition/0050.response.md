Output State: **`s` is False, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping, and `lst[x]` now does not contain its last element.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. The value of `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping, so `x` is now equal to that last element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
