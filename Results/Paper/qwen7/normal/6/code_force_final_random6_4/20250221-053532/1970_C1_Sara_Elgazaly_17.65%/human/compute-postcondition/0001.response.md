Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `y` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict with default value as list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `lst` can be accessed with a key that does not exist yet, and it will automatically create an empty list for that key. None of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
