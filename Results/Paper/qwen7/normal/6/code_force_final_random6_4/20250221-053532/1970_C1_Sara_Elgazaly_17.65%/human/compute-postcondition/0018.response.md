Output State: **`s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively, `x` must be greater than \(2 \times 10^5\), `lst[x]` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` which was popped from the list.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `lst[x]` must not be an empty list ensures that the pop operation is valid.
