Output State: **`s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` contains a list of integers (with one less element), `lst[b]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, and `x` is now equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` simply assigns the value of `y` to `x`. Since `y` is defined as the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, `x` is now directly assigned to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
