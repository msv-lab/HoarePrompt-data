Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` up to `a[l-1]`, `st` is equal to `l`, `end` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` are equal. Each iteration increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. When `l` becomes equal to `r`, the condition `l < r` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `st` will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, and `l` (which is now equal to `r`) will be the index just beyond the last pair of equal elements.
