Output State: **`end` is increased by 7, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer and the first two elements in the list `a` must be equal, `l` is increased by 1, `st` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given that initially `st` was not specified, we assume it started at 1 (since adding 1 to 1 gives 2). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
