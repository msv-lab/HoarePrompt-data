Output State: **`st` is 0, `end` is 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to both `st` and `end`. The initial values of `total`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `total` is still 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is False, and `ans` is determined based on the conditions above. However, the specific values or expressions for these variables are not updated in this step.
