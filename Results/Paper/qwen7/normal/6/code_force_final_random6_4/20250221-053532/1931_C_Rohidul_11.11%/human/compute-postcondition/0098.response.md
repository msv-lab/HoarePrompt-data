Output State: **`l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was originally greater than `l`, and `a[r]` was equal to `a[r - 1]`, these conditions remain true but now `r` is one less than its original value. The value of `l` and `st` are updated to reflect the total number of consecutive identical elements up to the new value of `r-1`.
