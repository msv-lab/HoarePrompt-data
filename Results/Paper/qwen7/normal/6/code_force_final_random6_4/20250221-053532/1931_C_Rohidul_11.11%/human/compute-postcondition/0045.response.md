Output State: **`end` is increased by 6, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `st` and `end` both to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the values of `end` (which was previously increased by 6), `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
