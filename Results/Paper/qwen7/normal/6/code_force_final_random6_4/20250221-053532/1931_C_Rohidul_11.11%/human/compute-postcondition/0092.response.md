Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is increased by 2.
   - `r` must be greater than `l + 1`.
   - `st` is 2 (this state is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop continuation).

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `r`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Since `l` is increased by 2, the new value of `l` will be `l + 2`.
   - The condition `r > l + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `l < r` holds true after the increment.
   - We need to ensure that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` holds true for the loop to continue.

Given the current state where `l` is increased by 2, the new value of `l` is `l + 2`. To satisfy the loop condition `l < r`, `r` must be greater than `l + 2`.

### Final Answer:
The states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`. Specifically, `l` should be `l + 2` and `r` must be greater than `l + 2`.

State: **`l` is increased by 2, `r` must be greater than `l + 2`**
