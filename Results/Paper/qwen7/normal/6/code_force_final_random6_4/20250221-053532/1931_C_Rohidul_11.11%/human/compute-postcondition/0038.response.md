Postcondition: `end` is increased by 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`. If `st` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.
