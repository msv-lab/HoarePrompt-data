Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It calculates and prints the maximum length of a segment within the list \( a \) that does not contain any consecutive identical elements. If the first and last elements of the list are identical, it adjusts the calculation accordingly. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
