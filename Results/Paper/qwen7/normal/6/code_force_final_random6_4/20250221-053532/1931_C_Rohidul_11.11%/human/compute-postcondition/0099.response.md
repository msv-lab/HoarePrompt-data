Output State: **`l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `end` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. All other variables (`l`, `r`, `a[r]`, `st`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
