Output State: **`end` is increased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r - 2`, and `a[r - 1]` must be equal to `a[r - 2]`**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial condition was `r - 1`, the new condition becomes `r - 2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
