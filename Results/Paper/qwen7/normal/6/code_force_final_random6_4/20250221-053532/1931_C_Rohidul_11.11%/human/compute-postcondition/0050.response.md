Output State: **`l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value to `l + 1`. The condition that `r` must be greater than `l` remains valid. The condition that `a[l + 1]` must be equal to `a[l + 2]` also remains valid because the indices have shifted accordingly.
