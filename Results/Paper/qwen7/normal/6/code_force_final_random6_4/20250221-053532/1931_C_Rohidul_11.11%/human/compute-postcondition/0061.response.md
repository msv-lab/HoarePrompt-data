Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 3`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 1**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was previously a value between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive), after decrementing, `r` will now be a value between -1 and `n - 3` (inclusive). However, since `r` must be a valid index in the list `a`, it cannot be -1. Therefore, `r` is now a value between 0 and `n - 3` (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
