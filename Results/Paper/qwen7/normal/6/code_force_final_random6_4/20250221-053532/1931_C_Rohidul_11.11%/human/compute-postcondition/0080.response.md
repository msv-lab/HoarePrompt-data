Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. The condition states that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached.
   - `l` is `n - 2`.
   - `r` is 0.
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is false, implying that the first two elements of `a` are different.
   - `end` is `n - 1`.
   - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `-1`; otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `a[0] != a[-1]` and `-2` otherwise.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(max(0, ans))
   ```

Given the conditions:
- Since `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is false, the first two elements of `a` are different.
- This means `a[0] != a[1]`.
- According to the definition of `ans`, since `a[0] != a[-1]` (because the first and last elements are different), `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.

Therefore, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.

Since `len(a) - 1` is a non-negative number, `max(0, ans)` will simply return `len(a) - 1`.

Output: **len(a) - 1**
