Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r-1`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Therefore, `r` is now one less than its original value, making `l` (which was originally equal to `r`) now equal to `r-1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
