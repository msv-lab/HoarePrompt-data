Output State: **`l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` equals `end + 3`, `ans` is equal to `r - l`, and either `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l` calculates the difference between `r` and `l` and assigns it to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
