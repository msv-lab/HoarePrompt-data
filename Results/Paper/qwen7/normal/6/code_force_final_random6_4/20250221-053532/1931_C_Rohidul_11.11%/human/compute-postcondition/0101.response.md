Output State: **`l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `r` is now equal to `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `end` is increased by 1, and `r` must be greater than `l`**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `r` being decreased by 1 while maintaining the conditions and relationships specified in the initial state.
