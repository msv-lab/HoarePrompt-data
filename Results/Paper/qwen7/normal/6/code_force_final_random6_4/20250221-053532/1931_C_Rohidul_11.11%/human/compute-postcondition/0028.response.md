Output State: **`end` is increased by 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, `a[l]` is equal to `a[r]`, and `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `r - l - 1`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is the last index of the list `a`, and `l` is `r - 3`. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `(r) - (r - 3) - 1`, which simplifies to `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
