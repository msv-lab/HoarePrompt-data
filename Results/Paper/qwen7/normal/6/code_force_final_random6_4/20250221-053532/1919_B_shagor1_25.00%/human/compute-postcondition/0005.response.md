Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `neg` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '-'.**

Explanation: The variable `neg` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
