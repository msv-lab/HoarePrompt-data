Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It calculates the number of '-' characters in `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - It prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

### Expected Solution
To minimize the penalty, we need to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. Given the problem constraints and the example outputs, the optimal strategy seems to be to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. **Counting Negatives**: The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in `neg`.
3. **Calculating Result**:
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the program prints `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the program prints `n`.

### Correctness Check
- **Case 1: All '+' characters**
  - Example: `s = "+++"`
  - `neg = 0`
  - Output: `n - 2 * neg = 3 - 0 = 3`
  - This is incorrect because the optimal split would be `(["+++", "+++"], penalty = 0 + 0 = 0).

- **Case 2: All '-' characters**
  - Example: `s = "-----"`
  - `neg = 5`
  - Output: `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 5 = -5` (which is incorrect)
  - Correct output should be `5` (splitting into single elements).

- **Case 3: Mixed Characters**
  - Example: `s = "+-+-+"`
  - `neg = 3`
  - Output: `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 3 = -1` (which is incorrect)
  - Correct output should be `0` (splitting into ["+", "-", "+", "-", "+"], penalty = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. It simply subtracts twice the count of '-' characters from `n`, which does not always yield the optimal solution.

**Correctness: False**
