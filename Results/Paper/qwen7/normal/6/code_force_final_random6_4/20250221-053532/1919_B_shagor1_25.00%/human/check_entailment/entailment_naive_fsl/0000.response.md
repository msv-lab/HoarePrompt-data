Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the optimal split involves splitting the array into smaller segments that balance positive and negative values to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The correct solution would involve splitting the array into `([-1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, the provided program calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg` which results in `10 - 2 * 8 = 2`, which is incorrect.

The program incorrectly assumes that the entire array can be treated as a single segment or that the optimal strategy is simply to count the number of negative signs. This approach does not account for the possibility of balancing positive and negative values within segments to minimize the overall penalty.
