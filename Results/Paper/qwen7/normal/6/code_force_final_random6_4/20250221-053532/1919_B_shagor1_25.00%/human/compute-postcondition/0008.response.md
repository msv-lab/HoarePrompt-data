Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1
- `neg` is 1 if the character `s[i]` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0

### Loop Head:
```
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- The variable `i` in the loop represents the current character being processed in the string `s`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop is iterating over the string `s`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the loop.
- `s` remains the same as it is the string being iterated over.
- `neg` is updated based on the current character `s[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial State**: `i` is the index of the character that was processed in the previous iteration.
2. **Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).

Given that `s` is a string of length `n`, the loop will continue until `i` reaches the length of `s`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `neg` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `neg` is updated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `neg` is 1 if the character `s[i]` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0.**
