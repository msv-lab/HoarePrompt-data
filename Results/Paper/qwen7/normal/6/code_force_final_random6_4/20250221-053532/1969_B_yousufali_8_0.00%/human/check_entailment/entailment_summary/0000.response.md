Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided code has two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of consecutive '1's, and calculates the sum of all such groups plus one for each group. However, this logic does not align with the problem requirements.
   - `func_2()`: This function processes a specified number of test cases, calling `func_1()` for each test case. The problem specifies that the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), but `func_1()` is not designed to handle the problem correctly.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, `func_1()` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it calculates something else (sum of lengths of groups of consecutive '1's plus one for each group). Therefore, the provided functions do not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
