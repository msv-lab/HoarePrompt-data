### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list of integers as input, which is incorrect because the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string.
   - It attempts to process the input as a list of integers and calculates the cost based on the length of consecutive 1s, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   
2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` is not correctly handling the binary string input as expected.

#### Function Summaries:
- The summary for `func_2` mentions that it processes a specified number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, it also states that `t` must be at least 3, which is incorrect based on the problem statement where `t` can be as low as 1.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as they do not handle the binary string input properly and do not implement the required logic for cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required functionality and is therefore incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
