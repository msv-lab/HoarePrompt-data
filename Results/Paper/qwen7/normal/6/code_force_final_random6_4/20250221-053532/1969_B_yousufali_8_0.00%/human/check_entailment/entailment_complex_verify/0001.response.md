### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input should be a binary string.
   - It splits the input into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, which is incorrect for a binary string.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts. Specifically, it does not handle the cyclic shifts properly and instead counts the number of '1's followed by '0's without considering the actual cost of the shifts.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all '1's to the beginning of the string.
   - For each segment of '0's between two '1's, the cost is the length of the segment plus the length of the segment of '1's before it.

5. **Review of Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - However, the implementation in `func_1` is flawed and does not match the problem requirements.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not account for the correct cost calculation of cyclic shifts.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. They do not handle the cyclic shifts properly and do not calculate the minimum cost accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts.
