Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers, `i` is three more than the previous value, and `n` is either one more than its previous value (if `s[i] != 1` and `s[i] == 0`) or two more than its previous value (if `s[i] == 1` or `s[i] != 0`). Additionally, `ans` is the sum of the previous value of `n` plus 2 if the condition `s[i] == 0 and n != 0` is true.
