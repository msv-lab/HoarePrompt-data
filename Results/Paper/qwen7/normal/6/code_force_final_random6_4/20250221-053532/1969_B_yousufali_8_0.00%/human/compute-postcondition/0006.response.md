Output State: **`t` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or operations on `t`), the value of `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be at least 2 is still valid after the function call.
