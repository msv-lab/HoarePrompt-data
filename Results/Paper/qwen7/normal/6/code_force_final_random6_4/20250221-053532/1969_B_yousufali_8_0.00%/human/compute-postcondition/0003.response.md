Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:** `t` must be at least 1.
- **For Loop Statement:** 
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:** The loop runs based on the value of `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
2. **Initial State:** At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 1. This means `t` could be 1 or any positive integer.
3. **Next Iteration:** For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- Since `t` must be at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that `t` is currently a positive integer.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain greater than 0. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 again.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable involved in the loop condition is `t`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
