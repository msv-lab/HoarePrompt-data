#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as \(i\) (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than or equal to the square root of \(x\). Once \(i\) exceeds the square root of \(x\), the loop will terminate.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns the sum of `output2` and `output1`, where `output1` is the reversed version of a string or list that was iterated over until `i` exceeded the square root of `x`, and `output2` is undefined in the given information.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list is formed by combining `output2` and the reversed version of `output1`. The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`, adding pairs of divisors to `output1` and `output2`. After the loop, it reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` before returning the result.
