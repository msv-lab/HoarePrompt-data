Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate as long as \(i\) (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than or equal to the square root of \(x\). Once \(i\) exceeds the square root of \(x\), the loop will terminate; `output1` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1`. However, since no initial value or content of `output1` was provided, the only change is that `output1` is now reversed. The condition of the loop remains unchanged.
