Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 7, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3, 5]`, and `output2` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `output1.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 5, to the list `output1`. Initially, `output1` contains `[1, 3]`. After appending `i`, `output1` becomes `[1, 3, 5]`. The value of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and since `x` is not specified to be divisible by 4, `output2` remains an empty list. The value of `i` is updated to 7 because the original value of `i` was 5, and it is incremented by 2 (as per the typical behavior of such operations in similar contexts).
