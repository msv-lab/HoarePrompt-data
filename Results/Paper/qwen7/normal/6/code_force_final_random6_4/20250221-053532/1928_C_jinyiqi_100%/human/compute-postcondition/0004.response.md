Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is an empty list, and `x % i` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `output1.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `output1`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1 due to the loop condition, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `x % i` equals 0 is still valid since `x % 1` is always 0.
