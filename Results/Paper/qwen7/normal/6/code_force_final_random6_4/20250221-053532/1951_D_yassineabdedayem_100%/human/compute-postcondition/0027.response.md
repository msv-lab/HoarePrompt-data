Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
   - `t` is decreased by 1, but `t` is not used in the print statement.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The print statement calculates the value of `n - k + 1` and prints it followed by a space (`end=' '`).
   - Since `n` and `k` are explicitly defined as the first and second numbers entered respectively, their values are known.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The expression `n - k + 1` will be evaluated with the actual values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1**
