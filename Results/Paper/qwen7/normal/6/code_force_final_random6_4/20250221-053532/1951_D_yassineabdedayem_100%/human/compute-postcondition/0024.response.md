Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, and `t` is decreased by 1. However, the `print` statement only outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`. Therefore, the output will be **1**.
