Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, and both `n` and `k` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have processed all inputs specified by the initial value of `t`. If `n` was equal to `k` at any point, "YES" will have been printed followed by 1 and 1. If `n + 2` was greater than `k * 2` at any point, "YES" will have been printed followed by 2 and the calculated value of `n - k + 1`. Otherwise, "NO" will have been printed. The values of `n` and `k` will reflect the last state they were in before the loop terminated.
