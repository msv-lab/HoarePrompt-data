Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, and `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered. Additionally, `t` is decreased by 1, but since `t` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.
