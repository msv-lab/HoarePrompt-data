Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `t` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and then converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` is mentioned to be decreased by 1 in the initial state, but the actual value of `t` is not specified. Therefore, after the code executes, `n` and `k` are updated with the values from the input, and `t` is still decreased by 1, but its exact value is not known.
