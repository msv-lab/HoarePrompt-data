Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three variables: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. The function returns a value based on the relationship between these variables.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these variables internally to produce a result, but since the exact operation is not specified, the focus is on the parameters and their valid ranges.
