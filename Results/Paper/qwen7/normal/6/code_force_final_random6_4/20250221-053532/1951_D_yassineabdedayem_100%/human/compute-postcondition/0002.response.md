Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered**.

This means that the initial state reads two integers from standard input using `stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. Therefore, `n` is now an integer equal to the first number entered, and `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
