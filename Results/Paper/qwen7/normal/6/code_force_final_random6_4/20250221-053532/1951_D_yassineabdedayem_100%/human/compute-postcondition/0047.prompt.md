Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif n + 2 > k * 2:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
        print(1)
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `t` is decreased by 1. The condition holds as is if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged as per the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, and `t` is decreased by 1 regardless of whether `n` is equal to `k` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
