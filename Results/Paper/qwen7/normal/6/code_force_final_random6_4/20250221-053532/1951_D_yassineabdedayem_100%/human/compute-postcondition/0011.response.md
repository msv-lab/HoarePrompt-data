Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
- `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n + 2` is greater than the current value of `k * 2`.

We need to determine the value of `n - k + 1`.

Since `n` and `k` are the first and second numbers entered respectively, let's denote them as follows:
- Let `n = x` where `x` is the first number entered.
- Let `k = y` where `y` is the second number entered.

Given that `n + 2 > k * 2`, we substitute `n` and `k` with `x` and `y` respectively:
\[ x + 2 > 2y \]

We need to find the value of `n - k + 1`, which translates to:
\[ x - y + 1 \]

Since `x` and `y` are the actual values of the first and second numbers entered, the expression `x - y + 1` will be evaluated using these values.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **x - y + 1 (where x is the first number entered and y is the second number entered)**
