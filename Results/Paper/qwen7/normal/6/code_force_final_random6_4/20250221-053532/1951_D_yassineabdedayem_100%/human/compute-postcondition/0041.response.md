Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
   - `t` is decreased by 1, but `t` is not used in the print statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(n - k + 1, end=' ')`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `n - k + 1` will be evaluated with the values of `n` and `k` as provided by the user input.
   - Since `n` and `k` are explicitly defined as the first and second numbers entered respectively, the expression `n - k + 1` will give us the result of subtracting `k` from `n` and then adding 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The result of `n - k + 1` will be printed followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are the first and second numbers entered respectively)**
