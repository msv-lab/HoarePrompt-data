Output State: **`m` is 1, `u` is False, `v` is False, `n` is 1**

Explanation: The code `n -= ~u & v` updates the value of `n`. Here, `~u` is the bitwise NOT of `u`, which is `~False` or `~0`, resulting in `-1`. Then, `& v` is the bitwise AND between `-1` and `v`, which is `False` (or `0`). So, `-1 & 0` equals `0`. Thus, `n -= 0` means `n` remains unchanged. Since `n` was initially `m` (which is `1`), `n` stays `1`. The values of `m`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
