Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses a lambda function `R` to read input, but it does not properly handle the input format specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it reads the entire input for each test case in a single call to `R`, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, the array elements, and the number of queries `q`. However, the program only processes the last test case and ignores the rest.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Query Processing**: The logic inside the loop that processes the queries is flawed. It attempts to check if there is at least one integer within the range `[l, r]` that is present in both sets `a` and `b`, or in exactly one of them. However, the sets `a` and `b` are not defined based on the input ranges for each query. Instead, they seem to be defined based on the entire input for the test case, which is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints "YNEOS" based on some conditions, which is not aligned with the required output format. The required output is to print two integers `i` and `j` for each query where `a_i â‰  a_j`, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
