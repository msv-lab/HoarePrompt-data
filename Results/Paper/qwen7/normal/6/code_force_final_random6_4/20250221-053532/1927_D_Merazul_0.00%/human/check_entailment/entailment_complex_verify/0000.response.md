### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers.
- There are \( q \) queries, each defined by two integers \( l \) and \( r \).
- For each query, we need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( l \leq i \leq r \), \( l \leq j \leq r \), and \( a_i \neq a_j \). If no such pair exists, we output \(-1 -1\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definition and Input Parsing:**
   ```python
   def func():
       R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
       t, = R()  # Read the number of test cases
       while t:
           t -= 1
           *_, k = R()  # Read the length of the array and ignore the rest
           a = {*R()}  # Read the first half of the array as a set
           b = {*R()}  # Read the second half of the array as a set
           ...
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, and splits the array into two halves, converting them into sets.

2. **Set Operations and Query Handling:**
   ```python
   f = 1
   m = n = k // 2
   for i in range(1, k + 1):
       u = i in a
       v = i in b
       f &= u | v
       m -= u & ~v
       n -= ~u & v
   print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
   ```
   - The program iterates over the first \( k \) elements (since \( k \) is the length of the array divided by 2).
   - It checks if each element is in either set \( a \) or set \( b \).
   - The variables `f`, `m`, and `n` are used to track certain conditions, but their usage does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YNEOS' based on the conditions, but this does not match the expected output format.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Set Usage:**
   - The program reads the array into two sets, but it does not use these sets to find different elements within the specified query ranges.
   - Instead, it performs operations on the first half of the array, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

2. **Query Range Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the query ranges \( l \) and \( r \) correctly. It only considers the first half of the array, ignoring the specified range for each query.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints 'YNEOS', which does not match the required output format of printing indices \( i \) and \( j \).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
