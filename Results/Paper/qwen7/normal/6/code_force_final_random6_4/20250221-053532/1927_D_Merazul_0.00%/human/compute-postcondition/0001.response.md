Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; a new lambda function `R` is defined which maps input strings to a tuple of integers; `t` is now the first element returned by the lambda function `R` when called with an input string.**

This means that the value of `t` has been updated to the first integer returned by the lambda function `R` when called with an input string, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
