Output State: **`k` is the second element of R(), `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing one element from R(), `b` is a set containing one element from R(), `f` is 1.**

The code `f = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. Since `k`, `t`, `a`, and `b` were not affected by this assignment, their states remain unchanged.
