Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` must be greater than 0; `u` is False; `v` is False in 'b'; `f` is False; `m` is `m`; `n` is `n`**.

The code `v = i in b` checks if the value of `i` (which is 2) is present in the list `b`. Since the list `b` is not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value of `v`. However, we know that `v` will be `True` if `2` is in `b`, and `False` otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
