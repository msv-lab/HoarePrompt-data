Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments `1` and `k + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` equal to 1 because the range function starts at 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `i` must be within the range `[1, k]`.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `k` is already given as the second element of `R()`.
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once (since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `k`).

5. **Other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `m`, `n`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are unless explicitly required by the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust them based on the loop condition alone**.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 1 and `k` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0**
