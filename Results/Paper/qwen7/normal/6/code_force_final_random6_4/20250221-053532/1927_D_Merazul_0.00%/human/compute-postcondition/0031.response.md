Output State: **`k` is the second element of R(), `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `*_, k = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by `R()`. The `*` operator is used to match zero or more elements (in this case, it matches all but the last element), and `_` is a common convention for a variable that we don't care about. So, `k` is assigned the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
