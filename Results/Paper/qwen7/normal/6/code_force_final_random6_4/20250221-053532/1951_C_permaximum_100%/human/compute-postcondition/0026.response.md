Output State: `price_increase` is increased by the total number of tickets bought, `total_cost` is the sum of the cost of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `price` is the last updated price plus the final `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought` at the last iteration, `day` is the `day` value popped from the priority queue `pq` during the last iteration.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `price_increase` will have been incremented by the total number of tickets bought across all iterations. The `total_cost` will be the cumulative cost of all tickets purchased. `tickets_bought` will equal `k`, indicating that all available tickets have been bought. The `price` will reflect the final price per ticket after all increments. `tickets_to_buy` will be the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed to reach `k` at the last iteration, and `day` will be the `day` value from the last ticket purchase.
