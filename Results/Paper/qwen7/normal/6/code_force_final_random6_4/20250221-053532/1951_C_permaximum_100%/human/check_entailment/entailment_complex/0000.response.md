Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and the list of ticket prices for each day (`prices`).
2. The function `func_1` initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket price. This allows for efficient retrieval of the lowest price day.
3. The function uses a while loop to iteratively buy tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`. In each iteration:
   - It pops the lowest price from the priority queue.
   - It adjusts the price by adding the current `price_increase`.
   - It determines how many tickets can be bought on this day (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed to reach `k`.
   - It updates the total cost by multiplying the adjusted price by the number of tickets bought.
   - It increments the `tickets_bought` count and the `price_increase`.
4. The function ensures that the logic for increasing the ticket price after purchasing tickets on a particular day is correctly applied.
5. The function returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is calculated correctly based on the given constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
