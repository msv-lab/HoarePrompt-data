Output State: **`price_increase` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`, `price` is the smallest price popped from `pq`, `day` is the corresponding day of the smallest price popped from `pq`, `price` is increased by `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) as the minimum of `m` and the remaining available tickets (`k - tickets_bought`). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or updated states.
