Output State: **`tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `day` is the value popped from the priority queue `pq`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `price` is now `price + price_increase`, `day` is unchanged, and `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`.**

Explanation: The line `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` adds the cost of buying `tickets_to_buy` tickets at the current `price` to `total_cost`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
