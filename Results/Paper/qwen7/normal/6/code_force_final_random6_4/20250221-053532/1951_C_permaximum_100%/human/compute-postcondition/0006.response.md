Output State: **`price_increase` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`, `price` is the smallest price popped from `pq`, `day` is the corresponding day of the smallest price popped from `pq`.**

Explanation: The code `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` pops the smallest element from the priority queue `pq` and assigns the first element of the tuple to `price` and the second element to `day`. The values of `price_increase` and `total_cost` remain unchanged, and the condition for `tickets_bought` (being less than `k`) is still valid.
