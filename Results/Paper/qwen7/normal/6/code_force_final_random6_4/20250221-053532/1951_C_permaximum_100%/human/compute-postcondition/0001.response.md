Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, and `pq` has been transformed into a min-heap.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a min-heap. In a min-heap, the smallest element is always at the root. The structure of the list itself changes to maintain this property, but the content (i.e., the prices and their indices) remains the same. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.
