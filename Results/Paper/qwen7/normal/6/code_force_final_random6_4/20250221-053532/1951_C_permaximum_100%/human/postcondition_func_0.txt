The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the number of tickets to be bought), and `prices` (a list of ticket prices for each day). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the price increases based on the number of tickets bought each day.
