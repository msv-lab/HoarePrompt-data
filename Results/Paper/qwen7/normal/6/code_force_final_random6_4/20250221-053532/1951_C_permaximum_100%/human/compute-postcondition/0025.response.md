Output State: **`tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `2 * tickets_to_buy`, `day` is the value popped from the priority queue `pq`, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `price` is now `price + price_increase`, `day` is the value popped from the priority queue `pq`, `price_increase` is increased by `2 * tickets_to_buy`, `price` is increased by `2 * price_increase`, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy**.

Explanation: The code `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` increases the value of `price_increase` by `tickets_to_buy`. Since `tickets_to_buy` is defined as the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, and the operation is performed twice, `price_increase` is effectively increased by `2 * tickets_to_buy`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
