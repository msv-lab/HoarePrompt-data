Functionality: **The function reads an integer N and a list of N integers from the input. It then iteratively applies a function `func_1` to an initial value `den` using each element from the list `vals`. After the iterations, it calculates a new list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and does not return anything. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.**
