Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `x` and the list `vals`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `den` is initially set to the first element of `vals`.
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( k_i \) satisfies \( 2 \leq k_i \leq 20 \).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `den` is already set to the first element of `vals`, no adjustment is needed for `den`.
   - The list `vals` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Given that `N` is the length of `vals`, `N` must be at least 1.
   - The variable `x` will take on the value of each element in `vals` during each iteration, starting from the first element (which is `den`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `N` must be at least 1.
- `vals` must be a list with at least one element.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`den` is equal to the first element of `vals`, `N` must be at least 1, `vals` must be a list with at least one element**.
