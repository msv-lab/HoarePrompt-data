### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the necessary logic to solve the problem. However, let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure every detail aligns with the problem requirements and the provided function summary.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)}\). This is essential for finding the LCM of all multipliers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the list of multipliers \(k_i\).
   - **LCM Calculation**: It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively updates `den` using `func_1` with each subsequent multiplier. This ensures `den` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - **Bet Calculation**: It calculates `vprod` as `den // r` for each multiplier \(r\), representing the maximum possible bet for each outcome.
   - **Condition Check**: It checks if the sum of `vprod` is less than `den`. If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the detailed breakdown and the function summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic. However, let's verify the key points:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation is correct and ensures the minimal total bet.
- **Bet Calculation**: The bets are calculated correctly as `den // r` for each outcome.
- **Condition Check**: The condition check ensures the total bet is strictly less than the LCM value.

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and confirms the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
