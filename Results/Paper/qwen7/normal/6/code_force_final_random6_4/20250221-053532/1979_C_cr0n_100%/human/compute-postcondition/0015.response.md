Based on the initial state provided:

- `den` is equal to `den - sum(vprod)`, and the value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Since the value of `den` being less than or equal to 0 does not affect the execution of the `print(-1)` statement directly, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
