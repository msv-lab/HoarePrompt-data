Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in vals:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `vals`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more values in `vals` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `den` is equal to `func_1(den, x)`.
   - `x` is the value that was used in the previous iteration to update `den`.

4. **Next Iteration Preparation**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must still contain more elements.
   - The variable `x` will take the next value from `vals`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `den` is updated based on the current `x`, it remains unchanged for the next iteration.
   - The variable `x` will be the next element in `vals`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that `x` is now the next element in `vals`, and `den` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`den` is equal to `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the next element in `vals`**
