### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
- For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we receive \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins.
- The total bet must be strictly less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for all winning outcomes.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - This ensures that the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - Computes the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
   - Divides this LCM by each multiplier to get a list `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - Subtracts the sum of `vprod` from the LCM to get `den`.
   - If `den` is non-negative, prints the elements of `vprod`; otherwise, prints `-1`.

#### Key Points:
- The program aims to find a common denominator (`den`) that is a multiple of all multipliers.
- The `vprod` list is constructed by dividing this common denominator by each multiplier.
- The final check ensures that the remaining value (`den`) is positive, indicating that the total bet is less than the potential winnings for at least one outcome.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input:
```
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```

1. Compute the LCM of all multipliers:
   - Initial `den = 7`
   - Update `den` using `func_1(den, 9)`: `den = 63`
   - Update `den` using `func_1(den, 3)`: `den = 63`
   - Update `den` using `func_1(den, 17)`: `den = 63`
   - Update `den` using `func_1(den, 9)`: `den = 63`
   - Update `den` using `func_1(den, 13)`: `den = 63`

2. Construct `vprod`:
   - `vprod = [63 // 7, 63 // 9, 63 // 3, 63 // 17, 63 // 9, 63 // 13] = [9, 7, 21, 3, 7, 4]`

3. Subtract the sum of `vprod` from `den`:
   - `den = 63 - (9 + 7 + 21 + 3 + 7 + 4) = 22`

4. Since `den` is positive, the program prints the values in `vprod`.

#### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly computes a common denominator that is a multiple of all multipliers.
- The `vprod` list ensures that the total bet is distributed in such a way that the total bet is strictly less than the potential winnings for at least one outcome.

Given the analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
