### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the multiplier \( k_i \) determines the amount of coins returned if that outcome wins.
   - We need to find a distribution of coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - `func_2` processes each test case:
     - It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
     - It calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
     - It then computes the required bet amounts for each outcome such that the total bet is less than the return amount for each outcome.
     - Finally, it prints the bet amounts or `-1` if no valid distribution exists.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the bet amounts are distributed in a way that minimizes the total bet while ensuring the condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) holds.
   - The logic for calculating the bet amounts \( vprod \) and adjusting `den` ensures that the total bet is minimized and still satisfies the condition.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the total bet exceeds the return amount by printing `-1`.
   - The code correctly computes the LCM and distributes the bets accordingly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It ensures that the total bet is minimized and still satisfies the condition for all outcomes.
