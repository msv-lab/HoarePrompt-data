Output State: **`den` is equal to `func_1(func_1(den, x), x)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `den` by calling the function `func_1` with `den` and `x` as arguments. Since `den` was initially equal to `func_1(den, x)`, after the execution of `den = func_1(den, x)`, `den` now equals `func_1(func_1(den, x), x)`. The value of `x` remains unchanged from its previous state.
