Output State: **`N` is an input integer, and `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies 2 â‰¤ `k_i` â‰¤ 20, and `vals` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes an input integer `N` and then creates a list `vals` by splitting the next input (a space-separated string of integers) and converting each element to an integer. This means `vals` will now contain exactly `N` integers, each within the range of 2 to 20. The original value of `N` remains unchanged, and the new list `vals` contains the integers provided in the input.
