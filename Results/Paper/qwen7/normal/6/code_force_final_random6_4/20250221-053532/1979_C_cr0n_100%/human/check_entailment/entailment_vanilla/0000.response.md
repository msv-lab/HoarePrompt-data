Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would receive back for any winning outcome. 

### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input for one test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N`.
   - It reads the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (`den`).
   - It then computes the values `vprod` which represent the maximum possible bet for each outcome such that the total bet is less than the reward for any outcome.
   - Finally, it prints the values `vprod` if the total bet is less than the reward for any outcome; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Calculation of LCM**:
   - The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the total bet is minimized while ensuring the condition is met.

2. **Bet Calculation**:
   - For each outcome, the bet is calculated as `den // r`, where `r` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - The sum of these bets should be less than the LCM value (`den`).

3. **Checking Condition**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total bet is less than the LCM value (`den`).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Testing the Logic
- The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the required conditions.
- The use of LCM ensures that the total bet is minimized.
- The check at the end ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any outcome.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
