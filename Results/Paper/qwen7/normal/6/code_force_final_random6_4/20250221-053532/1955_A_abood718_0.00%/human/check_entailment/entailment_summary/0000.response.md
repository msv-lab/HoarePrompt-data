Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Promotion Price**: The program checks if `B * 2 < C` (i.e., whether the regular price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion price for two yogurts). If this condition is true, it should print `A * B`, which is incorrect because it should be printing the minimum cost using the promotion.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Even and Odd Cases**: 
   - For even `A`, it calculates `int(A * C / 2)` which is correct.
   - For odd `A`, it prints `A // 2` and then `A // 2 * C + B`. This is also incorrect because it should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then add the cost of the remaining single yogurt(s).

3. **Output Format**: The program prints `X` and then `X * C + B` separately for odd `A`, which is not the expected output format. It should directly print the total cost.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            # If the promotion price is better, calculate the minimum cost using the promotion
            num_pairs = A // 2
            remaining_yogurts = A % 2
            total_cost = num_pairs * C + remaining_yogurts * B
            print(total_cost)
        else:
            # Otherwise, calculate the cost at the regular price
            print(A * B)

# Example usage
func()
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
