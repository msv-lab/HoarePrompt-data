Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where it is cheaper to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the rest at the promotion price. For example, consider the input `n=3`, `a=5`, and `b=11`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to buy one yogurt at 5 burles and two yogurts at 11 burles, resulting in a total cost of `5 + 11 = 16` burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as `15` burles by always using the promotion price for pairs of yogurts. This can be seen in the following test case:

Input:
```
3
5 5 11
```

Expected Output:
```
16
```

Actual Output:
```
15
```

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
