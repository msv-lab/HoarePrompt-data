Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and `X` is `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `A`, `B`, and `C`. Additionally, the value of `X` is now defined based on the value of `A` (if `A` is even, `X` is `A // 2`, otherwise `X` remains undefined).
