Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)**.

This means that the variable `t` retains its original value, `i` remains unchanged at 0, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the values of the three integers separated by spaces from the input, each being a non-negative integer within the specified range.
