Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is specified that `A` is even, let's denote it as `A = 2k` where `k` is an integer.
- `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). It satisfies the condition \(B * 2 \geq C\).
- `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).

The expression to be evaluated is `int(A * C / 2)`.

Since `A` is even, let's assume `A = 2` for simplicity (the actual value doesn't affect the logic, but it must be even).

Let's also assume `C = 4` (it could be any even number, but this simplifies the calculation), and `B` could be any number such that \(B * 2 \geq 4\). For example, if `B = 2`, the condition is satisfied.

Now, substituting these values into the expression:

\[ \text{int}(A * C / 2) = \text{int}(2 * 4 / 2) = \text{int}(8 / 2) = \text{int}(4) = 4 \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **4**
