Given the initial state:

- `i` is 0
- `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
- `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
- `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
- \(B * 2 < C\)
- `X` is \(A // 2\)

We need to determine the value of `X` which is \(A // 2\).

Since `A` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), let's consider the formula for `X`:

\[ X = A // 2 \]

This means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2. For example, if `A` is 5, then `X` would be 2 (since 5 // 2 = 2).

However, since the exact value of `A` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of `A`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **A // 2 (where A is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\))**
