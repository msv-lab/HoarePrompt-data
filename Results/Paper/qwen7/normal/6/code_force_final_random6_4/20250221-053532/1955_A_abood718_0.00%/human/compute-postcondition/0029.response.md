Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the first non-negative integer, `A` is 1.
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the second non-negative integer, `B` is 2.
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the third non-negative integer, `C` is 3.
   - `X` is `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` is undefined. Since `A` is 1 (which is odd), `X` is undefined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(X * C + B)
   ```

Given that `X` is undefined because `A` is odd, the expression `X * C + B` involves an undefined term. Therefore, the expression cannot be evaluated, and the print statement will raise an error.

However, based on the format required, we need to describe the output in a way that reflects the given conditions.

Output: **undefined**
