Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - The condition \(B * 2 < C\) must hold true.
   - `X` is calculated as \(A // 2\).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

Given the constraints:
- Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are non-negative integers within the specified range, let's denote them as specific values that satisfy the condition \(B * 2 < C\). For simplicity, let's assume:
  - `A = 4` (a typical non-negative integer in the range).
  - `B = 1` (a typical non-negative integer in the range).
  - `C = 3` (since \(B * 2 = 2\) and \(2 < 3\)).

Then:
- `X = A // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2`.

Substituting these values into the print statement:
- `print(X * C + B) = print(2 * 3 + 1) = print(6 + 1) = print(7)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **7**
