The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers A, B, and C. For each test case, it prints one or two values based on specific conditions. If B * 2 is less than C, it prints A * B. If A is even, it prints int(A * C / 2). If A is odd, it prints A // 2 followed by A // 2 * C + B. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
