Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and `X` is `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `X = A // 2` assigns the value of `A // 2` to `X` only if `A` is even. If `A` is odd, `X` remains undefined. The values of `t`, `i`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged.
