Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the first non-negative integer, `A` is 1.
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the second non-negative integer, `B` is 2.
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the third non-negative integer, `C` is 3.
   - `X` is `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` remains undefined. Since `A` is 1, which is odd, `X` remains undefined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

Given the values from the initial state:
- `A` is 1.
- `C` is 3.

The expression inside the `print` function is `int(A * C / 2)`. Substituting the values:
- `A * C` is \(1 * 3 = 3\).
- `3 / 2` is \(1.5\).
- `int(1.5)` converts `1.5` to the integer `1`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output `1`.

Output: **1**
