Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(X * C + B)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `X`, `C`, and `B`:

- `X` is `A // 2`, which means it is the integer division of `A` by 2.
- `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
- `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not specified, we need to consider the general form of the expression `X * C + B`.

The expression to be printed is `X * C + B`, where:
- `X = A // 2`
- `C` is the third non-negative integer within the specified range.
- `B` is the second non-negative integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression `X * C + B` with the values of `X`, `C`, and `B` as described above.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
