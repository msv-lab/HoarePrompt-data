Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
- `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
- `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
- The condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(A * B)`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are the first, second, and third non-negative integers within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).

The key point here is the calculation of `A * B`. Since `A` and `B` are the first and second non-negative integers respectively, they are both 1 by default if no other inputs are specified. Therefore, `A * B` would be \(1 * 1 = 1\).

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1**
