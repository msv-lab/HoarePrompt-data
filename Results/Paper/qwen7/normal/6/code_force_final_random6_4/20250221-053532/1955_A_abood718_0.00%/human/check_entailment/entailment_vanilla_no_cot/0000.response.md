Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Promotion Cost Comparison:**
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks whether buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. However, this should be `if C < B * 2:` to check if the promotion price is cheaper.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - When the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, the program calculates the cost using `X = A // 2` which will not correctly handle the remaining yogurt. It should calculate the cost as `X * C + B` for the remaining yogurt.

3. **Redundant Print Statements:**
   - There are redundant print statements inside the `else` block that should not be there.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if C < B * 2:
            # If the promotion is cheaper, use the promotion
            total_cost = (A // 2) * C + min(A % 2, 1) * B
        else:
            # Otherwise, buy all yogurts at the regular price
            total_cost = A * B
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected function properly handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts and ensures the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
