Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer.
   - Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input value from `int(input())` should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input value from `int(input())` is within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is valid.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The input value from `int(input())` must be a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will iterate `t` times, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and it will be incremented in each iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, and the input value from `int(input())` must be a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)**
