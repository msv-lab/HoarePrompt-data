Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will run until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

Based on this analysis, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
