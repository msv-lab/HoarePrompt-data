Based on the initial state and the precondition provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 1001.
- `i` is defined as `1004 + (n - 3)`, but after the loop, it is described as `1001 + n`, indicating that `i` starts at 1002 and increments by 1 for each iteration, leading to `i = 1001 + n`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to run correctly.

The `print(' ')` statement simply prints an empty space character.

Output: **' '**
