Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), after decrementing by 1, `t` will now be an input integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive). The value of `n` remains unchanged, so it still satisfies the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
