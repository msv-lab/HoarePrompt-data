Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be able to start from 1 and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the Given States**:
   - The initial value of `t` (an input integer between 0 and 49) does not affect whether the loop can execute.
   - The initial value of `n` (an input integer between 2 and 1000) must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` will start from 1 when the loop begins.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be at least 1, and `i` will start from 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
