Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `i` is defined as `i_end + 2`.
2. We also know that `n` must be `n_value`.

The print statement only involves printing the value of `i`. Since `i` is explicitly defined as `i_end + 2`, we can directly substitute this into the print statement.

Output: **i_end + 2**
