Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program does not attempt to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Instead, it simply prints \(n\) cells in the format \((1, i)\) for each row \(i\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. This approach will always result in the same Manhattan distances: \(0\) (for cells in the same row) and \(1\) (for adjacent cells in different rows). Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will only contain \{0, 1\}, regardless of the value of \(n\).
4. The goal is to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), which means we need to find a configuration that produces more unique distances. The example solutions provided in the problem statement show configurations that produce a larger set of distances.

Given these points, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
