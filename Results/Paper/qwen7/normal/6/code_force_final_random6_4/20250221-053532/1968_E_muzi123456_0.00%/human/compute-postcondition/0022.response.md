Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1001
   - `i` is 1002
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1002, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 1001 (since `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1003.
   - `n` must be greater than 1001.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is 1001, `i` is 1003, `n` must be greater than 1001**
