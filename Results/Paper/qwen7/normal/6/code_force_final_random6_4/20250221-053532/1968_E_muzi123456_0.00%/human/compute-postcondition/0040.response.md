Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `n` must be `n_value`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the following code snippet is executed:

```python
print(i)
```

Given the initial state, we know that `i` is defined as `i_end + 1`. Since `i_end` is not explicitly given a value, we can only express `i` in terms of `i_end`.

Therefore, the value of `i` is `i_end + 1`.

Output: **i_end + 1**
