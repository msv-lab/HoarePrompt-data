Based on the initial state provided, there are no variables or objects defined except for the `print(i)` statement itself. Since no value for `i` is explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`. Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `i` as it is at the time the print statement is executed.

Output: **i**
