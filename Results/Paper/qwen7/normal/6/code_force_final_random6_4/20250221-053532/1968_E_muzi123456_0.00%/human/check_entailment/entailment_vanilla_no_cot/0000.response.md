Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Instead, it simply prints each cell in the format `(1, i)` for `i` from `1` to `n`. This will not necessarily maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to strategically place the points to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the optimal placement would be \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,1)\), as shown in the note.
