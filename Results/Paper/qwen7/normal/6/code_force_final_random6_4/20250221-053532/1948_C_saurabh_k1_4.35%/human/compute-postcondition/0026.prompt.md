Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string. If the second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) is equal to '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, the second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) is not equal to '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string, and `b` is updated to be the result of `map(str, input())`. This holds true regardless of whether `b[n-2]` equals `str('<')` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string, `b` is now a list of strings created by converting each character of the new input string to a string. If `b[n - 2]` equals '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
