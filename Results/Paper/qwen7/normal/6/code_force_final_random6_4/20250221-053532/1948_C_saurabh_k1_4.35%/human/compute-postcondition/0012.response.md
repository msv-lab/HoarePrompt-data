Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state, where `a` is a list of strings representing characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string.
