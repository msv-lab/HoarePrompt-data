Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) representing the length of strings, and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '/>'. The function returns a result based on the comparison of these two strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
