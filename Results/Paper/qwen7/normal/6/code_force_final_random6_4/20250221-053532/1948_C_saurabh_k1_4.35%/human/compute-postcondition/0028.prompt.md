You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed for all test cases provided. For each test case, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 2⋅10^5 (inclusive) and is even. `a` will be a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string for that test case, and `b` will be a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string for that test case to a string. After processing all test cases, if for any test case `b[n-2]` is not equal to '<', the loop will have printed 'Yes' for that test case; otherwise, it will have printed 'No'. The final state will reflect the outcome of running the loop for all test cases, with `n`, `a`, and `b` updated according to the inputs of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) representing the length of strings, and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '/>'. The function returns a result based on the comparison of these two strings for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
