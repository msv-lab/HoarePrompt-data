Output State: The loop will have executed for all test cases provided. For each test case, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5 (inclusive) and is even. `a` will be a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string for that test case, and `b` will be a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string for that test case to a string. After processing all test cases, if for any test case `b[n-2]` is not equal to '<', the loop will have printed 'Yes' for that test case; otherwise, it will have printed 'No'. The final state will reflect the outcome of running the loop for all test cases, with `n`, `a`, and `b` updated according to the inputs of each test case.
