Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only checks the second last character of the second row's string and makes a decision based on that. This approach is incomplete and incorrect because it does not account for the robot's movement through the grid according to the arrows in both rows.

The program should simulate the robot's movement through the grid for each test case, following the rules specified:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. It moves to the next cell in the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
3. It must eventually reach (2, n).

The given solution only checks if the second last arrow in the second row is pointing left ('<'), which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n). Here is why the provided solution is incorrect:

- It does not consider the first row's arrows.
- It does not simulate the robot's path through the entire grid.
- It does not handle all possible paths that the robot might take.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
