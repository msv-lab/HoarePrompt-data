Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive); `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input string and converts each character of the string into a separate element in the list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not used in the code. Therefore, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `a` is now a list of strings, each representing a character from the input string.
