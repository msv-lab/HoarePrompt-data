Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string. If the second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) is equal to '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, the second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) is not equal to '<'.
