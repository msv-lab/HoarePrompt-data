Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program only checks if the second last character (`b[n - 2]`) of the second row is not `<`. This condition is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. The robot must follow the arrows in both rows to determine if it can reach the target cell.

2. **Movement Logic**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid. It simply checks one specific condition without considering the entire path the robot might take based on the arrows.

3. **Output for All Test Cases**: The program should output 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. However, the provided code only handles one test case at a time and does not accumulate results for multiple test cases.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
