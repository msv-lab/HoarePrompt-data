Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string, `b` is now a list of strings created by converting each character of the new input string to a string. If `b[n - 2]` equals '<', no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
