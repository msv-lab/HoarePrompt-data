Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string, and `b` is updated to be the result of `map(str, input())`. This holds true regardless of whether `b[n-2]` equals `str('<')` or not.**
