Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2⋅10^5 and \( n \) is even), and two strings of length \( n \) consisting of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, it reads the two strings, checks if the second last character of the second string is '<', and prints 'No' if true, otherwise prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.**
