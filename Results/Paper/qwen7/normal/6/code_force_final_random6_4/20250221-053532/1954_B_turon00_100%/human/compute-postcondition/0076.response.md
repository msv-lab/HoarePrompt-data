Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n` (as given in the initial state).
   - The variable `n` is also provided as an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n`, we don't need to change its value directly.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1**
