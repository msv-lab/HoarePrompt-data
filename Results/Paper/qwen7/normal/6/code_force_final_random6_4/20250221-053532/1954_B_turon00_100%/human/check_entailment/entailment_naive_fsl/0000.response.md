Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the requirement to remove the minimum number of elements to make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, it seems to be counting the maximum consecutive elements that are the same, which does not solve the problem as described.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
1
-1
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
-1
3
-1
3
```

The program incorrectly counts the number of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the answer, which does not align with the problem's requirements. For example, in the second test case, the program outputs `3` instead of `1`, because it counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements (which is `3`), but the correct answer should be `1` since removing the element at index `5` (value `1`) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
