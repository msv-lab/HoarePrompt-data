Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `cnt` will be the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` will be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `n-1`). The variable `cnt` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`. The variable `ans` will store the minimum value between its initial value (`n`) and the maximum `cnt` encountered during the loop execution whenever an element in `a` matches `tmp`.
