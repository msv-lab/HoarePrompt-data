Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
