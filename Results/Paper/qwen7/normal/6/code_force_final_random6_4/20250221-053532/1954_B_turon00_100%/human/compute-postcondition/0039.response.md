Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` remains the minimum value between its current value and the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution, `cnt` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `cnt` is updated to 0.
