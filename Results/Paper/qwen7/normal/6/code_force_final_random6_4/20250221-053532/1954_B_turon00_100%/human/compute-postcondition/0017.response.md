Output State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state where `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (which is updated to 1 if `a[1]` equals `tmp`) and `cnt` (which is 0), `ans` will be set to 0 because 0 is less than 1. The values of `i` and `cnt` remain unchanged.
