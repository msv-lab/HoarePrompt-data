Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution. This holds true regardless of whether `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or if `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.
