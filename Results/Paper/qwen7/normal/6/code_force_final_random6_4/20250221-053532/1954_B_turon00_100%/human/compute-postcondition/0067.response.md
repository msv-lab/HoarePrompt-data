Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and `cnt` is 0. The condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` holds true.**
