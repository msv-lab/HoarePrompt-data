Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cnt` and retains the initial states of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp`.
