Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is updated based on whether `a[i]` equals `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
