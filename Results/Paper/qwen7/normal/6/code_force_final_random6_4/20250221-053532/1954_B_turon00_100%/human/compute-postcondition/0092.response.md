Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`.
   - `t` is decreased by `1`.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`.
   - `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will increment from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n + 2` (since it was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Other States:**
   - `tmp` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `ans` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `t` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `a[i]` will now refer to the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` becomes `n + 2`.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `n + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 2`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.**
