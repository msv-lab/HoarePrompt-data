Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution. Additionally, whether `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the final values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` will satisfy these conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and `cnt` is 0. If either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no change occurs. Otherwise, the condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `2 * n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `t` is decreased by `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and either `n == 1 or ans == n` is satisfied, or `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
