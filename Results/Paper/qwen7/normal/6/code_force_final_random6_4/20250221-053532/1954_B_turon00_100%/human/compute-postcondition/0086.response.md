Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`.
   - `cnt` is either `1` or `0`.
   - `t` is decreased by `1`.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`.
   - `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will increment `i` by `1` in the next iteration (because `range(n)` means `i` goes from `0` to `n-1`).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Other states remain the same**:
   - `a`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cnt`, `t`, and the condition `a[i]` being either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`, `cnt` is either `1` or `0`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`**.
