Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns information about each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a test count `t`, a size `n`, and an array `a` of integers. The function processes these inputs and provides some form of output or result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
