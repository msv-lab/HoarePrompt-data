Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution
- Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`

The code snippet provided is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This means that regardless of the values of `i`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `a`, `ans`, and `n`, the `print` statement will output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
