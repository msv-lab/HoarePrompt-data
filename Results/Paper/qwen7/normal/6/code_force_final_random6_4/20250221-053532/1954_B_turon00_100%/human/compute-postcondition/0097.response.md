Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 2`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `cnt` and `ans`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains `0` and `ans` is updated to the minimum between `cnt` and `ans`.**
