Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `m`, `n`, `count`, `ans`, and `countmins` remain unchanged.
