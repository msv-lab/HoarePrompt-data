Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `count - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is decremented by 1, resulting in `countmins` being assigned the value `count - 1`, which is `1` since `count` was initially `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
