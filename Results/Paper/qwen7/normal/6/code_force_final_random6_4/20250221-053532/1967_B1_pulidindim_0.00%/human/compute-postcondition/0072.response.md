Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `t` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2**
