Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0) + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 2 - 0) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / 2 - 0`, and `g` is equal to `countmins`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += g / count + 1` updates the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value. Given that `g` is equal to `n / 2 - 0`, which simplifies to `n / 2`, and `count` is 2, the expression `g / count + 1` becomes `(n / 2) / 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n / 4 + 1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to its original value plus `n / 4 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
