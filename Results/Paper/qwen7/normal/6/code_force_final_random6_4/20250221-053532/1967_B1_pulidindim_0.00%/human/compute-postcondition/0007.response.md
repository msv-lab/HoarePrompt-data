Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n / count` to the variable `g`. Since `count` is 1, `g` becomes `n / 1`, which simplifies to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `countmins` becomes `count - 1`, which is 0.
