Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on whitespace, converting each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged.
