Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (2 - 1) / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The value of `ans` is updated based on the new value of `count`.
