Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or altered within the scope of the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions and adds the information that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
