Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + (countmins - 1) / count + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value. Given that `g` is defined as `countmins - 1` and `countmins` is 1, `g` is 0. Also, `count` is 2. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `n + 0 / 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
