Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `countmins = count - 1` updates the value of `countmins` from its previous value of 2 to `count - 1`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
