Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + (n / 5 - 1) / 6 + 2 + (n / 7 - 2) / 8 + ... + (n / count - (count-3)) / count + (count-3)`, `countmins` is `count - 3`, and `g` is `n / (count - 1) - (count - 3)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. The value of `ans` will be updated in each iteration based on the formula given by the loop. Specifically, for each `count` from 2 to `m`, `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`, where `g` is adjusted in each iteration. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these increments starting from the initial value of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` is at least 6, `n` is an input integer, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is calculated as follows: `ans = n + (2 - 1) / 3 + 1 + (n / 4 - 3) / 5 + 1 + (n / 5 - 7) / 6 + 1 + ... + (n / (m-1) - (m-5)) / m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `n / m - (m - 1)`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` starting from 1 up to `m`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum based on the formula provided for each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`countmins` and `g`) are updated according to the loop's logic, with `countmins` being `m - 1` and `g` being `n / count - countmins` for the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least the value that causes the loop to exit, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `n` plus the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left(\frac{n}{k} - (k-2)\right) + 1\), `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / (m + 1) - 0`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`. For each iteration, `ans` accumulates the value of `g / count + 1`, where `g` is adjusted based on the current `count`. After `m` iterations, `count` becomes `m + 1`, and `ans` contains the sum of the series described above.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
