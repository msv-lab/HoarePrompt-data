Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 6, `count` is 6, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0) + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 2 - 0) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 1) / 3 + 1 + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + (n / 4 - 2) / 4 + 1 + (n / 4 - 1) / 4 + 1 + (n / 5 - 2) / 5 + 1 + (n / 5 - 0) / 5 + 1`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `count` will be 6 because the loop continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum based on the formula provided for each iteration, and it continues to add terms until `count` reaches 6.
