Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`, if `g < countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `g -= countmins` subtracts `countmins` (which is 1) from `g`. Initially, `g` is `n / 2`. After the subtraction, `g` becomes `n / 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
