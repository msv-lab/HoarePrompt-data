Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic inside the `while` loop does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs. Specifically, it seems to be trying to increment `ans` based on some arithmetic operations that do not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Misunderstanding of Conditions**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for every pair \((a, b)\). The current implementation does not properly handle this condition.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - The `while` loop continues to increment `count` until it exceeds `m`. This might lead to an infinite loop if the logic inside the loop is not correctly implemented to terminate under the given constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This approach iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
