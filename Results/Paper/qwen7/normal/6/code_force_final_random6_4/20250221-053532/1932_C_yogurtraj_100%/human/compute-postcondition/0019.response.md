Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string representation of `t`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`, and the last character of `t` is 'L'. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and the last character of `t` is not 'L'.
