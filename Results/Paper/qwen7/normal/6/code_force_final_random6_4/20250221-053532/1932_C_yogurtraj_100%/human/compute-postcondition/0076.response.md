Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `t` is a list where the element at index `i` is not 'R', `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. The initial state of `i` is `n - 2`, `t` is a list where the element at index `i` is not 'R', and `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`. After executing the code, `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation, `t` remains unchanged as its element at index `i` is not 'R', and `k` remains unchanged as the operation only modified `q1` which is used in the calculation of `k`. Therefore, the updated value of `i` is `n - 3` (since `q1` was decremented), while `t` and `k` retain their original conditions.
