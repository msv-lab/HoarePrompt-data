Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `q1 = l - 1` updates the value of `q1` to be `l - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
