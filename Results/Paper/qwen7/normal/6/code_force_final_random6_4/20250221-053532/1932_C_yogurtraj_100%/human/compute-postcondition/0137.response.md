Output State: **`k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `i` is -3, `n` must be at least 1**

Explanation: The variable `q1` is decremented by 1. Initially, `q1` was an index used in the expression `a[q1]`. After decrementing `q1` by 1, the new value of `q1` is used in the same expression `a[q1]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the operation. The value of `i` is updated to `-2 - 1`, which is `-3`. The condition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
