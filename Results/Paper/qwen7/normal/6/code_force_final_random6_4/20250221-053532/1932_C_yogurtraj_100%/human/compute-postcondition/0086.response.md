Output State: **`i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`; `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` equals 'R', or `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise; `y[i]` is now equal to `k`; if `t[i]` equals 'R', `q2` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `q1` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y[i]` is updated to be equal to `k`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial postcondition.
