Output State: **`i` is either 0 or -2, `n` must be at least 1, `y[i]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `y[i] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the element of the list `y` at the index `i`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is either 0 or -2, and `n` must be at least 1. The value of `y[i]` is now `k`.
