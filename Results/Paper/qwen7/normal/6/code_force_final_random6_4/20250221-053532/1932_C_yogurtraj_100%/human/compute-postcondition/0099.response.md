Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `n` remains an input integer as it was not directly involved in the operation.
