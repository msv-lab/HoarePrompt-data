The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), followed by \( n \) and \( m \) (both positive integers), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the given string \( s \) and array \( a \), and outputs this sequence as a list of integers. The final output for each test case is a list \( y \) of \( n \) elements, where each element is derived through a series of multiplications and modulo operations based on the characters in \( s \) and the values in \( a \).
