Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is `k` right-shifted by 1, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 3, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k` by 1 bit. This means that the value of `k` is divided by 2 (integer division). The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact value of `k` was not specified, we only know that it is now half of its original value, assuming `k` was even. If `k` was odd, it would be rounded down after the division. The output state includes all the variables and their updated states based on the given operations.
