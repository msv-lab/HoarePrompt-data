Output State: **`i` must be one of the values in `arr` = [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191], `c` equals `n - 1`, `k0` is a variable that has not been defined, `ans` is a list with a new element `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `c`, `k0`, or `ans`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is within. Since no such loop or if statement is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
