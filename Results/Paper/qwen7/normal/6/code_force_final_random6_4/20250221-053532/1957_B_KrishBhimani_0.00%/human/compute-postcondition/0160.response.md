Output State: `k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 15, `c` is 16, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2, -2, 1, -4, 3, -8, 5, -16, 9, -32, 17, -64, 33, -128, 65].

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the array `arr`. For each iteration, it appends `1 << i` to the list `ans` and increments `c`. The loop breaks when `c` equals `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. Since `arr` has 16 elements, the loop will run 16 times. After 16 iterations, `c` will be 16, and `ans` will contain the appended values which are powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{15}\) with alternating signs as per the given conditions.
