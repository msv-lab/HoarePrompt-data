Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 0, `c` is 1, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2, -2]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `k` is 0 and `ans` is `[0, -1, 2]`. The sum of `ans` is `0 + (-1) + 2 = 1`. Therefore, `k - sum(ans)` equals `0 - 1 = -1`. This value is appended to `ans`, resulting in `ans` becoming `[0, -1, 2, -2]`. The values of `k`, `arr`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.
