Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is 0.
   - `arr` is a list containing the integers from 0 to 15: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
   - `i` is 15.
   - `c` is 16.
   - `ans` is a list with specific values: `[0, -1, 2, -2, 1, -4, 3, -8, 5, -16, 9, -32, 17, -64, 33, -128, 65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the list `ans` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Given the explicit values in the list `ans`, the output will be the elements of this list printed sequentially.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0 -1 2 -2 1 -4 3 -8 5 -16 9 -32 17 -64 33 -128 65 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0**
