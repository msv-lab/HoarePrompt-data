Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split; `n` is the first integer from `l1`; `k` is now equal to `k` right-shifted by 1 bit (which is equivalent to `k // 2`); `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16]; `c` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k` by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2 and taking the integer part of the result. All other variables remain unchanged.
