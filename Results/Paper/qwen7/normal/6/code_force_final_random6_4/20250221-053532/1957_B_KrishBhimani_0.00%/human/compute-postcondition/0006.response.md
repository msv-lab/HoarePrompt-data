The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `i`. Since the loop condition is `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is non-zero for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `k` is initially set to `k0` (which is equal to the integer converted from the second element of `l1`), we need to ensure that `k` is non-zero.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\): This state does not affect the loop condition `k`.
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string: This state does not directly affect the loop condition `k`.
- `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`: This state does not directly affect the loop condition `k`.
- `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`: For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be non-zero.
- `k0` is equal to `k`: This state does not directly affect the loop condition `k`.
- `arr` is an empty list: This state does not directly affect the loop condition `k`.
- `i` is 0: This state does not directly affect the loop condition `k`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be non-zero, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
