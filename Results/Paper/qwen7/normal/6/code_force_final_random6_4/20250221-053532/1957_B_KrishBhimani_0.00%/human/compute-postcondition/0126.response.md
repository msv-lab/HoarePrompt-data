Output State: **`k` is now half of its original value, `arr` contains the integers `i` and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is still half of its original value, `arr` still contains the integers `i` and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.
