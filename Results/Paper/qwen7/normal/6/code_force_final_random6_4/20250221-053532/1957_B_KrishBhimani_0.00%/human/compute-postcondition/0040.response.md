Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0], `c` is 1, and either `c` is equal to `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `c` is not equal to `n - 1` and no changes occur.**
