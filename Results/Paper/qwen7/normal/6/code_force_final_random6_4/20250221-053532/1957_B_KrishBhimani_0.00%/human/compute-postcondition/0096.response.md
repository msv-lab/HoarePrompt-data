Output State: **`i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, and `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `1 << i` evaluates to `1 << 0`, which is 1. Therefore, the list `ans` now contains `[1, k0 - 1, 1]`. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged.
