Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It returns a result based on the values of n and k for each test case.**

- For each test case, the function checks if the given integers n and k meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2⋅10^5).
- The function then performs some operation or calculation using n and k and returns the result for that particular test case.
