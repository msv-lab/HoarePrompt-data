Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `arr` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`
   - `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`
   - `c` is 1
   - `ans` contains `[1 << i]`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr` that have not been processed.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is one of the elements in `arr`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one of the values from the array `arr`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `arr`.
   - The variable `c` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
   - The variable `ans` will contain the result of the previous iteration, and it will be updated based on the new value of `i` if the loop body modifies it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `k` remains 0 (unchanged)
- `arr` remains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]` (unchanged)
- `i` is now the next element in `arr` after the previous `i`
- `c` remains 1 (unchanged)
- `ans` will contain `[1 << i]` where `i` is the next element in `arr`

Since `i` was one of the elements in `arr` and the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in the array.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 1, and `ans` contains [1 << i]**
