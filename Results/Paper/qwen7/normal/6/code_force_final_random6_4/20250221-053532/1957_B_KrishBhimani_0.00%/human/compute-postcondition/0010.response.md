Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is non-zero, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0, `i` is 0, and `k` is updated to its current value if it is odd; otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
