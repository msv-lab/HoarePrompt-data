Output State: **`k` is an odd integer divided by 2 (using bitwise right shift), and `arr` contains the integer `i`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k` by 1 bit. This operation effectively divides `k` by 2. Since `k` was initially an odd integer, dividing it by 2 results in an even integer. However, the problem specifies to include the initial condition that `k` was an odd integer before the operation, and the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
