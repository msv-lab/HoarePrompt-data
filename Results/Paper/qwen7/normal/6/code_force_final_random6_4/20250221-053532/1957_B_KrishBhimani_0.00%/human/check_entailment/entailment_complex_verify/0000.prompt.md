You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0

                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1

            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more inputs to process. After all iterations, `i` will be 255 (since the maximum value for `k` is \(10^9\) and the binary representation of numbers up to \(10^9\) has 29 bits, but `i` starts from 0 and goes up to 255 in the given code). The value of `t` will remain within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `l1` will contain the last input split into a list of strings. `n` and `k` will be the last values read from the input. `k0` will be equal to the last value of `k`. `arr` will contain a list of integers from 0 to 255, as it iterates through all possible bit positions for the maximum `k`. `ans` will be constructed based on the values in `arr`, with each element being either a power of 2 or zero, depending on whether the corresponding bit in `k` was set. The list `ans` will be padded with zeros to ensure its length matches `n`. The final `ans` list will contain the calculated values based on the last `k0` and the constructed `arr`.
    #
    #The exact content of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `k` for the last input, but it will follow the pattern described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representation of \( k \). Specifically, it appends powers of 2 to `ans` corresponding to the bits set in \( k \), and pads the list with zeros to match the length \( n \). Finally, it prints the constructed list `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the constructed sequence results in a binary representation with the maximum number of 1s.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 4
  3 7
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 1 2
  1 3 3
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  0 0 4
  0 4 4
  ```

In the first test case, the program outputs `[0, 0, 4]`, but the bitwise OR of `[0, 0, 4]` is `4` (which is `100` in binary), and it does not maximize the number of 1s. The correct output should be `[1, 1, 2]`, where the bitwise OR is `3` (which is `111` in binary).

In the second test case, the program outputs `[0, 4, 4]`, but the bitwise OR of `[0, 4, 4]` is `4` (which is `100` in binary), and it does not maximize the number of 1s. The correct output should be `[1, 3, 3]`, where the bitwise OR is `7` (which is `111` in binary).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the constructed sequence, making it incorrect.
