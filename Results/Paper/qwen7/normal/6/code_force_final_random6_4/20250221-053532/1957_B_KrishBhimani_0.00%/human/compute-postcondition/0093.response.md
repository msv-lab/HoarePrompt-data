Postcondition: `i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, and `ans` is a list with the element `1` appended to it. If `c` equals `n - 1`, then `i` is set to 0, `c` is incremented by 1, and `ans` becomes a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1]` where the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c` does not equal `n - 1`, then no changes are made to `i`, `c`, or `ans`.
