Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The state before the loop starts indicates that `i` is 8.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. Therefore, `i` will take on the values 0, 1, 3, and 4.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`. Since `i` is currently 8, it does not match any of the elements in `arr` (which are 0, 1, 3, and 4).

5. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`. We need to change the value of `i` to one of these elements.

Given the constraints and the requirement to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, we can set `i` to any of the values in `arr` (0, 1, 3, or 4).

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `i` is one of the values in `arr`.

**State: **`i` is 0 (or 1, 3, or 4), `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
