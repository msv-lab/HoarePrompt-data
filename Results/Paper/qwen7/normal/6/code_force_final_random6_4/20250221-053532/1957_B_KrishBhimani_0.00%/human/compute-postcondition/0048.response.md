`c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is 2, so after the increment, `c` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0], and `c` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0], `c` is 3.**
