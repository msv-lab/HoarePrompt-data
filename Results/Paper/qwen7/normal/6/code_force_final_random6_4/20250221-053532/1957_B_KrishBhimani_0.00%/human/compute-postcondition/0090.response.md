Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each value in `arr`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: 
   - `i` takes on each value from the list `arr` in sequence.
   - `c` increments by 1 for each iteration (though this is not part of the loop head).
   - `ans` appends a new element `1 << i` to the list.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` must be one of the values in `arr`.
   - `c` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is a list with a new element `1 << i` appended to it.

5. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take the next value in `arr`.
   - Since `c` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, the value of `i` should be the next value in the list `arr`.
   - The list `ans` should have the next element `1 << i` appended to it.

Given that `i` was one of the values in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was the last value in `arr` that was processed. The next value in `arr` would be the first value in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` should be the first value in `arr`, which is `0`.
- `c` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `ans` should have the next element `1 << 0` (which is `1`) appended to it.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, `ans` is a list with elements `[1 << 0]` appended to it**.

To express it more clearly:
- `i` is 0.
- `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1.
- `ans` is a list with the element `1` appended to it.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, `ans` is a list with the element `1` appended to it**.
