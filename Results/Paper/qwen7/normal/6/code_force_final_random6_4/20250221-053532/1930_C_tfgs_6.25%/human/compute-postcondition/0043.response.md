Output State: `j` is equal to `adv`, `adv` must be at least 1, `ans` is a list containing the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `adv` because the loop increments `j` in each iteration. The loop appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans` for each iteration of `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`. Therefore, `ans` will contain the values starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`.
