Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list, `cnt` is decreased by `adv` if `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is equal to `adv` if `i + 1 > 0`, `ans` contains the sequence starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1` if `i + 1 > 0`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i + 1 > 0`. If `i + 1` is not greater than 0, `cnt`, `ans`, `j`, and `counter[a[i + 1]]` remain unchanged.
