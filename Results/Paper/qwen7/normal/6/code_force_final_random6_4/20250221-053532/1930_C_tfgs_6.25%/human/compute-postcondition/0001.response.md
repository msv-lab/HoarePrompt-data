Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is not affected by this operation.
