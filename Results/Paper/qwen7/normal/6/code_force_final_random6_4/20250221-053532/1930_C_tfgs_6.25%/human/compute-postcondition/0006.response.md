Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[1]` is 3 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since `n` is not specified to change, we assume it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
