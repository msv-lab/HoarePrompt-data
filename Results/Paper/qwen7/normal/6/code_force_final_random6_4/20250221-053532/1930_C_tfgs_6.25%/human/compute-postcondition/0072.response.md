Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `cnt`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1.
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `cnt`).

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - The list `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `cnt` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `cnt - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1, `cnt` must be greater than 1**
