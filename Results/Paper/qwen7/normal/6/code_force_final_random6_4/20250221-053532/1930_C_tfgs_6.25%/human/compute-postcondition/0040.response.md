Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < adv`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `adv` must be at least 1
   - `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - 3`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `adv` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `adv` remains at least 1 (unchanged).
   - The list `ans` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `adv` must be at least 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - 3`**
