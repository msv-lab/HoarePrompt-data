Output State: **`i` is 0; `a[0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 1. Since `a[0]` does not exist initially, it is assumed to be 0 before the operation. After the operation, `a[0]` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
