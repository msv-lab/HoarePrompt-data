Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` in the range `range(adv)`. This means the loop variable `j` and the value `adv` are the key elements we need to consider.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `adv`.
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `adv - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `adv` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop variable `j`, so they remain unchanged.
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `j` becomes `adv`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `adv` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - cnt` and must still be greater than 0.
- `j` is now `adv`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv`**.
