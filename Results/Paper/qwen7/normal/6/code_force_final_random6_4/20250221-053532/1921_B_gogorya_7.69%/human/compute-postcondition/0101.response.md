Output State: **`hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `res` is equal to `res` plus 1 if `s1[i+1]` is '1' and `s2[i+1]` is '0', otherwise `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change.**

Explanation: The code `hd -= 1` decreases the value of `hd` by 1. The value of `res` remains unchanged because there is no operation that affects it in this line of code. The condition for changing `res` (i.e., `s1[i+1]` is '1' and `s2[i+1]` is '0') is still valid and will be checked later in the program.
