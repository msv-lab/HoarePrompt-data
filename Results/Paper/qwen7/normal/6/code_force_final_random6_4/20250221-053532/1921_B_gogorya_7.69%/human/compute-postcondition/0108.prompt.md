Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2 + 3)`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the input string `s2`, `i` is 6, `s2` is the input string from user input, `a1` is the count of '1's in the new `s1`, `res` is updated to `abs(a1 - a2)`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` is 1, assuming the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is true. If the condition is false, `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `hd` remains equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` is equal to `res` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1 if it was greater than 0 and `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', and `res` is equal to `res` plus 1 if `s1[i+1]` is '1' and `s2[i+1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
