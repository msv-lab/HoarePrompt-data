The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The variables `hd`, `n`, `res`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, `s1`, and `s2` retain their original values.

Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 4` (or `a1 - a2 - 6` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 2`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
