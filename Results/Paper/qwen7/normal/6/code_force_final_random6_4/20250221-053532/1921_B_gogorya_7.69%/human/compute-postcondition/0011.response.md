Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `hd` is greater than 0 - 1**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. Since `hd` was initially greater than 0, after subtracting 1, `hd` is now greater than 0 but by 1 less than its original value. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
