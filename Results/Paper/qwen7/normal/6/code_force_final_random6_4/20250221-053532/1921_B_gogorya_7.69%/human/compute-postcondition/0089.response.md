Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `res` is 1, and the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `hd`, `s1`, and `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
