Output State: **`hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `res` is equal to `res` plus 1 if `s1[i+1]` is '1' and `s2[i+1]` is '0', otherwise `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change. We continue the loop.**

This means that the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and move to the next iteration without changing the values of `hd` and `res`. The conditions for updating `res` based on the values of `s1[i+1]` and `s2[i+1]` remain the same.
