Output State: **`hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1 and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the only effect is that the loop will continue without executing the remaining code in the current iteration. The value of `hd` remains as it was initially, but it is implied that it has already been decremented by 1 before reaching the `continue` statement.
