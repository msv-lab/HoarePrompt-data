Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is a string entered by the user.**

The code `s2 = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `s2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
