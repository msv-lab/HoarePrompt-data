Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1.
- `res` is equal to `res` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
- The loop does not directly modify `hd` or `res` within the loop head itself; these modifications occur based on conditions inside the loop body.

### Conditions Inside the Loop Body
- If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `hd` will remain unchanged unless it is explicitly modified within the loop body (which it isn't).
- `res` will be incremented by 1 if the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is met during the current iteration.

Since no explicit changes to `hd` or `res` are mentioned in the loop head, we assume `hd` remains unchanged and `res` could potentially be incremented.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. **Check Condition for `res`**: The condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` needs to be checked for the new value of `i`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `hd` remains unchanged.
- `res` will be incremented by 1 if the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is true for the new value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` is equal to `res` plus 1 if `s1[i+1]` is '1' and `s2[i+1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged and `res` does not change.**
