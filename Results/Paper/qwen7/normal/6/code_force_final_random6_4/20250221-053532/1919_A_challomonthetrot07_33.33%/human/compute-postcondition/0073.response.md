Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through a loop or external mechanism, where for each test case, it takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (both between 1 and 10^9) and returns a value based on some unspecified logic.**

Given the constraints, the function processes each pair of integers `(a, b)` within the specified ranges and returns a result for each test case. However, without additional details on the logic inside the function, the exact nature of the return value cannot be specified beyond this general description.
