State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `T`.
2. For the loop to execute, `T` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 because `range(T)` generates values from 0 to T-1.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as specified by the `range(T)` function.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `T` (to ensure it is within the specified range) and `i` (which is already set to 0).
