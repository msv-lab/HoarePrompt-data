Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\) and \(T > 3\). This means `T` is any integer between 4 and 1000, inclusive.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, assigned the values from the input split by space.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement will output the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Alice**
