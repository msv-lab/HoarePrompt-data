Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is even.
- Either `a` is odd or `b` is even.
- `a` is greater than `b`.

The print statement is simply `print('Bob')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, or `T`, it will simply print the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
