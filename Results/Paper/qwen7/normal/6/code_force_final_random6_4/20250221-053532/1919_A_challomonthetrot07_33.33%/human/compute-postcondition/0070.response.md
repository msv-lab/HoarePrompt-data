Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\) and \(T > 3\), `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers from the input. If `a` equals `b`, the function does nothing to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, if `a` equals 1 or `b` equals 1, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. In all cases, `a` and `b` retain their original values from the input.**
