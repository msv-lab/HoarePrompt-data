Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, considering optimal play.
2. The provided solution checks several conditions to determine the winner:
   - If \(a == b\), Bob wins.
   - If \(a == 1\), Alice wins.
   - If \(b == 1\), Bob wins.
   - If \(a \% 2 == 1\), Bob wins.
   - If \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 1\), Alice wins.
   - If \(a > b\), Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.
3. Let's analyze these conditions:
   - When \(a == b\), the game state is symmetric, and the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move after the other player's turn.
   - When \(a == 1\), Alice cannot make a valid move since she would need to remove another coin, which is not possible.
   - When \(b == 1\), Bob cannot make a valid move for the same reason.
   - When \(a \% 2 == 1\), Alice will always end up with an odd number of coins, and Bob will eventually be left with an even number of coins, allowing him to force a win.
   - When \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 1\), Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, giving her the advantage.
   - When \(a > b\), Bob can always force a win by making strategic moves.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.

Given the logical flow and the conditions provided, the program correctly implements the rules of the game and outputs the correct winners for all test cases as per the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
