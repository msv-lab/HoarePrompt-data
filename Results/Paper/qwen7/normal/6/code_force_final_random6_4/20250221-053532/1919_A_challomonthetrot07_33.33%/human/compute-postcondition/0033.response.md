Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a` is even or odd, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and if `a` is odd, `i` is set to 1. If `a` is even, `a` becomes divisible by 2 while `b` remains not divisible by 2, or `a` becomes odd or `b` becomes even, and if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains unchanged, otherwise `a` is set to 0.
