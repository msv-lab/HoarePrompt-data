Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1, and `a` is even, and in the end, `a` is divisible by 2 while `b` is not divisible by 2, or `a` is odd or `b` is even, and if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains unchanged, otherwise `a` is set to 0.
