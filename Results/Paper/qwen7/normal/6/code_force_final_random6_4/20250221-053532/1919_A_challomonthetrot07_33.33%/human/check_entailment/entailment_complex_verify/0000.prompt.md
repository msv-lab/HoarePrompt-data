You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:

        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, i is equal to T, a and b are integers from the input. The values of a and b do not change throughout the loop executions unless they meet specific conditions inside the loop. Specifically, if a equals b, a is set to b; if a is even, a is halved; if a is odd, i is set to 1; if b equals 1, b remains 1; if a is greater than b, a remains unchanged; if a is less than or equal to b, a is set to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it determines whether "Alice" or "Bob" wins based on specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\), and prints the winner for each case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for both players when `a` and `b` are not equal and both are greater than 1. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

Consider the test case `(a, b) = (3, 3)`. According to the problem description, both players should play optimally. Here’s how the game would proceed if both players play optimally:

1. Alice starts with `a = 3` and `b = 3`.
2. Alice can either swap or not swap. If she swaps, `a = 3` and `b = 3`, and it becomes Bob's turn.
3. Bob now has `a = 3` and `b = 3`. He can either swap or not swap. If he swaps, `a = 3` and `b = 3`, and it becomes Alice's turn again.
4. This process repeats until one of them cannot make a valid move.

Since both players can always swap back and forth without losing, the game will continue indefinitely unless one of them makes a mistake. However, the provided program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case because it does not account for the possibility of an infinite loop or the optimal strategy when both players have an odd number of coins.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
