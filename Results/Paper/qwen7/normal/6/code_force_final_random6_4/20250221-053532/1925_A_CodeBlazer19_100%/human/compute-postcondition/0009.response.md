Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is the integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

Let's break it down:
1. `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` will take the first `k` characters from the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
2. This substring is then repeated `n` times.

Since `k` is the second integer from the input, let's denote it as `k_value`. And since `n` is the integer from the input, let's denote it as `n_value`.

So, the print statement will output a string consisting of the first `k_value` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n_value` times.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k_value] * n_value**
