Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `i` remains 0. The new variables `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values of the respective inputs.
