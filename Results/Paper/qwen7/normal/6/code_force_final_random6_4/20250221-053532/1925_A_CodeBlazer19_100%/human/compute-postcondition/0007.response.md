Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must still be greater than 1 (and thus greater than 0).

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input**
