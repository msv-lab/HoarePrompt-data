Output State: **The program returns the difference between index j and i plus one, which is the distance between two consecutive elements in the list `arr` that are equal.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is the length of `arr` - 1
- `j` is the length of `arr` - 2
- `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`
- `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` - 1

Since `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is the length of `arr` - 1, it implies that `arr[i]` is the last element in the list. Therefore, `arr[i + 1]` does not exist because `i + 1` would be out of bounds. However, since `j` is the second last index (length of `arr` - 2) and `j` is not equal to `i` (which is the last index), `arr[j]` and `arr[j + 1]` must be the two consecutive elements that are equal.

Thus, the expression `j - i + 1` calculates the distance (or difference in indices) between these two consecutive equal elements. Given the values of `i` and `j`, the program returns this distance.
