Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The function returns 0 if no two consecutive equal elements are found. If two consecutive equal elements are found, it returns the difference between their indices plus one. If no such elements exist, it returns 1.**
