Output State: **`i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was either 0 or 1, and `j` was either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2. After incrementing `i` by 1, if `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code does not affect `j`. Therefore, `i` is now 1 and `j` is still the length of `arr` - 1.
