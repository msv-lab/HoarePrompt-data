Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
   - The loop has not terminated because `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must be true.
   - We need to check the possible values of `i` and the corresponding `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` to ensure the loop condition is met.

4. **Analyze the two cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2.
     - If `i` is 1, then `arr[1]` should be equal to `arr[2]` for the loop to execute.
   - **Case 2**: `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
     - If `i` is 0, then `arr[0]` should be equal to `arr[1]` for the loop to execute.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - In both cases, the loop will execute the first time if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true.

Given the current state, we need to ensure that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` holds true for the loop to execute the first time. Since the exact values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are not provided, we can only state the condition that needs to be met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
