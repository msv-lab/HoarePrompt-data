Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, the count of '1's in `s` is either odd or even, and `s` either contains exactly one occurrence of '11' or does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11'.**

This output state reflects that `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
