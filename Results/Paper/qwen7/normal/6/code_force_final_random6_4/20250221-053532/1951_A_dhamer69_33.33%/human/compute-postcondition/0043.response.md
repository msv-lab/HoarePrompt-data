Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `s` is updated to a new input string from the user.
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
