Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`, `count_1` is calculated as the count of '1's in `s`. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**
