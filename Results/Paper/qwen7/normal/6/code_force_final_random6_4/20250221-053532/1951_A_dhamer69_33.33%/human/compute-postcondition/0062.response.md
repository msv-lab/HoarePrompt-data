Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`. If `n` equals 2, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `count_1` is calculated as the count of '1's in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains unchanged. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.
