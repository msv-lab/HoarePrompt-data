Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`, and `s` is updated to a new input string from the user. If the new string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', no changes are made to `count_1`. Otherwise, `count_1` remains unchanged.**
