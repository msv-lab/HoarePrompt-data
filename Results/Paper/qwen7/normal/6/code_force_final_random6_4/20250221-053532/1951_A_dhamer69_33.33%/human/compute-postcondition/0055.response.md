Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, `s` is the new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the new input string `s`. Since the if condition `s == '00'` does not change the values of the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
