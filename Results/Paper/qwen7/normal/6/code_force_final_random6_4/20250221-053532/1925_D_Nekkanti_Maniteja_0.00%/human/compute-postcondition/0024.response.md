Output State: **i is m-1, k is greater than 0, u is an integer entered by the user, v is an integer entered by the user, f is an integer entered by the user, a is the sum of all f values entered over the course of the loop's iterations, s is the sum of c * i * c * m + c * a for each i from 0 to m-1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `m-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` will retain their most recent values entered during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations of the loop. The variable `s` will be the sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each `i` from `0` to `m-1`.
