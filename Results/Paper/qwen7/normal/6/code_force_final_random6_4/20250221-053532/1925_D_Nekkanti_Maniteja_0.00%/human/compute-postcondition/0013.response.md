Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `u` is an integer entered by the user, `v` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is `a` plus `f`**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. Additionally, the value of `a` is updated to be `a` plus `f`. Since the initial value of `a` is not specified, it is represented as `a` plus `f`.
