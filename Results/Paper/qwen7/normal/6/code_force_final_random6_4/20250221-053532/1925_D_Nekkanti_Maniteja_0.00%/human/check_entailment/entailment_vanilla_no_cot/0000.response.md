Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The solution does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to compute `s` is incorrect.
2. **Misunderstanding of Problem Requirements**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the expected value can be computed using a simple linear combination of the initial friendship values and the number of excursions. This is not accurate.
3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The use of modular inverse (`pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`) is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions.
4. **Incorrect Summation Logic**: The summation logic inside the loop is flawed. It does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.

### Correct Solution Outline:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. Calculate the probability of picking a friend pair in any given excursion.
2. Use linearity of expectation to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Initialize variables
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        expected_value = 0
        
        # Process each friendship pair
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            expected_value += f * (total_pairs / m)
        
        # Calculate the expected value after k excursions
        expected_value *= k
        expected_value %= MOD
        
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions by leveraging the linearity of expectation.
