The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). For each test case, it reads pairs of integers \( u \) and \( v \) along with an integer \( f \), sums up all \( f \) values, and calculates a value \( s \) based on these inputs and a constant \( c \). Finally, it prints \( s \mod M \) for each test case, where \( M = 10^9 + 7 \).
