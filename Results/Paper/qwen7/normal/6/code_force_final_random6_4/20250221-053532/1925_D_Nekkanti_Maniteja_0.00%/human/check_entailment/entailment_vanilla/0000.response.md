Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions respectively.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).

2. **Calculation of Modular Inverse:**
   - The expression `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` calculates the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - This is used later in the calculation to ensure all operations are performed under modulo \(M\).

3. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program then iterates over the `m` friend pairs and sums up the friendship values into `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The main part of the logic lies in the loop where it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The formula used is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` seems to be an attempt to calculate the contribution of each excursion to the expected value.
     - `c * a` adds the initial sum of friendship values to the expected value.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(M\).

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect for calculating the expected value.
   - The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over excursions.
   - The current implementation does not correctly model the expected increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - While the use of modular arithmetic is correct, the way it is applied in the context of the problem is flawed.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The correct approach involves:

1. Calculating the probability of picking each pair in each excursion.
2. Considering the increase in friendship values for pairs that are already friends.

Given the complexity, a more detailed and accurate solution would involve dynamic programming or combinatorial methods to correctly model the expected value.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
