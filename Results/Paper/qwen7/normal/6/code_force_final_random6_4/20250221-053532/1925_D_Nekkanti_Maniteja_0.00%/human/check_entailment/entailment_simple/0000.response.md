Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each case.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\) which is used for modulo operations to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.
3. **Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is necessary because the problem involves counting the number of ways to choose pairs of children, and the modular inverse is used in the calculation of expected values.
4. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of the expected friendship values.
5. **Friendship Value Sum**: The variable `a` is used to accumulate the sum of all friendship values `f_i` provided in the input. This sum is crucial for calculating the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.
6. **Expected Value Calculation**: The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it updates `s` using the formula \(s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a\). This formula accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the expected number of times each pair is chosen.
7. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the result of `s % M`, ensuring the output is within the required bounds.

Given the logical steps and the correct use of mathematical formulas, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
