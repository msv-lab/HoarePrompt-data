Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5. Additionally, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is m-1, k is greater than 0, u is an integer entered by the user, v is an integer entered by the user, f is an integer entered by the user, a is the sum of all f values entered over the course of the loop's iterations, s is the sum of c * i * c * m + c * a for each i from 0 to m-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `m`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is the sum of all `f` values obtained from the split inputs over all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is less than `m`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as inputs during the loop executions.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will still be less than `m` because the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `m` and increments `i` within each iteration. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop. The variable `s` accumulates the value of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration from 0 to `m-1`. Therefore, `s` will be the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `m-1`. The variable `a` retains its value as it is the sum of all `f` values provided as inputs during the loop executions and is not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
