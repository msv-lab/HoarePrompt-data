Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is 0, `a` is increased by `f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers input from the user.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been updated by adding the value of `f` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
