Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `m-1`.
   - `k` is greater than 0 (though `k` is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged).
   - `u` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `v` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `f` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the course of the loop's iterations.
   - `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from `m-1` and will increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m`.
   - The value of `int(input())` will be the new limit for the loop, which means it will be read as the first input for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `m`.
- The new limit for the loop, which is the first input, will be the value of `int(input())` for the next iteration.

Since the other variables (`k`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `s`) are not affected by the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `m`, the new limit for the loop is the value of `int(input())`**.
