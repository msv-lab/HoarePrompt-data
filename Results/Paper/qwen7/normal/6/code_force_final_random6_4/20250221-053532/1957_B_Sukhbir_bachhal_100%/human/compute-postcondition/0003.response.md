Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, with `n` not equal to 0. The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `position` is 0.**

In this code, `position` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the only change is that `position` is now 0.
