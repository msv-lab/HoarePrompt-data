Output State: **The program returns a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `t`**.

This is because the loop counts the number of right shifts needed until `n` (which starts as `t`) becomes 0. Each right shift reduces the number of bits in the binary representation of `t` by 1. Since the loop returns `position - 1`, it effectively returns the number of bits in `t` minus 1.
