Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is 1, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1**.

Explanation: The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Initially, `position` is 0, so after executing this line, `position` becomes 1. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
