Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and `n` is the length of the list; `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `freq` with a length of `n + 1` and fills it with zeros. This does not affect the values of `arr` or `n`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `arr` and `n` remain unchanged, and `freq` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
