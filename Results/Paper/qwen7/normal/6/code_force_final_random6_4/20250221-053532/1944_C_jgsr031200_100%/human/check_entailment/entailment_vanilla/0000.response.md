### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to her array `c`, and delete it from `a`. Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it. The game ends when `a` is empty. The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If there are at least two distinct elements in `a`, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by picking different elements in her turns.
   - If there is only one distinct element in `a`, the MEX will be 1 because Bob will always pick that element.
   - If there are no repeated elements, the MEX will be the count of unique elements plus one.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal MEX.
   - It uses a function `func_1` which is not defined in the code snippet.
   - The code attempts to count frequencies of elements in `arr` but does not handle the game logic properly.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Count the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - Determine the number of unique elements.
   - Based on the number of unique elements, decide the MEX:
     - If there are at least two unique elements, the MEX will be 2.
     - If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be 1.
     - If there are no repeated elements, the MEX will be the number of unique elements plus one.

### Correct Implementation:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = [0] * n
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    # Count the number of unique elements
    unique_elements = sum(1 for f in freq if f > 0)
    
    # Determine the MEX
    if unique_elements >= 2:
        mex = 2
    elif unique_elements == 1:
        mex = 1
    else:
        mex = 0
    
    print(mex)
```

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
