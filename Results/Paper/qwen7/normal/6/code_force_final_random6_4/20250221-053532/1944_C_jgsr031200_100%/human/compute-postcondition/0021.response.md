Based on the initial state provided:

- `cou` is 1
- `i` remains 0
- `n` must be greater than -1 because the condition `freq[i] == 1` was met in the if statement
- Either `cou` is equal to 2 or `freq[i]` is equal to 0

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- The print statement is `print(i)`
- The value of `i` is explicitly stated as remaining 0

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
