Output State: The frequency list `freq` will have been incremented for each unique value present in `arr`. Specifically, for each integer \(a_i\) in `arr`, the corresponding index \(a_i\) in `freq` will be incremented by the total number of occurrences of \(a_i\) in `arr`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `freq` list will show how many times each unique number from `arr` appeared in the list.
