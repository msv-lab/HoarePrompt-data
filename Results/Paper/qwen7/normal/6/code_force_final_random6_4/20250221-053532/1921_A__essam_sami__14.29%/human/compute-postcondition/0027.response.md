Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `x` is \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\), `n` is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\)**.

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `e` and `f`. This updates the values of `e` and `f`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` are preserved, and the expressions for `x` and `n` remain valid as they depend on the original values of `c`, `d`, `g`, `h`, `a`, and `b`.
