Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it does not affect the print statement directly).
- `steps` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers from the input splits.
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n)
```

This will print the value of `n`, which is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).

Output: **(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2**
