Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `d` is the second integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `x` is (c - g)² + (d - h)², `n` is (a - e)² + (b - f)². If `x` is greater than `n`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
