Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `x` is \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\), `n` is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), `a` is updated to the first integer from the input split, `b` is updated to the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `c` and `d`. This means `c` and `d` now hold the values of the first and second integers from the input respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
