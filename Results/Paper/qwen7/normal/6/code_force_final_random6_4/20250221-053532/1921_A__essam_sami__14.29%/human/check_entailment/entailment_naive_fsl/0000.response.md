Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller distance, which does not necessarily represent the side length of the square. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the points will give us the side lengths. We need to compare these differences to identify the side length of the square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())

        # Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates
        x_diff1 = abs(a - c)
        y_diff1 = abs(b - d)
        x_diff2 = abs(e - g)
        y_diff2 = abs(f - h)

        # Find the maximum difference in x or y coordinates
        side_length = max(x_diff1, y_diff1, x_diff2, y_diff2)

        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected program identifies the side length of the square by comparing the differences in x and y coordinates and then calculates the area correctly.
