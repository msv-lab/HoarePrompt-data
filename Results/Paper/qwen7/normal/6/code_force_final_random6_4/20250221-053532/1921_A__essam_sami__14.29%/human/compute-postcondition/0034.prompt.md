Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input representing the number of square coordinate sets.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`, and if `x` is greater than `n`, then no change occurs. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `d` is the second integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `x` is (c - g)² + (d - h)², `n` is (a - e)² + (b - f)². If `x` is greater than `n`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is the first integer from the current input split, `h` is the second integer from the current input split, `x` is \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\), `n` is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\). If \(x > n\), then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
