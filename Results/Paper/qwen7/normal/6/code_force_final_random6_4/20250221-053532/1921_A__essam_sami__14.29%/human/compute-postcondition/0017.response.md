Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `d` is the second integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them, converting each to an integer and assigning them to `e` and `f` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
