Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions for `t` and `steps` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `steps` is still 1. The values of `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.
