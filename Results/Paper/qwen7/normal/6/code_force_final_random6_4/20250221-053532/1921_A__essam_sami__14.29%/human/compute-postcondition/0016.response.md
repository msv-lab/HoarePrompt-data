Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `d` is the second integer from the input split.**

The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `c` and `d` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
