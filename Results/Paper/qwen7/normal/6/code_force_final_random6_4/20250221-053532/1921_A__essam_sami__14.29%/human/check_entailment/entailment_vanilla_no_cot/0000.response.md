Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to calculate the distance between pairs of points and compare them to identify the side length of the square. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for all possible pairs of points that could form the sides of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, you need to ensure that the distances between the points are consistent with the properties of a square. Specifically, you should check all pairs of points to identify which pairs are the sides of the square and which pair is the diagonal. For a square, the diagonal is âˆš2 times the side length.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = math.sqrt((points[i][0] - points[j][0])**2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1])**2)
                distances.append(dist)
        
        # Identify the side length of the square
        side_length = min(distances)
        # The diagonal of the square is sqrt(2) times the side length
        diagonal_length = math.sqrt(2) * side_length
        
        # Verify that the calculated diagonal matches the expected value
        if math.isclose(max(distances), diagonal_length):
            area = side_length ** 2
            print(area)
        else:
            print("Invalid input")
```

This corrected program ensures that the distances between all pairs of points are calculated and then identifies the side length and diagonal of the square correctly.
