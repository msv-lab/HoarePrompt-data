Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `x` is \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\), `n` is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), `g` is the first integer from the current input split, `h` is the second integer from the current input split.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them, assigning the first integer to `g` and the second integer to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
