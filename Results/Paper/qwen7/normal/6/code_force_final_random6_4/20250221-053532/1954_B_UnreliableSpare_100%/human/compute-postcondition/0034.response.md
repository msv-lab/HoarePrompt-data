Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.**

The code updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is unknown before the operation, the only thing we know for sure is that `ans` is now the smaller of its original value and `cnt`. All other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
