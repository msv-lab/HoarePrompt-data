Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `flag` remains False.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. If the condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` is ever met, the loop breaks and sets `flag` to `False`. Since the loop has executed all its iterations, it means that either the condition was never met for any `i` (which would leave `flag` as `True`), but based on the given conditions, `flag` is set to `False` if the condition is met at any point. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` will still be greater than 1 (as it was initially), and `flag` will remain `False`.
