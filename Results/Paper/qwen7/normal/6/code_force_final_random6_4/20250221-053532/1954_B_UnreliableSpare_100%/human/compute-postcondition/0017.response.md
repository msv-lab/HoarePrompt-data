Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are updated or reassigned by the `break` statement, their initial states remain unchanged.
