Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the value at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since the initial values of `i`, `n`, `arr`, `val`, and `cnt` are not specified, the only change is that `ans` is now set to the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
