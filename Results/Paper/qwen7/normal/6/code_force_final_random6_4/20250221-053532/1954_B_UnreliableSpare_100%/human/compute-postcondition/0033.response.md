Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `cnt` is equal to `cnt` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously unknown, it is now updated to its original value plus one. The conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
