Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` is False**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `flag`. Since `flag` was already `False` in the initial state, its value does not change. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `arr[2] != arr[1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
