Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `flag` remains False, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `val`. If the value at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and if `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than 1. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
