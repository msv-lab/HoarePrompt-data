Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the value at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`; `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `arr`, or `val`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged, and only `cnt` is now explicitly set to 0.
