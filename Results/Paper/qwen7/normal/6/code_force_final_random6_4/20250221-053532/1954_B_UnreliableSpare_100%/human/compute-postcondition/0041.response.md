Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is `i + 1`, `cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ans` or `i`, but it initializes `cnt` to 0. The conditions that `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and `i` is `i + 1`, remain valid. Additionally, the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is also preserved.
