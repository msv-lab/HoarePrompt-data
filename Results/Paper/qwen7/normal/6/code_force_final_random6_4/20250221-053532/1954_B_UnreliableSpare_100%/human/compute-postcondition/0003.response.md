Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts at 1 (since the loop is defined as `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` remains as it is in the initial state.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the condition `1 < n` must be true for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial state:
- `flag` is True.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the final state should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
