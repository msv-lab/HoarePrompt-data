Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of identical elements but still has sections where the condition `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` holds true. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove without properly identifying and handling these sections.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program should output `1` because removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) would make the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful anymore. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify this scenario and outputs `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify and count the minimum number of elements to remove in cases where the array is not entirely uniform but still has sections where the condition holds true.
