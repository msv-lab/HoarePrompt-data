Postcondition: `a` and `b` are swapped, meaning `a` is now equal to the original value of `b` and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. `n` remains greater than 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to the original value of `a`, and `a` has been updated to the original value of `b`.
