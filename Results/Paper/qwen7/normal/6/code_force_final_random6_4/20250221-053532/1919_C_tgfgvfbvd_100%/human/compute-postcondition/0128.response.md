Output State: **`a` is now the value of `b`, `b` is now the value of `a`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `c` is increased by 1 if the condition does not hold true.**

This means that the values of `a` and `b` have swapped. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `c` is incremented by 1 only if the condition (which is not specified here) does not hold true.
