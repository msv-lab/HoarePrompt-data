Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n` and converts it to an integer. Since no other variables or states are mentioned in the initial state, only the value of `n` changes. The output state is therefore that `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
