Output State: **`x` is `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are swapped, and `c` is increased by 1; `b` is equal to `l[x]`**.

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. Since `x` is `n` and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` now holds the value of `l[n]`. The other conditions (swapping of `a` and `b`, and incrementing `c`) remain unchanged.
