Output State: **`c` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity.**

The code initializes `c` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
