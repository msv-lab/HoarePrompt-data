Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` is positive infinity.**

The code assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, or the condition of `x` within the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `y` is now positive infinity.
