Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; `b` is a list with its last element being the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` to list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. After executing the code, `i` increments by 1 (becoming 2), and the element at index 1 of list `lit` is appended to list `b`. The conditions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `n` remains greater than 0.
