Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i] > y`, then `a` remains unchanged and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `lit[i] <= y` or `lit[i] <= x`, then list `b` now includes the value `lit[i]`, assuming `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x` are true.
