Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being positive infinity, or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `a` is updated to contain the element `lit[i]` with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is updated to the maximum of `y` and `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then `a` remains unchanged and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x` and `lit[i] > y`.
