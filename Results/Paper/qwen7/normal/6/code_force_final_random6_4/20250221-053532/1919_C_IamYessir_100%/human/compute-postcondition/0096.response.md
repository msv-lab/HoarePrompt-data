Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; list `a` has its last element updated to `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `lit[i]` refers to `lit[1]`. After appending, `i` will increment by 1 (assuming `i` is incremented after the append operation), making `i` equal to 2. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
