Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, if `a` is an empty list, `x` is not infinity. If `a` is not an empty list, `y` is assigned the last element of list `a`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`.
