Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `b` must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 2, `x` is the last element of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is the last element of `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty). If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
