Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; `a` is a list with its last element being the value of `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. After executing the code, `i` increments by 1 (since lists are typically indexed starting from 0), making `i` equal to 2. The value of `lit[1]` is appended to `a`. The conditions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
