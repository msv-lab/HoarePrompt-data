Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`, and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, and `b` is a list that now contains the element `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `lit[i]` is `lit[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
