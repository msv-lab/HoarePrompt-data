Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index 1, and `a` is a list that now contains the element `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a.append(lit[i])` appends `lit[1]` to `a`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1 due to the nature of list appending in loops or subsequent code, making `i` equal to 2. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `b`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
