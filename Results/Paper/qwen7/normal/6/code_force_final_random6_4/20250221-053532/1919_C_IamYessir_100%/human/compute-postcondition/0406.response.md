Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is not an empty list, the current value of `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[0]` is now an element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[0]` is appended to `a`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
