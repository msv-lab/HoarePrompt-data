Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list with an unspecified number of elements, and `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. The values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged. Since the length and content of list `b` are not specified, `y` is simply set to the last element of `b`.
