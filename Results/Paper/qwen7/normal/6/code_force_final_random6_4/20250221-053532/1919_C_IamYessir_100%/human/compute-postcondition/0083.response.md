Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
