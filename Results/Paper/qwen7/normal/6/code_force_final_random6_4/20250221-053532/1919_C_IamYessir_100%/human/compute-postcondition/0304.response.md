Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with one more element than before and the last element is `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `lit[i]` will be the third or fourth element of the list `lit`. This new element is added to the end of `a`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
