Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`
   - `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`
   - `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index 1
   - `a` is a list that either has its last element updated to `lit[1]` or appended with `lit[1]` depending on whether `x >= lit[1]` or `lit[1] > y` respectively.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is only dependent on the loop counter `i` and the initial condition given, which is `n` being greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 3
   - `n` is still greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
   - The values of `x`, `y`, `b`, and `a` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined by the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
