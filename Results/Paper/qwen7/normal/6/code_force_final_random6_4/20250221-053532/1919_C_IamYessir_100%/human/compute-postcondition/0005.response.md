Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (as per the `range(0, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
