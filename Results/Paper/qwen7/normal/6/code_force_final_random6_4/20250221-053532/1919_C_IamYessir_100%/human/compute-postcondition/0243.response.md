Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`, and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y`, and either `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, in which case `b` is a list that now contains the element `lit[i]`, or there is no such `i` and `b` remains unchanged.
