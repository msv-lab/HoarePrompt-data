Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `y` remains unchanged unless `x` is compared with `lit[i]` and `b` is considered, which is not done in this code snippet.
