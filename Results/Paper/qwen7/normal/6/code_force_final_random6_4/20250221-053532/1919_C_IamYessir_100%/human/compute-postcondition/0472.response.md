Output State: **`i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list containing the element `lit[3]`; `b` is empty, therefore `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[3]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `b` is empty, `x` remains infinity and `y` remains infinity.
