Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[0]`. After executing the if-else block, `b` is a list that either contains the element `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` and `y >= lit[i] > x`, or `b` remains unchanged if no such `i` satisfies the condition, and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `y`.
