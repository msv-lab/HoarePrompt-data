Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and now has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `lit[i]` will be the third or fourth element of the list `lit`. This new element is appended to `a`, making it have one more element. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of the updated list `a` or remains `float('inf')` if `a` was empty before appending. The values of `n`, `y`, and the other conditions remain unchanged.
