Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial States**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the State After One Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

5. **Final State Before the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
