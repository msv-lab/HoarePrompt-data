Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, and `a` is a list with its last element being `a[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[3]` since `i` is 3) to the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
