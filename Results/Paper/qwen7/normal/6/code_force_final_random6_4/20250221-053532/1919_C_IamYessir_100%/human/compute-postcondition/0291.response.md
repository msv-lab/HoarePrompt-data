Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The line `y = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This overrides the previous definition of `y` based on the conditions involving `x`, `lit[i]`, and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
