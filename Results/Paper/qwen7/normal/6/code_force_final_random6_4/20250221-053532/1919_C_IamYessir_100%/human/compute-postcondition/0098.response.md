Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, and list `b` has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 (i.e., `a[1]`) is appended to list `b`. After appending, `i` should be incremented to 2 (assuming the context of the program requires `i` to be incremented after appending). All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
