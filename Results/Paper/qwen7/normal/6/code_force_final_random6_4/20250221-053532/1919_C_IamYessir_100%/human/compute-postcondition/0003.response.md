Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `lit` remain unchanged from the initial state.
