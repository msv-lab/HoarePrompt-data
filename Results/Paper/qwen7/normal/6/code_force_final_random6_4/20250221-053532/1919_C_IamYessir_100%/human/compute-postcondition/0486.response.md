Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `x` will be the last element of list `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), and `y` will be the last element of list `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty). The list `a` will contain all elements from `lit` that are less than or equal to the current `y` and greater than or equal to the current `x`, and the list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are greater than the current `x` and less than or equal to the current `y`. If there are no such elements, their respective lists will remain empty.
