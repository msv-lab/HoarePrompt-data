Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and `a` is a list with an additional element `lit[1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` was initially 1, `a.append(lit[i])` appends `lit[1]` to `a`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
