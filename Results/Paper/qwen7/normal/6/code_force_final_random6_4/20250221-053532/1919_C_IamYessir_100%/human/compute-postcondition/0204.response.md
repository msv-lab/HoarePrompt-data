Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; if the length of list `b` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[0]`; `b` is a list with one additional element which is `lit[i]` (since `i` is 0, the element added is `lit[0]`).**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, the element added to `b` is `lit[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
