Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)` + 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cp` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cp = 0` initializes the variable `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `b`, `s`, `n`, or `lit`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
