Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added.
   - `x` is the last element of list `a`.
   - `y` is the last element of list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, or infinity if `b` is empty.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, the next value of `i` will be 2 or 3 respectively.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 2 (if it was 1) or 3 (if it was 2), and `n` must remain the same or be adjusted accordingly.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 2; if `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as there is no information suggesting it needs to change.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be either 2 or 3.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The lists `a` and `b`, and the values `x` and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, or infinity if `b` is empty**.
