Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, if `a` is an empty list, `x` is not infinity. If `a` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of list `a`, and `x` is either not infinity and less than `y`, or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` after appending `lit[0]` to `a`.
