Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b`'s last element is set to `a[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
