Output State: **`test` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `t` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and now `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `test` and `t` remain unchanged.
