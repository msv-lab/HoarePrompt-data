You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `test` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `test` ≤ 1000. The variable `t` is now equal to `test - 1`, meaning it has gone through all the iterations from 0 to `test - 1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are the integers provided as input, and the if-else condition is evaluated. Depending on whether `a + b` is even or odd, either "Bob" or "Alice" is printed, but the values of `a` and `b` themselves do not change.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases through a loop where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each `t`, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it processes `a` and `b` based on the value of `t` and returns a result accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
