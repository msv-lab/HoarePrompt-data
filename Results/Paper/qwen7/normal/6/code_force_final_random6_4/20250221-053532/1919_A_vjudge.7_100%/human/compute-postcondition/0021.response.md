Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `test` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `test` ≤ 1000. The variable `t` is now equal to `test - 1`, meaning it has gone through all the iterations from 0 to `test - 1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are the integers provided as input, and the if-else condition is evaluated. Depending on whether `a + b` is even or odd, either "Bob" or "Alice" is printed, but the values of `a` and `b` themselves do not change.**

This means that after the loop completes, `t` will be `test - 1`, and the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers entered during the last iteration of the loop.
