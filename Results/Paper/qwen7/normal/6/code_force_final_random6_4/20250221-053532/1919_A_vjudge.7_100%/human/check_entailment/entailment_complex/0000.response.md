Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here’s the detailed analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The game involves alternating moves where each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key insight is that the player who faces a situation where the sum of the coins in both wallets is even will always lose if both players play optimally.

2. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - If \(a + b\) is even, the player whose turn it is will always be forced into a situation where the sum becomes odd after their move. This means the opponent can always force the sum back to even on their next turn.
   - Conversely, if \(a + b\) is odd, the player whose turn it is can always make a move that keeps the sum odd, forcing the opponent into a losing position.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The code correctly takes the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It then checks if \(a + b\) is even or odd using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers within the specified range (1 ≤ \(a, b\) ≤ 10^9).
   - The logic correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum without modifying the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution accurately implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
