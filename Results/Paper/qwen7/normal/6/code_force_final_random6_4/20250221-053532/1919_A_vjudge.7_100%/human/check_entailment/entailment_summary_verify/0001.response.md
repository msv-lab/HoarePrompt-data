### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins because he can always force the sum to become odd after his turn, ensuring Alice eventually faces an even sum and thus loses.
   - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the sum to become even after her turn, ensuring Bob eventually faces an odd sum and thus loses.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
     - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the sum, the program correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's implementation. The program assumes that the parity of the sum of the coins at the start of the game determines the winner. This is not entirely accurate because the game involves a series of moves where players can swap wallets, which changes the state of the game.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Test Case 1:** `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - Initial sum: `1 + 1 = 2` (even)
  - Alice starts and does not swap wallets, then Bob cannot make a valid move (since Alice's wallet is now empty), so Bob wins.

- **Test Case 2:** `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - Initial sum: `1 + 4 = 5` (odd)
  - Alice swaps wallets, then Bob removes a coin, and the process continues until Alice cannot make a valid move, so Alice wins.

The program's logic fails to account for the dynamic nature of the game, specifically the ability to swap wallets, which can change the parity of the sum during the game. The program only checks the initial sum, which is insufficient to determine the winner accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players. The program only checks the initial parity of the sum of the coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
