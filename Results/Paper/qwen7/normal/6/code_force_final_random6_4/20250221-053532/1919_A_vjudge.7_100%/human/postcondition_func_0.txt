The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
