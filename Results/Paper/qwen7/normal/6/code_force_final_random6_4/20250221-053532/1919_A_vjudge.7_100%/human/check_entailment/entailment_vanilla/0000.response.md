### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins because he can always force the sum to become odd after his turn, ensuring Alice eventually faces an even sum and thus loses.
   - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the sum to become even after her turn, ensuring Bob eventually faces an odd sum and thus loses.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
     - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the sum, the program correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
