### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Special Character Calculation**: For each test case, the program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This logic is correct.

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making the characters at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., special. This construction is valid and will always produce a string with exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the constructed string `s` is less than 200 characters long before printing "YES" and the string. Since the pattern `'AAB'` repeats, the maximum length of `s` when `n` is even and `n <= 50` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and redundant but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

5. **Output Format**: The program follows the specified output format correctly, printing "NO" if no suitable string exists and "YES" followed by the constructed string if a suitable string is found.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
