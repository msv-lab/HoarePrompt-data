Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, then no change is made to `n` and `t`. If `n` is even, then `s` is set to 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Additionally, if the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is 200 or more.
