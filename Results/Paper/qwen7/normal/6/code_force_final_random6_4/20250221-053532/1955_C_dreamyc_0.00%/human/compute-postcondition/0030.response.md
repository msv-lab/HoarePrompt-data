Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, and `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()` pops the first element from the left side of the deque `nums` and assigns it to `a`, then pops the last element from the right side of the deque `nums` and assigns it to `b`. The length of `nums` decreases by two after these operations. All other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.
