Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque adjusted according to the if condition, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque adjusted according to the if condition, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `nums` is updated to append the value of `a` to the left end of the deque.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the value of `a` to the left end of the deque `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
