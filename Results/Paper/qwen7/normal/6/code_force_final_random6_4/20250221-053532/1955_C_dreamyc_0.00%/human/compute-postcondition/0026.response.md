Output State: **`ans` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `b` is less than or equal to 0, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.**

Explanation: The initial state of `ans` is either 0 or 1. The code increments `ans` by 1, so `ans` becomes 1 (since adding 1 to 0 gives 1). All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `b`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
