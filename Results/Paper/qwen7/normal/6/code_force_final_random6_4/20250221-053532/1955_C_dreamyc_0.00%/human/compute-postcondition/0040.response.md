Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with one fewer element, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is increased by the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the right end of the deque `nums`. This increases the number of elements in `nums` by one. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `b` is appended to the deque, it means that `b` is now the last element of the deque again, but the number of elements in the deque has increased by one.
