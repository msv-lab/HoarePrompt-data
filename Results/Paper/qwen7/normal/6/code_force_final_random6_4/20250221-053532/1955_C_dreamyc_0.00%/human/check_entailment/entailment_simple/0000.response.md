Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durability of each ship `nums`.

2. **Deque Usage**: The program uses a deque to efficiently manage the first and last elements of the list of ships' durabilities. This is appropriate because deques allow efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Attack Simulation**: The function `func_1` simulates the Kraken's attacks by repeatedly removing the first and last elements of the deque, reducing their durability by the minimum of the two values, and updating the count of sunk ships (`ans`). The logic handles cases where the durability of the ships is reduced to zero, and the ship is considered sunk.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where the number of attacks `k` is sufficient to sink all ships or where fewer attacks than necessary are made. Specifically:
   - If `k` is still non-zero and there is only one ship left, the program checks if the remaining ship can be sunk by the remaining attacks. If so, it increments the count of sunk ships by 1.
   - If `k` is zero or the deque has more than one element, it returns the current count of sunk ships without further modifications.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of sunk ships for each test case based on the provided examples and the logic implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
