Postcondition: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times x\), `k` is reduced by \(2 \times x\), `a` is adjusted by subtracting the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
