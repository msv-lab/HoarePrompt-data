You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least two elements in `nums`. After all iterations, `ans` will be the total count of times the condition `a <= 0` or `b <= 0` was met, which increments `ans` by 1. `k` will be reduced by the sum of all the `2 * x` values where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` in each iteration. `nums` will eventually become a deque with either 0 or 1 element left, depending on whether the last two elements were reduced to zero or not. If the last two elements were reduced to zero, `ans` will be incremented by 2 for each such pair, and `nums` will be empty. If one of the last two elements was reduced to zero but the other was not, `ans` will be incremented by 1, and `nums` will contain the non-zero element. If neither of the last two elements was reduced to zero, `ans` will not be incremented, and `nums` will contain the two non-zero elements.
    #
    #In summary, the final state will have `ans` being the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` being the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` being either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it.
    #State: `ans` is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` is the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` is either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements. Additionally, `k` is zero or `len(nums)` is greater than 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest pair of elements, reducing them by their minimum value, and decrementing `k` accordingly. This process continues until `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`. The function counts the number of times any element in the current pair is reduced to zero and returns this count plus one if the last remaining element (if any) can still be reduced by `k`, otherwise it simply returns the count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the durability of the last ship is reduced to zero but the first ship still has durability remaining. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input:

```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

According to the problem description, the sequence of events would be:
1. First attack: Durability of the first ship becomes 0, `nums = [2, 4, 3]`.
2. Second attack: Durability of the last ship becomes 2, `nums = [2, 4, 2]`.
3. Third attack: Durability of the first ship becomes 1, `nums = [1, 4, 2]`.
4. Fourth attack: Durability of the last ship becomes 1, `nums = [1, 4, 1]`.
5. Fifth attack: Durability of the first ship becomes 0, `nums = [4, 1]`.

In this case, the program would incorrectly count only 2 ships as sunk because it breaks the loop prematurely. However, according to the problem description, all 4 ships should be counted as sunk. Therefore, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.
