Output State: **`a` is `a - x - 2 * x`, `b` is `b - x - 2 * x`, `k` is `k - 2 * x`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `a` is `a - x` and `b` is `b - x`.
- The variable `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- The code `k -= 2 * x` means `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
- Therefore, `a` and `b` each decrease by an additional `2 * x`, and `k` decreases by `2 * x`.

So, the updated values are:
- `a` is now `a - x - 2 * x`.
- `b` is now `b - x - 2 * x`.
- `k` is now `k - 2 * x`.
