To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `k` and `len(nums) >= 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `k`**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero (`k and`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` has been modified based on the loop body. However, without seeing the exact modifications, we know that `k` must still be non-zero for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition `len(nums) >= 2`**:
   - The loop continues as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` has been modified to be a deque with two fewer elements (`nums` is a deque with two fewer elements).

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`k`**: Since the loop requires `k` to be non-zero, we need to ensure that `k` is non-zero. If `k` was zeroed out during the loop body, we need to set it back to a non-zero value.
- **`len(nums)`**: We need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2. Given that `nums` has two fewer elements at the end of the previous iteration, `len(nums)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `len(nums)` such that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied.

**State:**
- `k` must be non-zero.
- `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `k` or the exact length of `nums` after the loop body, but we know they must meet the above conditions.

**Final State:**
State: **`ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `len(nums)` must be at least 2**
