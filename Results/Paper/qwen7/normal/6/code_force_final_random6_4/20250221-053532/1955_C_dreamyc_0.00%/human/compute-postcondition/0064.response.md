Postcondition: **`ans` is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` is the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` is either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements. Additionally, `k` is zero or `len(nums)` is greater than 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums)` is 1.**
