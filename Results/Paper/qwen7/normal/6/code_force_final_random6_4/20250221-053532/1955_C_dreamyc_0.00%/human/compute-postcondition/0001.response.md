Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables or their states. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
