Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque adjusted according to the if condition, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque adjusted according to the if condition, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The current value of `a` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * x, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, and `a` and `b` are updated to `a - x` and `b - x` respectively if `k` is updated.
