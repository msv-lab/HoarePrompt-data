Output State: **`a` is the first element removed from `nums` using `popleft()`, `b` is the last element removed from `nums` using `pop()`**.

This means that the first element from the left (using `popleft()`) of the list `nums` is now stored in `a`, and the last element from the right (using `pop()`) of the list `nums` is now stored in `b`. All other elements and properties of `nums` remain unchanged from the initial state.
