Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

The code assigns the value of `min(a, b)` to `x`. Since `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque and `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is now the minimum of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
