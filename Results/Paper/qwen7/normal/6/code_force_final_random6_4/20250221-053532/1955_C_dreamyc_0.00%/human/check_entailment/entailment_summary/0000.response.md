Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships.
2. The `func_1` function uses a deque to efficiently manage the removal of the first and last elements.
3. The logic inside the while loop accurately reflects the problem statement:
   - It removes the smallest pair of elements from the front and back of the deque.
   - It reduces these elements by their minimum value.
   - It decrements `k` by twice the minimum value.
   - It updates the count of sunk ships (`ans`) when an element is reduced to zero.
4. After the main loop, it checks if there is a single remaining element and if `k` is sufficient to sink it.
5. The overall logic and implementation match the problem description and the provided examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
