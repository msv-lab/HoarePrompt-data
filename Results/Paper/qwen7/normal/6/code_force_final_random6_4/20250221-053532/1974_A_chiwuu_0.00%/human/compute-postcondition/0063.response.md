Postcondition: `t1` is `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t2` is `a - t1`, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is `t + t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
