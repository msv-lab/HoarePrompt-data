Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Initial Calculation**: The variable `t` is initially set to \(2b\). This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so \(2b\) represents the total number of cells occupied by all 2x2 icons.

3. **Adjusting `t` Based on Divisibility**: 
   - If \(t\) is not divisible by 5, it is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5. This step ensures that the number of cells is adjusted to fit the grid layout.
   - This part is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and we need to ensure that the total number of cells is a multiple of 15.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as \(t \times 15 - 4b\). This represents the remaining number of cells after placing all 2x2 icons on the screens.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to \(a\), it means there are enough cells to place all 1x1 icons, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than \(a\), it means there are not enough cells to place all 1x1 icons, and additional screens are needed.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program calculates how many more screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by checking if the remaining cells (`t1`) can be evenly divided by 15, and if not, it rounds up to the next whole number of screens.
   - This step ensures that any leftover cells from the previous calculations are accounted for by adding additional screens.

6. **Output**: The final value of `t` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.

Correctness: **True**
