You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\). It calculates an initial value for \(t\) as \(b \times 2\), then modifies \(t\) based on certain conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). Specifically, it checks if \(t\) is divisible by 5; if not, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 5. It then adjusts \(t\) further based on the difference between \(a\) and a calculated value \(t1\). If \(t1\) is less than \(a\), \(t\) is increased by the appropriate amount to make up for the shortfall, again rounding up to the nearest multiple of 15 if necessary. Finally, it prints the resulting value of \(t\) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

- For the input `12 4`, the expected output is `2`. This is because we can place 4 icons of size `2x2` in 1 screen, and the remaining 8 icons of size `1x1` can be placed in another screen. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Let's analyze the program's logic:
1. It calculates `t = b * 2` which represents the total number of `2x2` icons in terms of `1x1` cells.
2. It then checks if `t` is divisible by 5 and adjusts `t` accordingly.
3. It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons.
4. It then checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of `1x1` icons) and sets `t` accordingly.
5. Finally, it calculates `t2` and adjusts `t` further.

This logic does not correctly handle the placement of `1x1` icons in the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons. A more accurate approach would involve calculating the number of full `2x2` icons that can fit in each screen and then determining how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining `1x1` icons.

For instance, in the case of `12 4`, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed, leading to an incorrect output.
