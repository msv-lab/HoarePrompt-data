Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers, `x` and `y`.

2. **Initial Calculation**: 
   - `t = b * 2`: This initializes `t` to twice the number of 2x2 icons (`y`).
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5`. Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1`. This step ensures that `t` is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5, which is a crucial part of the calculation since each screen can hold 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

3. **Further Adjustment**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates how many cells are available on `t` screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2 = a - t1` represents the remaining cells needed to place all 1x1 icons.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`. This ensures that any remaining cells are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 15.

4. **Output**: The final value of `t` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens seems to be flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent adjustment steps do not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons on the screens.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the test case `(1, 1)`, the expected output is `1`. The program should place the 2x2 icon on one screen and the 1x1 icon on the same screen, requiring only one screen.
- For the test case `(7, 2)`, the expected output is `1`. The 2x2 icons take up 8 cells (2 * 4), leaving 7 cells for the 1x1 icons, which can fit on the same screen.
- For the test case `(12, 4)`, the expected output is `2`. The 2x2 icons take up 8 cells, and the remaining 4 cells can fit the 1x1 icons, but since there are 12 1x1 icons, they need to be placed on two screens.

### Conclusion:
The provided logic does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. The program fails to properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons and the constraints of the grid layout.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
