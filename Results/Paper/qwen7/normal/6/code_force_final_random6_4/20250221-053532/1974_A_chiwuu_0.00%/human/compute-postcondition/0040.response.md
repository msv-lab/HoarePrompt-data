Output State: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns the variable `t` to its current value, which is `b * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
