Output State: **`t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `t2` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`) remain in their original states.
