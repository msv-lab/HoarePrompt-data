Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`**

Explanation: The code calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition for `t` (whether it is `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`) still holds true.
