Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial States**:
   - `t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.
4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**.
