Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to `t // 5 + 1`. Given that `t` was initially `b * 2`, the new value of `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
