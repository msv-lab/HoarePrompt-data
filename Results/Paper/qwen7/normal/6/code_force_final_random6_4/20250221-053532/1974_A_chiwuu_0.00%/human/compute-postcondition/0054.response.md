Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`**

Explanation: The code `t = t // 5` updates the value of `t` by performing integer division of `t` by 5. Given that `t` was previously defined as `b * 2`, the new value of `t` is now `b * 2 // 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
