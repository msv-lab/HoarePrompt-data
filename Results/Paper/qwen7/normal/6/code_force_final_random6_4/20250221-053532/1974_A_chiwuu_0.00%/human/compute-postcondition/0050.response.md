Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. The values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are updated accordingly. The initial conditions for `t` and `t1` are still valid, but since `t` is defined as `b * 2`, it remains dependent on the value of `b`.
