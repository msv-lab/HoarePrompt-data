Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values of `D`; `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element; `aa[m:]` must have at least one element; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next pair of elements from `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `E[out_aa]` by 1 while keeping the other conditions and values intact.
