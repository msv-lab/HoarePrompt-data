Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input is now assigned to `nabors`, the output state reflects that `nabors` is the input integer within the specified range. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
