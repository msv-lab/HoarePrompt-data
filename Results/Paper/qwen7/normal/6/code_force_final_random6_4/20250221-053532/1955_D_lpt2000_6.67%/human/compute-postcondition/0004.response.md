Output State: **`nabors` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `aa` is a list of integers from the input, `bb` is a list of integers from the new input.**

Explanation: The code `bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a new line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `bb`. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `aa` remain unchanged from their initial states.
