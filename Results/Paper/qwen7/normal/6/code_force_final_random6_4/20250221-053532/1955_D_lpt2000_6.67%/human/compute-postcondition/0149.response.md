Postcondition: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise unchanged. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

This means that regardless of the condition in the if statement, `E[out_aa]` is always decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met (i.e., `C[in_aa]` does not equal `D[in_aa]`), then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
