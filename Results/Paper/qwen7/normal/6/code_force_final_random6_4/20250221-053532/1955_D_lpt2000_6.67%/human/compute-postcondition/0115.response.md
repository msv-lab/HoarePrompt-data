Output State: **Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and either `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, or `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is not increased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `E[in_aa]` by 1. The postconditions related to `aa`, `D`, `out_aa`, and `E` remain unchanged as no operations affecting these conditions were performed. Therefore, the only change is that `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1.
