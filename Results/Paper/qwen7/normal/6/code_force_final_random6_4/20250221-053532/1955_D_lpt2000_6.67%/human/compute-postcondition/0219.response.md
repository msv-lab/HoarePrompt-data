Postcondition: **`aa[m:]` must contain at least two elements, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and in both cases (`D[out_aa] > 0` and `D[out_aa] <= 0`), `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Additionally, if `D[out_aa] > 0`, then either `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, or `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged. This holds true whether `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]` or not.**
