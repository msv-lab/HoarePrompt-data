Postcondition: `fnd` is 1 if `tot` (sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - m`; the current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0.
