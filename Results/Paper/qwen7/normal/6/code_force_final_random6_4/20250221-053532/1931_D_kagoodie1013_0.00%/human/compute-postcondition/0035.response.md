Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is not defined, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `mod_x_map` as an empty dictionary. This means that `mod_x_map` no longer contains any key-value pairs from its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
