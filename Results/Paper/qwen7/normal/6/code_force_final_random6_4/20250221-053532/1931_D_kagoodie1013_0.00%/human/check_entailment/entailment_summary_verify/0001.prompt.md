You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, it calculates the count value based on the remainders of the numbers in the list when divided by `x` and `y`. It then appends these count values to a list `results`. After processing all tuples, the function returns the `results` list, which contains the count values for each test case. Additionally, the function maintains two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the overall frequencies of remainders when all numbers in the lists from all test cases are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It iterates through the input to extract the necessary parameters for each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to process each test case and calculate the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes counters and dictionaries to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the remainder when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses these remainders to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the entire input and splits it into parts for each test case.
   - The extraction of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` is done correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary variables.
   - It iterates through each element in the array and calculates the required remainders.
   - It uses these remainders to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
     - `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` correctly adds the counts from the maps.
     - The updates to the maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) are also correct.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for finding beautiful pairs is correct. The program correctly processes each test case and computes the number of beautiful pairs as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
