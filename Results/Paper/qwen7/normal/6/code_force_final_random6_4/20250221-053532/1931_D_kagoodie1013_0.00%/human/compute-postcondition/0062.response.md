Output State: `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map` values plus all `mod_y_map` values, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `count` will be the total sum of all counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. The `num` variable will hold the last element processed in the array `arr`, `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` will reflect the remainders of this last element when divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each possible remainder for divisions by `x` and `y` across all elements of `arr`.
