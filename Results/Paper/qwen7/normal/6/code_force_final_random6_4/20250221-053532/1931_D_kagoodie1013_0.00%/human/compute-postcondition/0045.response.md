Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is 0
   - `num` is the first element of `arr`
   - `mod_x_key` is `num % x`
   - `mod_x_map` is {'num % x': 1}
   - `mod_y_map` is {'num % y': 1}
   - `results` is [0]

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop, after processing the first element, `num` will be set to the second element of `arr`.
   - `arr` will now be the remaining elements of the original array (i.e., all elements except the first one).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `count` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `num` changes to the second element of `arr`.
   - `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_map` remain the same as they are derived from the current `num` but are not updated within the loop body based on the given information.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` remain the same unless the loop body updates them, which is not specified here.
   - `results` remains [0] as no new results are added or modified in the loop body based on the given information.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is {'num % x': 1}, `mod_y_map` is {'num % y': 1}, `results` is [0]**
