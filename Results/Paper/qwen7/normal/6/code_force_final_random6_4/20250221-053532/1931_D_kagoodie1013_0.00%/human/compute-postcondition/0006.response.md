Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is the variable that will take each element from the list `arr` during each iteration.
   - `arr` is the list that contains the elements to be iterated over.

3. **Understand the initial state given**:
   - `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `count` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant objects**:
   - Since `num` is the variable that will change during each iteration, it needs to be initialized to the first element of `arr`.
   - `arr` should be a non-empty list to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `arr` must be a non-empty list.
   - `num` must be initialized to the first element of `arr`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
