Output State: **`mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `mod_x_map`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, and `count` is 0.
