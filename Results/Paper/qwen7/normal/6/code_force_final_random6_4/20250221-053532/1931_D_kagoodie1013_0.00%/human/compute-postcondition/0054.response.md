Output State: **`count` is 3, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `-num % x`, `mod_x_map` is updated based on the new value of `-num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % y`, `results` is [0]**

Explanation: The code updates `mod_x` to be `-num % x`. Since the value of `num` is the third element of `arr`, and `mod_x_key` was previously `num % x`, it now becomes `-num % x`. Similarly, `mod_x_map` is updated based on the new value of `-num % x`. The value of `num % y` remains unchanged, so `mod_y_key` stays the same, and `mod_y_map` is updated based on the new value of `num % y`. The value of `count` and `results` remain unchanged.
