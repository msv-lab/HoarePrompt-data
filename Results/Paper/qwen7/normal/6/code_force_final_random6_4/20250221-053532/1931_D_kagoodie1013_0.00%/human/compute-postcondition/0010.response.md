Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % x` to `mod_x_key`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
