Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`**

Explanation: The code assigns `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. This updates the value of `mod_y_key` based on the current value of `num` and `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
