Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `(n, x, y, arr)` which are unpacked from each tuple in `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple must have four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `test_cases` is a list, it must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute. Therefore, `test_cases` must have at least one element.
   - Each tuple in `test_cases` must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers, so for each tuple, `arr` must be a list of length `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.
- Each tuple in `test_cases` must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `arr` in each tuple must be a list of length `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements (n, x, y, arr), and arr in each tuple must be a list of length n.**
