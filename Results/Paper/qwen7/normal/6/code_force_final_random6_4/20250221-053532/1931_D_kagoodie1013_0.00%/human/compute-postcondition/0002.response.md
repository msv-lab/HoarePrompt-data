State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from test_cases**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple in `test_cases`. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
- For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `test_cases` that matches the structure `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- The variable `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, as the loop itself does not modify this variable directly; it only uses the tuple structure from `test_cases`.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one valid tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)` for the loop to execute.
