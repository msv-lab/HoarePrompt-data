Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % x` to the variable `mod_x_key`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `num`, `mod_y`, or `count`. The value of `mod_x_key` is now determined by the expression `num % x`. All other variables retain their previous states.
