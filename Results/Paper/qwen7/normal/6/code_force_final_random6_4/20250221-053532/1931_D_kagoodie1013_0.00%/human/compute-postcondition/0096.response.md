Output State: `results` is a list containing the sum of `count` values from all iterations of the loop; `count` is the total sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` values accumulated over all iterations; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` across all `arr` lists and the value is the total count of how many times that remainder appeared across all iterations; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` across all `arr` lists and the value is the total count of how many times that remainder appeared across all iterations; `num`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` are not defined outside the loop as they are local variables within each iteration.
