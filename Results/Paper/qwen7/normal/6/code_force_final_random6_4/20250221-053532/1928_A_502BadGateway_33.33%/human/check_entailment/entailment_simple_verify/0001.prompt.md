You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if the value of b is even, otherwise it returns 'no'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can transform a given rectangle \(a \times b\) into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - If the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be recombined to form a new distinct rectangle, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it is "No".

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(a, b)` with the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the dimension `b` is even. If `b` is even, it returns 'yes', otherwise 'no'.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even.
   - It does not consider all possible ways to split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and whether those smaller rectangles can form a new distinct rectangle.
   - The function does not handle cases where splitting along the `a` dimension could result in forming a new distinct rectangle.

4. **Examples from the Problem Statement**:
   - **Test Case 2 (2x1)**: The function correctly returns "No" because the only way to split a 2x1 rectangle is into two 1x1 rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.
   - **Test Case 3 (2x6)**: The function incorrectly returns "No" because splitting the 2x6 rectangle into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranging them can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is distinct from the original 2x6 rectangle.
   - **Test Case 5 (2x2)**: The function correctly returns "Yes" because splitting the 2x2 rectangle into two 1x2 rectangles and rearranging them can form a 1x4 rectangle, which is distinct from the original 2x2 rectangle.
   - **Test Case 7 (6x3)**: The function incorrectly returns "No" because splitting the 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles and rearranging them can form a 3x6 rectangle, which is distinct from the original 6x3 rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The given function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient for determining if a new distinct rectangle can be formed.
