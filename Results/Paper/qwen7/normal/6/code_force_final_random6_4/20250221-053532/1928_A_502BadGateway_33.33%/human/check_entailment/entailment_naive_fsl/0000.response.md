Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this logic is insufficient to cover all cases.

For example, consider the test case \(2 \times 6\):
- According to the problem description, cutting the \(2 \times 6\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and then forming a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle is valid.
- However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 'no' because \(6\) is even.

Similarly, for the test case \(2 \times 4\):
- Cutting the \(2 \times 4\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and then forming a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle is valid.
- The current implementation would also incorrectly return 'no' because \(4\) is even.

To correctly solve this problem, the function needs to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is greater than 1 and if the other dimension is even. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a > 1 and b % 2 == 0 or b > 1 and a % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This corrected function will correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
