Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions `a` and `b`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following cases:

1. If either `a` or `b` is 1, then no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, then Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into smaller rectangles and reassembling them.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes")

```

This version correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
