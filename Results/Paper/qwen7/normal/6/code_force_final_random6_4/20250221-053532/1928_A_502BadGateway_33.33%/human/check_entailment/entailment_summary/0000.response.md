Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem statement, Bob needs to check if he can form another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The current implementation only checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

To properly solve the problem, we need to consider the following points:
1. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, then the only possible resulting rectangles are the original ones (since cutting a \(1 \times x\) or \(x \times 1\) rectangle results in \(1 \times 1\) rectangles).
2. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1, then the rectangle can always be divided into two smaller rectangles, and by rearranging them, a new rectangle can be formed unless the original rectangle was already a square (i.e., \(a = b\)).

Given the above points, the correct logic should be:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, return 'No'.
- If \(a = b\), return 'No'.
- Otherwise, return 'Yes'.

The current implementation only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
