The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of operations), `operations` (a list of tuples specifying the type of operation and the value to operate with), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the queries). It performs the specified operations on an initially empty array and then calculates the result for each query based on the final state of the array. The result is a list containing the queried values, where each value is determined by the formula `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, with `k` being each element from the `queries` list in order.
