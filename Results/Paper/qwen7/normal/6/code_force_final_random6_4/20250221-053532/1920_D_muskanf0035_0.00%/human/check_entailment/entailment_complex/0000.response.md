Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly processes the operations and queries as per the problem statement.
   - It handles both types of operations (appending a single integer and appending multiple copies of the current array).
   - The logic for calculating the result for each query using `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` is correct. This ensures that even if the array grows exponentially due to the second type of operation, the correct position can be found using modular arithmetic.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly reads the input for each test case.
   - It processes the operations and queries for each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - The output is formatted correctly and printed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. All operations and queries are handled appropriately, and the output matches the expected behavior as described in the example.

Correctness: **True**
