### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `array = []`: Initializes an empty list.
   - `result = []`: Initializes an empty list to store results.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The function iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` by repeating its current content `value` times.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, it calculates the index using modulo operation: `(k - 1) % len(array)`.
   - This ensures that the index wraps around the array, which is necessary when the array size exceeds the query index.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries respectively.
   - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
   - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.

2. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - Prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly handles both types of operations:
  - Appending a single value (type 1).
  - Extending the array by repeating its current content (type 2).
- The query handling in `func_1` uses the modulo operation to handle large indices efficiently, ensuring that the index wraps around the array size.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes each test case and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. When the array is extended by repeating its current content (type 2 operation), the length of the array can grow exponentially. This means that the array can become extremely large, and the modulo operation might not always return the correct index for large queries.

Consider the following example:
- Initial array: `[1]`
- Operation: `2 2` (append 2 copies of the current array)
- Array becomes: `[1, 1]`
- Operation: `2 2` (append 2 copies of the current array)
- Array becomes: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Query: `5` (index 5 should wrap around, but the array only has 4 elements)

In this case, the modulo operation `(5 - 1) % 4` will return `0`, which is incorrect because the 5th element does not exist in the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is not correct because the modulo operation does not handle the case where the array has been extended multiple times and the query index exceeds the current length of the array. The correct approach would involve maintaining a record of the cumulative lengths of the array after each operation and using this information to calculate the correct index for each query.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the potential mismatch between the actual length of the array and the index calculation using the modulo operation.
