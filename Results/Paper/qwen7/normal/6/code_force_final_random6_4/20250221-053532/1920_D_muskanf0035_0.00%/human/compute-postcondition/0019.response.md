Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by splitting and converting the input string using map function, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` after all iterations of the loop have completed.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should still be greater than 0 (indicating there are more inputs to process), `n` and `q` will be the last set of input integers received from the respective inputs, `queries` will be the last list of integers obtained from splitting and mapping the input string, and `result` will be the final return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` computed over all the iterations.
