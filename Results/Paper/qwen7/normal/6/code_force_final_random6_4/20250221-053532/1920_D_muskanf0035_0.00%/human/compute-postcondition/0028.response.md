Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of operations), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value to operate with), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the queries). For each query, it calculates the value at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` in the array after performing all specified operations and returns a list of these calculated values.**

This means the function processes a series of operations on an initially empty array, where each operation can either append a specific integer or duplicate the entire array a certain number of times. After applying all operations, it then answers a series of queries by returning the value at specified positions in the final array.
