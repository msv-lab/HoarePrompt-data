Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of lists formed by the map and split input strings, each sublist contains integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list of lists named `operations`. Each element in this list is generated by taking an input line, splitting it into parts, and converting those parts into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation is repeated `n` times, where `n` is the first input integer. After executing this code, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `q` remains unchanged (as it is only mentioned to be an input integer without being reassigned), and `queries` is a list containing `n` sublists, each of which contains integers from the subsequent inputs. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
