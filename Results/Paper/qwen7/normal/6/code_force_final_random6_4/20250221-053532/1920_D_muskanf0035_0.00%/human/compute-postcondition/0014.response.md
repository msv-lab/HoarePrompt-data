Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by the split and mapped input string, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `q` is updated to the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `queries`, and `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `queries` remains as a list of integers formed by the split and mapped input string, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The values of `n` and `q` are updated to the respective input integers.
