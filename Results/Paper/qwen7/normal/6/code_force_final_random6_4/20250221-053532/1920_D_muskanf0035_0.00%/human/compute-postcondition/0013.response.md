The only object in the loop head is `_`, but since it's a dummy variable, it does not affect the loop condition. The loop condition depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` must be greater than 1 to start with, reducing it by 1 would still keep it greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of integers formed by the split and mapped input string, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
