The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of operations.
- `q` is an integer representing the number of queries.
- `operations` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x` indicating the type of operation (1 or 2) and the value `x`.
- `queries` is a list of integers `k_i` representing the positions of the elements Jayden wants to know.

Based on the operations and queries, the function processes the operations and returns the results for the specified queries. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list of operations, and a list of queries, and return the results for the specified queries after processing the given operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes the operations and returns the results for the specified queries.**
