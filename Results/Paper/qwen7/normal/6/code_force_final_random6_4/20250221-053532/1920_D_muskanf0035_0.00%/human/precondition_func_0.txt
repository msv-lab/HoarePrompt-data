n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries. op_type is either 1 or 2, where 1 indicates appending an integer to the end of the array, and 2 indicates appending x copies of the current array to the end. value is the integer to append when op_type is 1, and the number of copies to append when op_type is 2. The length of operations is equal to n, and the length of queries is equal to q.
