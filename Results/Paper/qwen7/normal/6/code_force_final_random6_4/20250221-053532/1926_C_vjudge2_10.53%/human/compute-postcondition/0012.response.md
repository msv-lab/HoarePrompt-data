Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must still be greater than 0. The variable `n` represents each of the input integers provided during the loop's execution. The `numbers` list will contain exactly `t` elements, with each element being one of the integers `n` that were input during the loop iterations.
