Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing `n` elements, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 1 and `numbers` being a list containing `n` elements remains unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user.
