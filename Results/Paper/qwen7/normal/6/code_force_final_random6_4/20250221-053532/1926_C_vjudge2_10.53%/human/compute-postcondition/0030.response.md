Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` will start with `i = 10` and continue until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 10, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is given as 11, which is correct for the loop to start.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 10 for the loop to execute properly.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 11, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `values[5]` is 5, `values[6]` is 6, `values[7]` is 7, `values[8]` is 8, `values[9]` is 9, `values[10]` is 10, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3]` is 4, `sum_values[5]` is 9, `sum_values[6]` is 15, `sum_values[7]` is 24, `sum_values[8]` is 35, `sum_values[9]` is 45, `sum_values[10]` is 55.**

Note: The values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are consistent with the given output state.
