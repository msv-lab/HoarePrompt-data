Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must still be greater than 0.

    #This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations (from `i=0` to `i=10`), the variable `total` will be the sum of numbers from 0 to 10, which is 45.

    #
    #**Explanation:**
    #- The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding value from the `sum_values` list.
    #- After each iteration, the `numbers` list loses one element because it is being consumed in the loop.
    #- Since the loop continues until there are no more elements in `numbers`, and we know that the loop executed 3 times, it means that `numbers` originally had at least 3 elements.
    #- However, since the loop consumes one element per iteration and we don't have any information that suggests `numbers` gets replenished, after 3 iterations, `numbers` will be empty.
    #- The values of `total`, `t`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
