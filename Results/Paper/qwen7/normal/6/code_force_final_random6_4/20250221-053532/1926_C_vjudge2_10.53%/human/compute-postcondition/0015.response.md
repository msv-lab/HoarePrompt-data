Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables or their values. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values` remain unchanged from the initial state.
