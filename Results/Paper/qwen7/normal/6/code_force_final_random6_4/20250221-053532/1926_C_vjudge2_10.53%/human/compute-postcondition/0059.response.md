Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be at least 10, `numbers` is an empty list, `values` is a list of length 14 with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length 14 with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 21.

**Explanation:**
- The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding value from the `sum_values` list.
- After each iteration, the `numbers` list loses one element because it is being consumed in the loop.
- Since the loop continues until there are no more elements in `numbers`, and we know that the loop executed 3 times, it means that `numbers` originally had at least 3 elements.
- However, since the loop consumes one element per iteration and we don't have any information that suggests `numbers` gets replenished, after 3 iterations, `numbers` will be empty.
- The values of `total`, `t`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
