Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_values` as a list of zeros with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `numbers`, or `values`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and only `sum_values` is newly initialized.
