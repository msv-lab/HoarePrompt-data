State: **`total` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head and starts from 0.
- The loop runs for 10 iterations, but we only need to ensure the initial state for the loop to start executing.
- All other variables (`total`, `t`, `n`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`) are already correctly described in their initial states as per the problem statement.
- Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 0 to start the loop execution.
