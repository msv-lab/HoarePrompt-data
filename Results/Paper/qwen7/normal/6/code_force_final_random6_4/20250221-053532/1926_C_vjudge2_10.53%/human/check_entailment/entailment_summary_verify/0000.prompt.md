You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of integers `t` and `n`. It first reads `t` test cases, each containing an integer `n`. For each test case, it initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, both of length equal to the maximum value in the input integers plus one, setting all elements to 0. It then populates the `values` list with the first 10 integers and calculates their cumulative sums in the `sum_values` list. Next, it updates the `values` and `sum_values` lists based on the last digit and the remaining part of each integer `n` in the input. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum corresponding to each integer `n` from the input. The function does not return any value but modifies the `values` and `sum_values` lists internally.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to `max(numbers)`, which is inefficient and incorrect for the given problem description.

The problem requires calculating the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to `n` individually for each test case. However, the provided program tries to precompute the results for all numbers up to the maximum value across all test cases, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
12
```
The correct output should be 51, but the program will not produce the correct result because it does not correctly handle the individual test cases.

To fix this, the program should iterate through each number from 1 to `n` for each test case and calculate the sum of its digits directly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            num = i
            digit_sum = 0
            while num > 0:
                digit_sum += num % 10
                num //= 10
            total_sum += digit_sum
        print(total_sum)

sum_of_digit_sums(int(input()))
```

This corrected version iterates through each number from 1 to `n` for each test case, calculates the sum of its digits, and accumulates the total sum, which correctly implements the problem description.
