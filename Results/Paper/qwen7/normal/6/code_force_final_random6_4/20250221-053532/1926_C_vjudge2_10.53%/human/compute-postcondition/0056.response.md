Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for n in numbers:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `numbers` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 45
   - `t` must be at least 10
   - `numbers` is a list of at least 10 elements
   - At least one element in `numbers` is 10 or greater

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the `numbers` list, we need to ensure that there are still elements left in the list.
   - We don't know the exact value of `n` from the previous iteration, but we know that the loop will continue as long as `numbers` has at least one element left.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `numbers` list. It must have at least one element left for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list of at least 9 elements (since at least one element was used in the previous iteration)**
