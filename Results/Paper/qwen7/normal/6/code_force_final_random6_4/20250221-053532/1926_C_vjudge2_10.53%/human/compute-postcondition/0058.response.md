Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be at least 10, `numbers` is an empty list, `values` is a list of length 14 with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length 14 with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 21.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. Since the initial state of `numbers` contains 10 elements, and the loop removes one element per iteration, after 10 iterations, the `numbers` list will be empty. The loop does not modify the `total`, `t`, `values`, `sum_values`, or `i` variables, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state after all iterations are completed.
