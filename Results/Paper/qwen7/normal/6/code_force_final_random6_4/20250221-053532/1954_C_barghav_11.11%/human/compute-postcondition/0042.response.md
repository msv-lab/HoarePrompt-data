Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `len(a)` must be at least `2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < len(a)`.
   - Given that `i` is now `2`, the condition will be `2 < len(a)`, which means `len(a)` must be at least `3`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `2`.
   - `len(a)` must be at least `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `2`, `len(a)` must be at least `3`**
