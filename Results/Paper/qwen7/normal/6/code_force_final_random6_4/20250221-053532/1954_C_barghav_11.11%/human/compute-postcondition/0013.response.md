Postcondition: `x` is a non-empty string, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from `x` with at least one character, `b` is a list of characters. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, then `b[i]` is equal to `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to half the length of `a`, then `b[i]` is equal to the maximum of `a[i]` and `n`.
