Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `len(a)` must be at least 3.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`, once `i` equals the length of `a`, the loop terminates. Given that the loop was able to execute at least 3 times, the length of `a` must be at least 3.
