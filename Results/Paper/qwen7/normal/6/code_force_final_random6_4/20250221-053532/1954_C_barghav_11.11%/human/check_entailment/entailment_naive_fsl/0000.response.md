Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. Specifically, the swapping logic in `func_1()` does not ensure that the largest digits are swapped between corresponding positions in `x` and `y` to maximize their product. Instead, it simply swaps the minimum and maximum digits within each position without considering the overall impact on the product.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
19
91
```
The program outputs:
```
91
19
```
However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits such that both numbers are as large as possible. In this case, swapping the digits results in `99` and `11`, which does not maximize the product. The correct approach would be to ensure that the highest digits are aligned in the most significant positions.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the digits of `x` and `y` in descending order and then pairing the largest digits from each number together. This ensures that the product is maximized.
