Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `b`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` is a list with at least 2 elements

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 2.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `b`. Given that `i` is now 2, `b` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to update the state to reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `b` is a list with at least 3 elements

State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list with at least 3 elements**
