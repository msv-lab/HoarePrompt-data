Output State: **`x` is a non-empty string, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from `x` with at least one character, `b` is a list of characters where `b[i_last + 1]` is either `n` if `i_last + 1` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, otherwise `b[i_last + 1]` is the maximum of `a[i_last + 1]` and `n`, `b[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a[i]` is now `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] = n` updates the value of `a[i]` to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
