Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `i` is 0, `b` is a list with at least one element.
2. The print statement is `print(b[i], end='')`.
3. Since `i` is 0, we need to access the first element of the list `b`.
4. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be no newline after the printed content, but this does not affect the content being printed.

Given that `b` is a list with at least one element, let's denote the first element of `b` as `b[0]`.

Output: **b[0]**
