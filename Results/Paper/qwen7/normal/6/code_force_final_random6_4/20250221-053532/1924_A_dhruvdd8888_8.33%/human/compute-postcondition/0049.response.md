Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with internal variables t (an integer between 1 and 10^5), n (an integer between 1 and 26), k (an integer between 1 and 26), m (an integer between 1 and 1000), and s (a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets). The function prints 'YES' if certain conditions are met based on these variables.**
