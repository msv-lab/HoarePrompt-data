Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `us` that contains characters starting from 'a' up to the k-th character in the alphabet. This is achieved using a generator expression within the set constructor. The set will contain the characters `'a', 'b', ..., chr(k + 96)` (since `chr(97)` is 'a'). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
