Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be the last character of the string `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be the last character processed. The variable `ps` will count how many times the condition `len(win) == k` was met, and each time it was met, the character `i` was added to the list `ans`. The set `win` is cleared after each successful addition to `ans`, so it will be empty at the end.
