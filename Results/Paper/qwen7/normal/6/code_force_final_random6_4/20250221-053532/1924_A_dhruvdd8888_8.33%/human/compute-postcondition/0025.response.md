Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`; `win` now contains `i` if `i` was in `us`, `ps` remains 0 if `i` was not in `us`, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing the element `i`.**

This means that the set `win` has been updated to include the value of `i` if `i` was already present in the set `us`. If `i` was not in `us`, the value of `ps` remains unchanged (which is 0). All other variables retain their initial states.
