Postcondition: **`i` is added to the set `win`; `ps` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n` is the integer value of the first input; `k` is the integer value of the second input; `m` is the integer value of the third input; `s` is the string entered by the user; `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet; `win` is a set containing the elements `i` and `k-1` because the length of `win` is now equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; and the first character of the string `s` is in the set `us`.**
