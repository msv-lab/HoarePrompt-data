Postcondition: **`i` is the last character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing all characters `i` from `s` that are in `us` and for which `len(win) == k` at some point during the loop, `win` is an empty set, and `ps` is the count of times `ans` was appended with a character, indicating how many times `win` reached size `k` during the loop. The current value of `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`**.
