You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \).
   - It then reads the string \( s \) of length \( m \).

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - `us` is initialized as a set containing the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is initialized as an empty set to keep track of characters seen so far.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list to store the sequence of characters forming a valid subsequence.
   - `ps` is initialized to 0 to count the number of valid subsequences found.

3. **Processing the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character in the string \( s \).
   - If the character is in `us`, it adds the character to `win`.
   - If `win` contains all \( k \) characters, it appends the character to `ans` and increments `ps`.
   - After appending, it clears `win`.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - After processing the entire string, it checks if `ps` (number of valid subsequences) is at least \( n \).
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to \( n \), it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length \( n \) using characters from `us` that were not part of the valid subsequence (`win`).

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. This should be corrected to call `func_1()` after reading the test case details.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The string construction logic in the `else` block is flawed. It constructs a string using characters from `us` that were not in `win`, but this does not necessarily guarantee that the constructed string is a valid subsequence of \( s \). Instead, it should construct a string that cannot be a subsequence of \( s \).

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The output formatting should ensure that the string printed in the `else` block is indeed a valid counterexample.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Construct a string of length n that cannot be a subsequence of s
        missing_chars = [c for c in us if c not in win]
        if not missing_chars:
            # If no missing characters, use the last character of s
            missing_chars = [s[-1]]
        # Construct a string using the first n characters from missing_chars
        result = ''.join(missing_chars[:n])
        print(result)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues with the function call and the string construction logic. The corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the test cases and outputs the required results.
