Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `us`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the last character of the string `s`.
   - `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the set `us`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is the last character of the string `s`, it cannot be directly used as the loop variable because the loop is iterating over `us`, not `s`.
   - `us` is the set of characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, so the loop will iterate over each character in this set.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `us` to reflect the set of characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.

**State:**
- `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet**
