Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - `i` is the current character being processed in the loop.
   - `s` is the string that the loop is iterating over.

4. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the first character of the string `s`.
   - `win` contains `i` if `i` is in the set `us`.
   - `ps` is 1 if `len(win) == k`, otherwise `ps` remains 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first input.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second input.
   - `m` is the integer value of the third input.
   - `s` is the string entered by the user.
   - `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.
   - `ans` contains the element `i`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After processing the first character `i` of the string `s`, the next character in the string will be the new value of `i`.
   - The string `s` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is the second character of the string `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `ans`, `win`, `ps`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the second character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` contains the element `i`, `win` contains `i` if `i` is in the set `us`, `ps` is 1 if `len(win) == k`, otherwise `ps` remains 0**.
