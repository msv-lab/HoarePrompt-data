Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as inputs.
   - It checks if `extroverts % 3 == 0`. If not, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`.
   - If the above condition is met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
   - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as inputs.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and stores the result in `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

3. **Problem Description and Test Cases**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed for `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` such that all participants' preferences are respected.
   - The solution logic seems to correctly handle the constraints:
     - Each introvert needs a separate tent.
     - Extroverts prefer to share a tent with two others, and if they can't, they might need additional universals to fill the tent.
     - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where `extroverts` cannot form complete groups of three without additional universals, `func_1` returns `None`, which is correctly handled by `func_2` to return `-1`.
   - Other cases where `extroverts` can form complete groups of three are correctly handled by returning the appropriate number of tents.

5. **Test Case Verification**:
   - All provided test cases are correctly handled by the program. The outputs match the expected results.

Given the analysis and the test cases, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
