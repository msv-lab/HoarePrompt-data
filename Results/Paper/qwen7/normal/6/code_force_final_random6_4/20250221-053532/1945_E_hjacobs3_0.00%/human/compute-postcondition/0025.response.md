Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.**

This means the program returns a list with the first element being "1" and the second element being the index of `find` in the array plus one.
