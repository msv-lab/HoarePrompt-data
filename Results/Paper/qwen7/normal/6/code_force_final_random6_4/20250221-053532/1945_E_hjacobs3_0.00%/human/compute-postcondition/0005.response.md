Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2, and the value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is updated to `mid - 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still (0 + (n - 1)) // 2, and the condition that `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find` is preserved.
