Output State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `r` will eventually become less than `l` because the loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Once `r` becomes less than `l`, the condition `l <= r` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `r` will be one less than `l`, i.e., `r` will be -1, and `l` will be the next integer greater than `r`, which is 0. Therefore, the final state of the variables is `array` remains unchanged, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
