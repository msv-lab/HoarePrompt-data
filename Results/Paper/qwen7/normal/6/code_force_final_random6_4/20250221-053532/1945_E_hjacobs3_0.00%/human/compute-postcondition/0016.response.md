Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `(mid - 1)` if `array[mid] >= find`, otherwise `l` is `(mid + 1)`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2**.

This means that the variable `mid` has been updated to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r`. The values of `array`, `l`, `r`, and `find` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `mid` now holds the new value calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. The condition for `mid` being `(mid - 1)` or `(mid + 1)` remains the same based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find`.
