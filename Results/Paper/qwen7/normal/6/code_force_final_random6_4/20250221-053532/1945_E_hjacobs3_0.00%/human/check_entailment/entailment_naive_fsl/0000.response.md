Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where the element to be found (`x`) is not present in the array. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation so that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the middle element (`array[mid]`) is greater than or equal to `find`, which does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` and we need to find `3`. The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. `l = 0`, `r = 5`, `mid = 2` (since `(0 + 5) // 2 = 2`). `array[mid] = 1`, which is less than `3`, so `l = mid + 1 = 3`.
2. `l = 3`, `r = 5`, `mid = 4` (since `(3 + 5) // 2 = 4`). `array[mid] = 2`, which is less than `3`, so `l = mid + 1 = 5`.
3. `l = 5`, `r = 5`, `r - l = 0`, so the loop ends.

Since `l` is now `5` and `r` is `5`, the loop ends without finding `3`. The function returns `0`, indicating no operations were needed, but in reality, we need to swap elements to place `3` at the correct position.

To fix this, the function should check if `x` is present in the array and, if not, find the closest elements to swap to make `3` (or the target value) appear at the correct position. This requires additional logic to handle the case where `x` is not in the array.
