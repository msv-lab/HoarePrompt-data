You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `r` will eventually become less than `l` because the loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Once `r` becomes less than `l`, the condition `l <= r` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `r` will be one less than `l`, i.e., `r` will be -1, and `l` will be the next integer greater than `r`, which is 0. Therefore, the final state of the variables is `array` remains unchanged, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
