#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `r` will eventually become less than `l` because the loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Once `r` becomes less than `l`, the condition `l <= r` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `r` will be one less than `l`, i.e., `r` will be -1, and `l` will be the next integer greater than `r`, which is 0. Therefore, the final state of the variables is `array` remains unchanged, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found, it prints "1" and returns a list containing "1" and the index where `find` should be inserted to maintain the permutation order. If `find` is found, it prints "0" and returns a list containing "1" and the index of `find` in the array, both incremented by 1. The original `array` remains unchanged, and the final values of `l` and `r` are 0 and -1, respectively.
