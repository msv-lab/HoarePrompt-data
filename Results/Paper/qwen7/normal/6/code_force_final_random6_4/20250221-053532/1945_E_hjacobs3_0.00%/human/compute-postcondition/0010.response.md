Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**.

The value of `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which simplifies to `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2` or `(n - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
