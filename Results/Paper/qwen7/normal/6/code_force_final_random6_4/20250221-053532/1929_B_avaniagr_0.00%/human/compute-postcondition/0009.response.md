Output State: The loop will continue to execute for as many lines of input as provided, with each iteration processing a new line of input. For each line, `n` and `k` will be updated to the integer values of the first and second parts of the input split by spaces, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `n` and `k` will be those from the last line of input processed.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the output state will reflect the `n` and `k` values from the last line of input provided to the program.
