You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple lines of input, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It calculates and prints a value based on these inputs according to specific conditions. After processing all input lines, the function does not return any value but outputs the calculated results for each line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), we can color all cells in the grid, ensuring every diagonal has at least one colored cell. This would require \( 2n \) cells.
   - If \( k < 4n - 3 \), we need to find a way to color fewer cells while still meeting the requirement.

3. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a conditional expression to determine the number of cells to color:
     ```python
     (k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
     ```

4. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part handles the case when \( k < 4n - 3 \). Here, `k // 2 + k % 2` calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals. For example, if \( k = 4 \), it will calculate \( 2 \) (since \( 4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 \)).
   - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part handles the case when \( k \geq 4n - 3 \). It ensures that all \( 2n \) cells are colored.
   - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part is redundant because it doesn't change the result due to the previous conditions.

5. **Verification:**
   - For \( k = 4 \):
     - \( 4 // 2 + 4 % 2 = 2 \)
     - Since \( 4 < 4n - 3 \), the expression evaluates to \( 2 \).
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \):
     - \( 4n - 2 \geq 4n - 3 \), so it evaluates to \( 2n \).

Given these observations, the solution correctly handles both scenarios and provides the minimum number of cells to color.

The given solution is correct.
