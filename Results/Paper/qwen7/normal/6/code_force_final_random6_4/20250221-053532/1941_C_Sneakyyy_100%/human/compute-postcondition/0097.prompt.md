Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans` is between 0 and the length of `a` divided by 3, inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a`. The variable `ans` will be incremented each time a substring 'map' or 'pie' is found in the string `a`. Since the loop checks every 3 characters, the maximum value of `ans` would be the length of `a` divided by 3. If no 'map' or 'pie' substrings are found, `ans` remains 0. The variable `s` will be the last 3-character substring checked, which could be 'map' or 'pie' if it was found, or the last possible 3-character substring of `a` if it wasn't.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is the final index value where the loop terminated, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be set to the index right after the last occurrence of 'map' or 'pie' plus two, or it will be equal to the length of `a` if no such substrings were found. The variable `s` will be the last valid substring of length 3 that was checked, which could be 'map', 'pie', or an empty string if no valid substrings were found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`, `a` is the original string input by the user, `i` is the final index value where the loop terminates (which is `len(a)`), and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which could be 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appeared in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all possible iterations without finding any more occurrences of 'map' or 'pie'. The variable `s` will be the last 3-character substring checked, which could be 'map', 'pie', or it might not exist if the string `a` is too short or doesn't contain 'map' or 'pie'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
