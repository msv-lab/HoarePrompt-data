Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string "pie" or "map" appears multiple times with overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "ppieemap", the program would only remove two characters ('e' and 'm') but should remove three characters ('pie') to make the string beautiful. The current implementation increments `ans` and moves the index `i` by 3 whenever it finds "pie" or "map", which skips over potential shorter removals for overlapping substrings.
