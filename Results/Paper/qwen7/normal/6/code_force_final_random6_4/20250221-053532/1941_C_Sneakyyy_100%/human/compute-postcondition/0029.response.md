Output State: `ans` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, and `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `a`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. For each iteration, it checks the substring `a[i:i+3]`. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is incremented by 3 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. The loop terminates when `i` reaches or exceeds the length of `a` minus 2. Therefore, after all iterations, `ans` will hold the total count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in `a`, and `i` will be set to a value that is at least the length of `a`.
