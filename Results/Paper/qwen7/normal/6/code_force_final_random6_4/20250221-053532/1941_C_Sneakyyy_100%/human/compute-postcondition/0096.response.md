Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
- `a` is the original string input by the user.
- `i` is the final index value where the loop terminates, which is `len(a)`.
- `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which could be 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which represents the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `ans` will hold the count of how many times 'map' or 'pie' appears in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
