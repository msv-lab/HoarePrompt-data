Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and taking the next 3 characters. The values of `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 0, and the new variable `s` is created with the first 3 characters of `a`.
