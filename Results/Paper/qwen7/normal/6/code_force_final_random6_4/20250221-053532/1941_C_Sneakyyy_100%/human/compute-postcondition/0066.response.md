Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is the final index value where the loop terminated, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.** 

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
