Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 1 (or 0)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a string input by the user
   - `i` is 4 (or 2)
   - `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' (or neither 'map' nor 'pie')

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `a`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - If `ans` is 1, then `i` is 4.
   - If `ans` is 0, then `i` is 2.
   - In both cases, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 1 or 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` must be 4 or 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 6, and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.
