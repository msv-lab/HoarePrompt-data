Output State: **Postcondition: `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`; `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i]]`; the current value of `k` is less than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables `fav`, `l`, `i`, `k`, or `dic` within the statement itself, the only change is that the loop or conditional block is exited. The postcondition remains the same, indicating that `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i]]`, and the current value of `k` is less than 0.
