Output State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the only changes are that we know the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `fav`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.
