Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`, `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of list `o`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the string at index `f - 1` of list `o` to the variable `fav`. Since `f` is the second element of list `b`, `f - 1` corresponds to the first element of list `o`. The other variables remain unchanged.
