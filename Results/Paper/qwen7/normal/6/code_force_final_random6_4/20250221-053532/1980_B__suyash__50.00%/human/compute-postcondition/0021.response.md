Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `o` is a list of strings sorted in descending order, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `k` is the third element of the list `b`, `fav` is the `(f - 1)`-th element of the list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`, and if the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one).
