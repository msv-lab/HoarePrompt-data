Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means that `i` is incremented by 1 from whatever its previous value was.
- `k` is `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`: This means that `k` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `dic[l[i]]` from its previous value. Here, `l[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `l`.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables or objects. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
