Postcondition: `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`, `fav` is an integer, `i` is an index, `l` is a list of integers. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i]]`. If the current value of `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
