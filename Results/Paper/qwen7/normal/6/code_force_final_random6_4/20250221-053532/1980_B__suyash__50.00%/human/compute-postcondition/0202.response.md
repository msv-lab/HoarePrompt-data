Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is adjusted by subtracting `2 * dic[l[i]]` from its original value. If `k` becomes less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` does not become less than or equal to 0, no further changes are made to `i` and `k`.
