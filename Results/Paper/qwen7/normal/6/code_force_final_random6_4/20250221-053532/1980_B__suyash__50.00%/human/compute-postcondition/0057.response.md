Postcondition: `fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, and `k` is decreased by either the value at index `i_end + 1` of list `l` or by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]` if `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`. In both cases (whether `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]` or `fav` equals `l[i_end + 1]`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
