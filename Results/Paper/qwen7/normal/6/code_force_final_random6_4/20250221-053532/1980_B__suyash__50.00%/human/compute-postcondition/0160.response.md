Postcondition: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings sorted in reverse order, `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`, `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`. If the index of `fav` in list `o` is greater than `k - 1`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
