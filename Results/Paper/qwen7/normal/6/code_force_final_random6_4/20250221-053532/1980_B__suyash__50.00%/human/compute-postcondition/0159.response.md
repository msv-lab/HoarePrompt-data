The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings sorted in reverse order, `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`, `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`.**
