Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is less than or equal to 0, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `left[i] - a[i] - 1` to `x`. Given that `i` is 2, `x` is calculated as `left[2] - a[2] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
