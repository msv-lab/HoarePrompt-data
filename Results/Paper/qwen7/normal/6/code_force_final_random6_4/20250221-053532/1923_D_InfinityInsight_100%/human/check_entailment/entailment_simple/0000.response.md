Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the smallest index in the list `a` where the element is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It correctly handles the edge cases where `x` is not found in the list `a`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `left` is initialized to store cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
     - `last` is initialized to store the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in `a`.
     - `ans` is initialized to store the result for each slime.
   - **Populating `last`**:
     - For each unique element in `a`, `last` stores the index of its first occurrence.
   - **Populating `left`**:
     - `left` is populated with cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
   - **Calculating `ans`**:
     - For each slime, it checks if the current slime can eat its left neighbor.
     - If it can, it calculates the time it takes for the current slime to eat the left neighbor.
     - It also checks if the current slime can be eaten by its right neighbor by using `func_1` on the cumulative sums stored in `left`.
     - The minimum time for the current slime to be eaten is calculated and stored in `ans`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice (once for the original list and once for the reversed list).
   - It then compares the results of these two calls to determine the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the time for each slime to be eaten, considering both left and right neighbors.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
