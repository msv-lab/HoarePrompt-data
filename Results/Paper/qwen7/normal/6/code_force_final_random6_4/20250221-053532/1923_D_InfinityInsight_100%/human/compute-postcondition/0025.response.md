Output State: **`last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `left` is a list with its last element increased by the second element of the list `a` plus the last element of `left`.**

Explanation: The code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends to the list `left` the value of its last element (`left[-1]`) plus the value of `i` (which is the second element of the list `a`). This means the last element of `left` is updated to be the sum of its previous last element and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
