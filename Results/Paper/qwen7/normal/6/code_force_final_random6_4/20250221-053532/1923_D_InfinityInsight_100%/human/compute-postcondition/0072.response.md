Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` remains unchanged, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `ans[4]` is 2 - `inx`.**

Explanation: The code `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Since `i` is 4, `i - 1` is 3, so `inx2` is now `last[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
