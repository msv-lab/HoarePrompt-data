Output State: **`left` is [0], `a` is a list of n integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `last` is [-1], `ans` is a list of length n with all elements set to -1**.

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of length `n` (where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`) with all elements set to -1. The values of `left` and `last` remain unchanged from their initial states.
