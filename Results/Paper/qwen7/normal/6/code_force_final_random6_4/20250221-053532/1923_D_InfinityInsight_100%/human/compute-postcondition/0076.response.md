Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` remains unchanged, `inx` is either `inx2` or `inx`, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `ans[4]` is 2 - `inx`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `inx`, `x`, and `ans[4]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
