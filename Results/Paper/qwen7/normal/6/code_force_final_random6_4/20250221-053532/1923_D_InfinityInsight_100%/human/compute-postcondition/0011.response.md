Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`

2. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.
     - If true, `i` is appended to the list `last`.
     - If false, the last element of `last` is appended with itself.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `2` if the loop continues.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
