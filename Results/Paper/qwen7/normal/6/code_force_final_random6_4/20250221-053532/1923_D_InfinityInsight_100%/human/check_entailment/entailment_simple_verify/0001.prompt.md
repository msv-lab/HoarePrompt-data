You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

    #
    #In more detail, the list `last` remains unchanged as it only records the first occurrences of unique elements and does not get updated inside the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in the list `a` after the loop completes.

The list `ans` is updated such that for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is calculated based on the logic within the loop. Specifically, `ans[i]` is set to `2 - inx` if `inx` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is set to `i + 1 - inx`. The variable `inx` is determined by comparing `inx2` (which is `last[i - 1]`) and `inx` (calculated using `func_1(left, x)`), and `inx` is adjusted to be 0 if it is negative. The list `left` is updated such that its last element is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) is calculated as follows: if `inx` (determined by the logic inside the loop) is less than or equal to 0, then `ans[i] = 2 - inx`; otherwise, `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx`. The last element of the list `left` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns `inx + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes `left` and `last` lists.
   - `left` stores cumulative sums of the array `a`.
   - `last` stores the index of the last occurrence of each element in `a` (to handle duplicate elements).
   - Iterates through the array `a` to populate `ans` with the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
     - If the current slime is smaller than the previous one, it immediately gets eaten, so `ans[i] = 1`.
     - Otherwise, calculates the position `inx` where the current slime's size minus one would fit in the cumulative sum `left`.
     - Adjusts `inx` using the `last` list to account for duplicate elements.
     - If `inx` is valid, calculates the time taken for the slime to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by a larger neighboring slime. If no such sequence exists, the answer should be `-1`.

### Correctness Check
1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` and `last` are initialized correctly to handle cumulative sums and duplicates.
   
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - `left` is updated correctly to store cumulative sums, which helps in determining the position where a slime can be eaten.

3. **Duplicate Handling**:
   - `last` is used to handle duplicate elements, ensuring that the position of the last occurrence is considered when calculating the position `inx`.

4. **Eating Condition**:
   - The condition `if a[i] < a[i - 1]:` correctly identifies slimes that are immediately eaten.
   - The calculation of `inx` and `inx2` ensures that the position where the slime can be eaten is correctly determined.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `ans` list is populated correctly with the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct and align with the problem requirements.
