### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position of the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `x` is not present in `a` by returning the index of the next largest element.
   - The function logic is correct and adheres to the problem requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of cumulative sums and first occurrences of unique elements, respectively.
   - The logic to update the `left` list by summing up the elements of `a` is correct.
   - The main loop iterates through the elements of `a` and calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
     - It correctly identifies if a slime can eat its left neighbor and updates the answer accordingly.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the position of the smallest element in `left` that is greater than or equal to `x - a[i] - 1`.
     - The logic to handle the case where the slime cannot eat any neighbor is correct.
   - The final return statement returns the list `ans` which contains the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice (once forward and once backward) and then taking the minimum of the two results for each slime.
   - This approach ensures that the program considers both directions of eating, which is necessary to cover all possible scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. All functions work as intended, and the main program correctly processes each test case and outputs the expected results.

### Correctness:
**True**
