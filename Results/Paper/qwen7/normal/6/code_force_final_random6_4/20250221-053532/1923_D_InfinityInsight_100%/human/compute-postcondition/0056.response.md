Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`**.

The code assigns the return value of `func_1(left, x)` to `inx`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `inx`. However, we know that `inx` now holds whatever `func_1(left, x)` returns. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
