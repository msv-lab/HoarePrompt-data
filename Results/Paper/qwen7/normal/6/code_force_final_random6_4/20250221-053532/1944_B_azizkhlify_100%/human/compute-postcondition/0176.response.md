Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `a`. Since `a` is not defined or initialized with any specific values, we cannot determine what `a[i]` will be. Therefore, we can only describe the structure of the output based on the given information.

Given that `i` is 2, the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[2] a[2]**
