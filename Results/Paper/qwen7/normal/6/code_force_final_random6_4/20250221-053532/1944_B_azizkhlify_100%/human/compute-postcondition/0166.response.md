The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
