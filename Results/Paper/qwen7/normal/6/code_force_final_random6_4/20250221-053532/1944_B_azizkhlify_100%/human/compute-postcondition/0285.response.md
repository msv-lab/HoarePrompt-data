Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `l` is a list.
   - `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `2 * n`. Given that `i` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `n + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 again in the next iteration, but this does not affect the state of `i` or `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
