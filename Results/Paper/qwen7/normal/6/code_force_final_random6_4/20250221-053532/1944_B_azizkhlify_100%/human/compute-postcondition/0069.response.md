Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `2 * n`
   - `re` is incremented by 1 to equal `k`
   - `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`
   - `k` is non-zero

3. **Determine how the loop affects these variables**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * n`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is always greater than `n` (assuming `n` is a positive integer), the loop cannot execute again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, no changes are needed for `i` or `n`.
   - The other variables (`re`, `ul`, and `k`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen in this case) would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `re` is incremented by 1 to equal `k`, `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`, and `k` is non-zero.**
