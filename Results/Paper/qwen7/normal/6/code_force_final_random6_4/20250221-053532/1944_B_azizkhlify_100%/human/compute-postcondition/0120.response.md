Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1 until it reaches `2 * n`.
3. **Determine the state changes inside the loop**:
   - `ur` is increased by either 4 or remains unchanged based on the value of `r[a[i] - 1]`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
4. **Check the loop termination condition**: The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ur` is increased by either 4 (if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`) or remains unchanged (if `r[a[i] - 1] != 2`).
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is some value between `n` and `2 * n - 1` (inclusive).
- `n` is a constant.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `i` should be within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `x` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
- `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` will be updated according to the loop body, but their exact values depend on the loop body and cannot be determined without it.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers**.
