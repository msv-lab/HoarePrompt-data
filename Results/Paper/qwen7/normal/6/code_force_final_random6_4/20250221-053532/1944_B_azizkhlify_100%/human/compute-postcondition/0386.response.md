Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the condition holds true; `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged and does not affect `ur`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it means that the loop or conditional block is exited, but no changes are made to the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, or `r[a[i] - 1]`. Therefore, the conditions and values remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
