Output State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` updates the element in list `l` at index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Given that `i` is `2 * n - 1`, the value of `i` does not change. Also, `n` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged. The only change is that the element in list `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is set to 0.
