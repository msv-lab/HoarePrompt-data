Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `re` is `re + 1`, `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`, `k` is non-zero, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, `res` contains `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. The other variables (`i`, `re`, `ul`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is still `1` as per the precondition.
