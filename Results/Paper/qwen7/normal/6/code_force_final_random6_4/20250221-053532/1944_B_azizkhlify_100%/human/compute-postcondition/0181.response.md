Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `l[a[2] - 1]` is 0. If `l[a[2] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this scenario, it simply exits the loop or case without changing any variable values. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `l[a[2] - 1]`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their initial states.
