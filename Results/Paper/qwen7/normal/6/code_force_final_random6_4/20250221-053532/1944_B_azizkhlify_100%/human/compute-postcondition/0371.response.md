Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Given the initial conditions, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. After executing the code, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` changes to 0, while the other conditions remain unchanged.
