Output State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 0**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` from 2 to 0. Since `i` is `2 * n - 1` and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains `2 * n - 1` and `n` must still be greater than 0. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is updated to 0.
