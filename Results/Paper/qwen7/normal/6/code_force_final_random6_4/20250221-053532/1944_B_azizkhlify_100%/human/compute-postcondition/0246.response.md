Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is the sixth element from `res`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`.
   - `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`.
   - `ur` is 2 more than its original value if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 and `ul` equals `ur`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Given the initial state, the print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, we need to express it in terms of the given conditions.

From the conditions:
- `i` is the sixth element from `res`, so `a[i]` is the sixth element of the list `a`.
- `n` is constrained by two conditions: `n <= res[4]` and `2 * n > res[4]`. This means `n` is an integer such that it satisfies both these inequalities.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not dependent on `n` but rather on the position `i` in the list `a`. Therefore, `a[i]` is simply the sixth element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[6] a[6]**
