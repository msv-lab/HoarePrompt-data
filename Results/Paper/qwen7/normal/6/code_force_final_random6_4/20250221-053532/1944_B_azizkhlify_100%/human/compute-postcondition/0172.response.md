Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `n` or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The postcondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1 remains unchanged.
