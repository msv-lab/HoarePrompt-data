Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the condition holds true.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `n` to `2 * n` (exclusive).

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is now `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `n + 1 < 2 * n`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The variable `i` needs to be updated to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition `n < 2 * n` still holds true since `i` is incremented by 1, and the inequality `n + 1 < 2 * n` is satisfied as long as `n` is positive.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must still be less than `2 * n`.
   - The condition `ul == ur` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the condition holds true**
