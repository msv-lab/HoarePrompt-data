Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `a[0]`
- `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`

When the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Since `i` is `a[0]`, and `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, it implies that `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0]**
