Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2.** 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `ul == ur` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as described: `i` will be incremented by 1, `n` will remain unchanged, `x` will still be an integer, `a` will be a list of integers, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be 0, and `ur` will be increased by 2.
