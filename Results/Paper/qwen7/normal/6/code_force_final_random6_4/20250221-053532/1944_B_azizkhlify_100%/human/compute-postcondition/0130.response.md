Postcondition: **`i` is `a[0]`, `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, and `ur` is the total count of elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` and were set to 0. No further changes to `ur` occur once it equals `ul`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block executes:
- The variable `i` retains the value `a[0]` because the loop body does not change the value of `i`.
- The list `res` remains unchanged, still containing `[a[0], a[0]]`, since the loop body does not modify the contents of `res`.
- The variable `ur` is the total count of elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` and were set to 0. Once `ur` equals `ul`, no further changes to `ur` occur.
