You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has processed all test cases provided as input. At the end of all iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, indicating that the loop has gone through all elements in the array `r`. The variable `res` contains all the elements that were printed during the loop's execution, which are pairs of identical numbers from the array `a` that appeared exactly twice, along with individual numbers from the second half of the array `a` that appeared exactly once up to the required count `k`. The variable `ur` is the total count of elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` and were set to 0, reflecting the count of elements in the second half of `a` that were printed. The loop ensures that all possible pairs and single occurrences are printed according to the rules specified, and `ur` reflects the final count of such elements from the second half of the array `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It derives values `n` and `k` from the array length and range respectively. The function prints pairs of identical numbers from the first half of the array `a` that appear exactly twice, followed by individual numbers from the second half of the array `a` that appear exactly once up to the required count `k`. After processing all test cases, it prints the elements stored in the list `res`, which contain the pairs and single occurrences printed during the execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find two arrays \( l \) and \( r \), each of length \( 2k \), such that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) equals the bitwise XOR of elements in \( r \). The arrays \( l \) and \( r \) should be subsets of the first half and the second half of the given array \( a \), respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It initializes arrays `l` and `r` to store the elements of the subsets.
   - It counts occurrences of each element in the first half and second half of the array `a`.
   - It tries to fill the subset `l` with pairs of elements that occur exactly twice in the first half.
   - If it cannot fill `l` completely, it fills the remaining positions with single occurrences from the first half.
   - It prints the elements of `l` and then prints the same elements again (since `r` is supposed to be the same as `l`).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for filling `l` is flawed. It only considers elements that occur exactly twice in the first half, which might not cover all required elements.
   - The code does not ensure that the XOR condition is met. It simply prints the same elements for both `l` and `r`, which does not guarantee the XOR condition will be satisfied.
   - The code does not handle the case where the XOR condition cannot be met with the current approach.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the XOR condition is met and it does not properly construct the subsets `l` and `r`.

Correctness: **False**
