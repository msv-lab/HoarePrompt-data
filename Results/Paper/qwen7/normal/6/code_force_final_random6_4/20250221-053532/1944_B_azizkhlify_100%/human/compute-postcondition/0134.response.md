Output State: **`i` is `a[0]`, `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `ur` is the total count of elements in `r` that correspond to indices `a[i] - 1` where `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1` and were set to 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `i`, `res`, `n`, `k`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `a` is created and its contents depend on the user's input.
