Postcondition: `i` is the sixth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `ul` equals `ur`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
