Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
