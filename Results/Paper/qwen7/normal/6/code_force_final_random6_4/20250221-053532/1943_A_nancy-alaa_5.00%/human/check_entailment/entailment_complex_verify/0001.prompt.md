You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until it processes all test cases. After all iterations, `first` will either be True or False depending on whether a unique element (with a count of 1) was found after the first unique element. The value of `i` will be -1 because the loop breaks when it finds the required condition. `n` will be the last input integer processed, `arr` will be the last list of integers based on the final input, and `mpp` will be the `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`. If no elements with a count of 1 were found after the first unique element, `first` will remain False; otherwise, it will be True.
    #
    #The loop will terminate once all test cases are processed, and the conditions specified in the loop body are no longer met for any remaining elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest missing integer or the smallest integer with a count of 1 after the first unique element. If no such element is found, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Preparation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `arr`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `0` to `n-1` to determine the MEX.
   - If a number `i` is not present in the array (`i not in mpp.keys()`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If the number `i` appears exactly once and `first` is already `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If the number `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Misunderstanding of Player Moves**:
   - The program incorrectly simulates the game logic. According to the problem, Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, and then delete it from `a`. Bob can only pick and delete an element from `a`.
   - The current implementation does not simulate these moves correctly. It just checks for the presence of elements in the array and prints the first missing number, which does not reflect the actual game dynamics.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The current approach does not consider the sequence of moves and the impact of each player's actions on the final state of `c`.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of the program is not consistent with the expected behavior of the game. It simply prints the first missing number without considering the optimal play of both players.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
