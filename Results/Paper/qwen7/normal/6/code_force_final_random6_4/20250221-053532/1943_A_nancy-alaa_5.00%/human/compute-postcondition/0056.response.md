Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `i` is either not in the keys of `mpp` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or `i` is in the keys of `mpp`.
