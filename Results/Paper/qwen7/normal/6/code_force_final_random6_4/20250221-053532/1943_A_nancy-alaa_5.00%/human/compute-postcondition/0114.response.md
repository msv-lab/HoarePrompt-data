Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` remains `False`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.

4. **Condition for Breaking the Loop**: The loop will break if the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is `True`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `first` remains `False` and no change occurs if the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is not met, `first` will still be `False`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

6. **New State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `first` remains `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

To summarize the final state in the required format:

State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.
