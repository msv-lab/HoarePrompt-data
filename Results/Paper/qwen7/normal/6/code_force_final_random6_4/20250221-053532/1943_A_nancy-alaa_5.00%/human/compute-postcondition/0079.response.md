The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

According to the given information:
- The loop condition is based on `i` and `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `first` remains `False`, `i` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `mpp[i]` equals 1.
- If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1, no change occurs to the variables.

Since `i` is decremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. Also, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because it is not modified within the loop head.

Given this, let's adjust the states:

State: **`first` remains False, `i` is decremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `mpp[i]` does not equal 1**. 

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`first` is False, `i` is `i - 1`, `n` is the same as before, and `mpp[i]` does not equal 1**.
