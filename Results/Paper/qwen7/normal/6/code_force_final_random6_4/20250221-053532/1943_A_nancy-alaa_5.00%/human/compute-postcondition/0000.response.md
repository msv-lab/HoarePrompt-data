Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically represents the index of the current iteration. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't hold any meaningful value that affects the loop's execution, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine what affects the loop's execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer. Since the problem guarantees that the input will be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\), the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Consider the state before the loop**: The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\). This means that `t` is already set to a valid value that ensures the loop will execute.

Given these points, there are no specific adjustments needed for the loop to execute because the loop will always run based on the provided constraints.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)**

This state is sufficient to ensure that the loop will execute as expected.
