Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `n` must be greater than `0`

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly defined as `1`. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
