Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`, which means it was likely set to `False` previously.
- `i` is less than `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each element in `arr`.
- The current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `i`.

Since `i` is a valid index in the list `arr` and it is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1, we know that `i` is a valid index for the list and there is exactly one occurrence of the element at index `i` in the list.

Output: **i (where i is a valid index in the list arr and the count of the element at index i in mpp is 1)**
