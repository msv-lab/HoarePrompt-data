Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required. Instead, it tries to find the smallest integer that is not present in the array `arr`, which does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
0
0
```

This happens because the program simply checks for the smallest integer not present in the array `arr` without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob. In the first test case, after Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, and then Alice picks 0, resulting in `c = [1, 0]`. The MEX of `[1, 0]` is 2, which matches the expected output. However, the program incorrectly outputs 0 because it does not simulate the game turns.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to handle the optimal strategy of both players, making it incorrect.
