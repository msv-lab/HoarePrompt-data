Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `ii`.
   - The loop runs for `n - 1` iterations.
   - Therefore, the loop head involves the variables `ii` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions:**
   - After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `cn` will be 1 if every consecutive pair of elements in `num` is the same, otherwise it will be less than `n-1`.
   - Other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations.

3. **Determine Initial Values for Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop runs `n - 1` times, `ii` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n - 1` iterations imply `n > 1`).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 so that the loop can run `n - 1` times.
   - The value of `ii` at the start of the loop should be 0.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 2.
- `ii` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ii` is 0**
