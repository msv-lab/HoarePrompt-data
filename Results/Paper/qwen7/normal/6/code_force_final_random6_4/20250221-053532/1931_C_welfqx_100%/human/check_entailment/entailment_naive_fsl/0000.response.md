Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle arrays with multiple distinct values that require different operations to make all elements equal.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6
1 2 3 3 2 1
```

- Expected Output:
```
4
15
2
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
4
0
2
```

The program incorrectly handles the second and third cases. For the second case, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the minimum cost should be 15, as we need to change all elements to either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The program only considers the longest consecutive sequence of the same element, which is not sufficient for arrays with multiple distinct values.

For the third case, the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]`, the program outputs 2, but the correct answer should be 4, as we can change the array to all 3's with a cost of 4.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
