Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `cn` will be 1 if every consecutive pair of elements in `num` is the same, otherwise it will be less than `n-1`. The other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of the list `num` (excluding the last element). The variable `cn` will reflect whether all consecutive pairs of elements in `num` are identical; if they are, `cn` will be incremented each time such a pair is found, up to a maximum of `n-1` if all pairs match. If any pair does not match, the loop will break early, and `cn` will be set to the count of matching pairs encountered before the mismatch. The other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will keep their values from either the initial state or as described after the first three iterations of the loop.
