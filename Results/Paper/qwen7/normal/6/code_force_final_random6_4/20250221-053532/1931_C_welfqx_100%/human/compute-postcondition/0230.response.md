Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t indicating the number of cases, an integer n representing the size of an array a, and the array a itself. For each test case, the function checks if the array contains any non-consecutive elements. If all elements are consecutive, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive identical elements in both the original and reversed arrays and prints the difference between the array size n and this maximum length.**
