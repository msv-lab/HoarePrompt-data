Output State: **`cn` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, and the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the value of `num[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cn` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`n`, `j`, `num[i]`, and `num[i + 1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
