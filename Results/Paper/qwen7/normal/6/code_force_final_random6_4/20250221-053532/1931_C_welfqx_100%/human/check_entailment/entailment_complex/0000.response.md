Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation. The cost of an operation is the length of the subarray being modified.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The program checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `0` since no operation is needed.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive identical elements in both the original array and its reverse.
   - The logic to find these lengths is correct:
     - `cn` finds the length of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the array.
     - `ck` finds the length of consecutive identical elements starting from the end of the array (by reversing the array).
   - If the first elements of the original and reversed arrays are the same, `cn` is incremented by `ck` to account for the possibility of a longer segment of identical elements spanning both ends.
   - Finally, it prints `n - max(cn, ck)` which gives the minimum cost to make the array uniform.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already uniform by printing `0`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the entire array is the same by setting `cn` and `ck` to `n`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum length of consecutive identical elements is sound.
   - The calculation of the minimum cost is correct based on the given problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles all test cases provided in the example.

Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
