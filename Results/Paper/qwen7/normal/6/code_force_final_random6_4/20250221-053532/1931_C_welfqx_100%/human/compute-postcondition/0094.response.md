Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop or condition being checked was exited. All other variables retain their previous states.
