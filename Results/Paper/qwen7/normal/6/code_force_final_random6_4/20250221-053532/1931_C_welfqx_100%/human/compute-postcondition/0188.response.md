Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the elements `num[i]` and `num[i + 1]` are not equal and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the conditions and values of `n` and the relationship between `num[i]` and `num[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
