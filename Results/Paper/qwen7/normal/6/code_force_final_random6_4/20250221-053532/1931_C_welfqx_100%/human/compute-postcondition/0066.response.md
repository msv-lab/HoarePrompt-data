Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `ii` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `ii` is 1.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 1.
   - Therefore, `1 < n - 1` must hold true.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `ii` will be incremented by 1, so `ii` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy `1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `ii` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `ii` is 2**
