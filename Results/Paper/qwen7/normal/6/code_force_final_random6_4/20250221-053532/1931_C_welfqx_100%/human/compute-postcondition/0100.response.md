Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.
