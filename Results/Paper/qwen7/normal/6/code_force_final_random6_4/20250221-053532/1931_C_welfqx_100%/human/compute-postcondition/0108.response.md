Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the reversed list `onum` to the variable `symb2`. Since `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb2` will be the last element of the original list `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
