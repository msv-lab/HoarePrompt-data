Output State: **`ii` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num` is a list or array where all elements from index 0 to `n-2` are checked for consecutive identical elements, `cn` is the total count of consecutive identical elements found during the entire loop execution, `r` is `n - 1`, and `t` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while all other variables (`ii`, `num`, `cn`, `r`, and `t`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
