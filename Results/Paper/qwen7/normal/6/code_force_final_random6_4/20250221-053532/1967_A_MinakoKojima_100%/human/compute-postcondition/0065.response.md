Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, and `ans` is `ans` + `dif`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif`. Since `dif` is defined as `a[5] - a[4]`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[5] - a[4]` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `dif`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
