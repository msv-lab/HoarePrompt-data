Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will contain a list `ans_list` where each element is calculated based on the given logic within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated according to the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`, the value of `k`, and the size of the list `n`. After processing all elements in the input as specified by the loop, `ans_list` will contain the cumulative result of `ans` for each input set processed.

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume we have processed `m` sets of inputs (where `m` is the total number of iterations the loop runs). For each set, the value of `ans` is updated based on the operations described in the loop, and then appended to `ans_list`. Therefore, `ans_list` will contain `m` elements, each representing the final value of `ans` for each respective input set.

In natural language, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop. Each element in `ans_list` represents the cumulative result after applying the specified operations on the input lists `a` for each set, with `k` and `n` being the key parameters influencing the final value of `ans`.
Code of the loop:
for a in ans_list:
    print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list with at least two elements

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an element from `ans_list`, `ans_list` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an element from `ans_list`, `ans_list` must contain at least one element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
