Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `res` is decremented by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was checking the condition `if k >= dif * 4`. The values of `i`, `k`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged, and the decrement operation on `res` is considered as completed before the break statement is executed.
