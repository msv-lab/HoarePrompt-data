Output State: **`i` is 7, `k` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is ans + (-1), `ans_list` contains ans + (-1), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user and splits them by space, converting each to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `i`, `k`, `res`, `ans`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 7, `k` is not 0, `res` is still -1, `ans` is still `ans + (-1)`, and `ans_list` contains `ans + (-1)`. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
