Output State: **`i` is 7, `k` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is ans + (-1), `ans_list` contains ans + (-1), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The variables `i`, `k`, `res`, `ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The newly created list `a` is populated with the integers entered by the user.
