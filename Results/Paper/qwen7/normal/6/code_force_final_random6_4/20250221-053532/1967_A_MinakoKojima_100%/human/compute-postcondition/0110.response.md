Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -1, `k` is less than `dif * 4`, `ans` is `k // 4`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `(i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 3, `(i + 1)` becomes 4. Since `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is 3, `k` is less than `dif * 4`. The value of `ans` is now `k // 4`, which is the integer division of `k` by 4. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `res`, and `k`) retain their previous conditions and values.
