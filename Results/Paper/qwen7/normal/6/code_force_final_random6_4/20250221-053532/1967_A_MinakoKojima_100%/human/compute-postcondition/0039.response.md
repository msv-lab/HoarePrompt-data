Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: According to the postcondition, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, the next value of `i` will be 2 or 3 respectively (assuming `n > 2`).

4. **Adjust the state based on the next value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 1, the next value will be 2.
   - If `i` was 2, the next value will be 3.

5. **Other variables' states remain unchanged**: According to the postcondition, `dif` retains its original value and is not 0, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 2, `k` is 0 if `i` is 1, and `res` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 2. These conditions will be applied when `i` takes its new value.

Given these points, we can now state the updated conditions for the next iteration:

- If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `i` was 2, it will become 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `dif` retains its original value and is not 0, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 3, `k` is 0 if `i` is 2, `res` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 3**
