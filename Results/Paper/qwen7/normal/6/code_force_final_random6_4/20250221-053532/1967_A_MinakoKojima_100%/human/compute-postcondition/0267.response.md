Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will contain a list `ans_list` where each element is calculated based on the given logic within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated according to the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`, the value of `k`, and the size of the list `n`. After processing all elements in the input as specified by the loop, `ans_list` will contain the cumulative result of `ans` for each input set processed.

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume we have processed `m` sets of inputs (where `m` is the total number of iterations the loop runs). For each set, the value of `ans` is updated based on the operations described in the loop, and then appended to `ans_list`. Therefore, `ans_list` will contain `m` elements, each representing the final value of `ans` for each respective input set.

In natural language, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop. Each element in `ans_list` represents the cumulative result after applying the specified operations on the input lists `a` for each set, with `k` and `n` being the key parameters influencing the final value of `ans`.
