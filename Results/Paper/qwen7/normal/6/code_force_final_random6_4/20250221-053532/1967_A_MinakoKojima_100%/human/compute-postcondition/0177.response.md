Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is ans + (-1), `ans_list` contains ans + (-1)**

Explanation: The line `ans_list.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` (which is `ans + (-1)`) to the list `ans_list`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `res`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
