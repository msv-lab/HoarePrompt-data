Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the for loop. This means the loop will iterate based on the input value provided.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 6
   - `k` is not 0
   - `res` is -1
   - `ans` is `ans + (-1)`
   - `ans_list` contains `ans + (-1)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more inputs to read from `int(input())`. Since the loop is defined by `range(int(input()))`, the loop will execute one more time if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0).
   - The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - The variable `res` remains -1 as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - The variable `ans` will be updated to `ans + (-1)` again.
   - The variable `ans_list` will contain the updated `ans + (-1)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` will be 7 (since it was 6 and is incremented by 1).
- `k` remains not 0.
- `res` remains -1.
- `ans` will be updated to `ans + (-1)`.
- `ans_list` will contain the updated `ans + (-1)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 7, `k` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is ans + (-1), `ans_list` contains ans + (-1)**
