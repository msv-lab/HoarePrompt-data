Postcondition: `i` is 3, `k` is not 0, `res` is `k % n`, `ans` is `ans + k // n`, and `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 3, `k` is confirmed to be non-zero, `res` is updated to `k % n`, `ans` is incremented by `k // n`, and `dif` remains as `a[5] - a[4]`.
