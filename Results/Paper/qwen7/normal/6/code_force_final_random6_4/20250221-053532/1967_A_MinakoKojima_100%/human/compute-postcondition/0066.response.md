Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is `-dif * 4`, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, and `ans` is `ans` + `dif`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4, so `k` is updated to `-dif * 4`. The values of `dif` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code.
