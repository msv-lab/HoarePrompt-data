Output: **a (where a is an element from ans_list)**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `a` is an element from `ans_list`.
- `ans_list` must contain at least one element, so `a` can be any one of the elements in `ans_list`.
- Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we describe it as "an element from `ans_list`".
- The print statement simply outputs the value of `a`.
- Therefore, the output will be the value of `a`, which is an element from `ans_list`.
