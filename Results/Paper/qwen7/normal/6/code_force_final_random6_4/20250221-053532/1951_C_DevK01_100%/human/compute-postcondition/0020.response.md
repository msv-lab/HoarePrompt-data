Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m` equals `k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
