Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the cost using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `N`, which consists of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. The value of `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, where `k` is the third element of the list `L`. The value of `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
