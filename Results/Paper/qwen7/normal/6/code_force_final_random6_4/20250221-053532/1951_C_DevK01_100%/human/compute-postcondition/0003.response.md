Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `M`. The initial value of `t` and the list `L` remain unchanged.
