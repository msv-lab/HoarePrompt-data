Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `M` is sorted, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, and we continue the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is calculated as follows: 
- If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
