Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - `n`: Number of days.
   - `m`: Maximum tickets that can be purchased per day.
   - `k`: Total number of tickets to be purchased.
   - `M`: List of ticket prices for each day.
   - `m = min(m, k)`: Ensures that `m` is not greater than `k`.

3. **Sorting Prices:**
   - `M.sort()`: Sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order.

4. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`: Determines the number of days required to purchase `k` tickets if `m` tickets can be bought each day.
   - `N = M[:q]`: Extracts the first `q` elements from the sorted list of prices.
   - `n = len(N)`: Calculates the length of the extracted list `N`.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy `k` tickets without any additional cost increase:
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: Computes the total cost.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost considering the additional increases in ticket prices:
     - `w = N.pop()`: Removes the last element from the list `N` (the highest price).
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: Calculates the remaining tickets to be bought after purchasing `m` tickets each day for `n-1` days.
     - `cost = mu * w`: Adds the cost of the remaining tickets at the current highest price.
     - `n = len(N)`: Updates the length of the list `N`.
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`: Adds the cost of the previously purchased tickets and the additional cost due to the increase in price.

6. **Output:**
   - Prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification:

Given the logic and the steps, the program seems to correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. It sorts the prices, calculates the necessary number of days to purchase the tickets, and accounts for the increasing prices correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended based on the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
