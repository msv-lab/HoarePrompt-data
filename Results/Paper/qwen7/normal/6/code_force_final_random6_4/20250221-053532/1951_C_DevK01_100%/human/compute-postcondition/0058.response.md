Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is calculated as follows: 
- If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
