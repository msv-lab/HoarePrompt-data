Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

In this output state, the variable `q` has been calculated as the ceiling of the division of `k` by `m`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
