Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `mu` as `k - (n - 1) * m`. Since `n` is the length of `N`, and `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` represents the number of elements in `N`. The value of `mu` is determined using the values of `k`, `n`, and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
