You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ \min(nm, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs to process. The variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` will be undefined or reset to their initial states for the last input, but since `t` is now 0, these variables will not be used further. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the program is ready to terminate.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, meaning no more inputs are left to process. All other variables (`L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost`) will either be undefined or will hold the final values from the last input processed before `t` became 0. The program will now terminate as there are no more inputs to handle.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of integers `a` and other integers `n`, `m`, and `k` derived from the list length and additional inputs. It returns a value based on specific conditions involving these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
