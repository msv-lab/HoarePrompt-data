Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now we know that `t` specifically holds the input integer value. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`) are not yet defined and retain their initial state as described in the precondition.
