To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\).
   - `L` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `M` is sorted.
   - `n` is the length of the sublist `N`.
   - `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, where `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`.

2. **Conditions for Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given these steps, let's analyze the conditions under which the cost is calculated:

- The exact values of `M`, `N`, `k`, `m`, and `q` are not provided, so we need to consider the general form of the cost calculation.
- The cost depends on the relationship between `n * m` and `k`.

Since the exact values of the variables are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost according to the given conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions described)**
