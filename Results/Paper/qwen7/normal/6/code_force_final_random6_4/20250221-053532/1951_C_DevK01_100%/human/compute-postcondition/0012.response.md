Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, and `n * m` equals `k`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `n` and `m` are already defined. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
