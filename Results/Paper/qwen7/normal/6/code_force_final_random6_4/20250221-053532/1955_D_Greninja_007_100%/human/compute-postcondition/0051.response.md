Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. It returns the value of `ans`, which is incremented as long as the sum of elements from list `a` up to index `r` (starting from 0) is greater than or equal to `k`, and the loop continues until `r` reaches `n-1`.**
