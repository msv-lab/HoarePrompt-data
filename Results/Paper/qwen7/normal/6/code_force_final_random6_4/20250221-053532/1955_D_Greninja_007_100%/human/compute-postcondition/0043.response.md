Postcondition: `ans` is 3, `sm` is `k`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, `m` must be less than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `ca[a[previous_r + 1]]` is incremented by 1, and if `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, the condition remains unchanged.
