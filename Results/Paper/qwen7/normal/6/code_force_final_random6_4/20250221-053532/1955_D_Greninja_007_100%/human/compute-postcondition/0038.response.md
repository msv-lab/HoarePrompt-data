Output State: **`ans` is 3, `sm` is `k + 1`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, `m` must be less than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `previous_r + 1`**

Explanation: The code `sm += 1` increments the value of `sm` by 1. Since `sm` was initially `k`, after the increment, `sm` becomes `k + 1`. All other variables (`ans`, `r`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions on `m` and `n` also remain the same.
