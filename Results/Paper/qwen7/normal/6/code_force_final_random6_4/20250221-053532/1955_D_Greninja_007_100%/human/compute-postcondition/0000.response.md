Output State: **`cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` is a list of m integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` sorts the list `b` and then creates a `Counter` object named `cb` that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
