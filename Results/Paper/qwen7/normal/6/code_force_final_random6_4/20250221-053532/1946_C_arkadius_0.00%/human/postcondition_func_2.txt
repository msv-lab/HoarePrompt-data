The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing a positive integer condition, and an integer `x` representing the size threshold for the connected components. It checks if the number of connected components in the tree with size greater than `x` is greater than `k`. If so, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns True if the number of such components equals `k` and the remaining size meets the threshold, or False if neither condition is met.
