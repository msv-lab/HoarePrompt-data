Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head:**
   - The loop iterates over `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.
   - Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `u`, `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].children`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects:**
   - `v` is the first element of the tuple `(v, True)` at the end of the stack.
   - `postorder` is the second element of the tuple `(v, True)` at the end of the stack.
   - `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children vertices of vertex `v`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element (i.e., the list must not be empty).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since `v` and `postorder` are derived from the tuple `(v, True)`, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The only object that needs adjustment is `tree.vertices[v].children`, which must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element**
