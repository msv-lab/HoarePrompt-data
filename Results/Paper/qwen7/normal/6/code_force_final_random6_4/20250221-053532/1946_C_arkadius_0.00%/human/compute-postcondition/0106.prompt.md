Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stack is a list containing one tuple `(s, False)`, tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` list of its child vertices, a `good_components` attribute initialized to 0, and a `remaining_size` attribute initialized to the size of the subtree rooted at that vertex, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The stack is a list containing tuples representing vertices from the tree. For the vertex `v` initially at the top of the stack, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated based on the remaining sizes of its child vertices relative to `x`. Specifically, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` (for a child vertex `u`) is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`; otherwise, it is incremented by 1. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices `u` of `v`. If the condition `postorder` is true, these updates are performed for each child vertex of `v`. If `postorder` is false, no changes are made to `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After the if-else block executes, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will count how many of `v`'s descendants have `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the total `remaining_size` of all such descendants.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop executes all iterations, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will hold the total count of good components from all children of node `v`, considering the size constraints. Specifically, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be increased by 1 if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` otherwise. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of remaining sizes of all children that meet the size constraint `x`. The `tree.vertices[v].children` list will be empty as all children have been processed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
