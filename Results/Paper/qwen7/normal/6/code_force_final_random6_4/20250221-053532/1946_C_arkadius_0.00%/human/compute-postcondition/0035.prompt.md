Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of a vertex from the tree and the second element is `False`. The tree remains an instance of a class representing a tree structure with each vertex having a `children` list of its child vertices, a `good_components` attribute initialized to 0, and a `remaining_size` attribute initialized to the size of the subtree rooted at that vertex. The vertex that initially started the process (denoted by `v`) is the first element of the first tuple in the stack, and it has been fully traversed such that all its children have been pushed onto the stack at least once. The postorder traversal has been initiated.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`) or by 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`). `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remains unchanged in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 2 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x` is true) or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (where u is the next child of v), and additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`), or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size < x`). In both cases, `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
