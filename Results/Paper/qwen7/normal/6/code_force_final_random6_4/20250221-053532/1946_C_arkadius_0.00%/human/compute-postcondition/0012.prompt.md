Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed; `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree; the Tree class instance `tree` has been initialized with `n` vertices.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
    tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that now includes an edge between vertex `u-1` and vertex `v-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `[u, v]` is a list containing two integers obtained from input, and a new edge `(u - 1, v - 1)` has been added to the tree.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` remains unchanged, `[u, v]` contains the integers u-1 and v-1, and a new edge (u-1, v-1) has been added to the tree.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
