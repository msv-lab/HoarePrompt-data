You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains unchanged, `[u, v]` contains the integers `u-1` and `v-1` which were provided as input during the last iteration, and the tree now includes all the edges specified by the inputs. The loop has executed `n-1` times, adding each of the `n-1` edges of the tree as per the given inputs.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where `tree` is the tree structure with `n` vertices, `n` is the number of vertices, and `k` is an unchanged parameter)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed; and `tree`, an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree. The function returns information based on the operations performed on the tree, specifically related to removing `k` edges.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
