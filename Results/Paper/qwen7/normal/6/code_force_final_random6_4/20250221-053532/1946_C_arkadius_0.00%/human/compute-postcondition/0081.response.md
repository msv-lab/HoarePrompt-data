Output State: The stack will contain a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(u, False)`. The number of tuples in the stack will be equal to the total number of descendants of vertex `v`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues to push `(u, False)` onto the stack for each child `u` of the current vertex `v`, and there is no condition to stop pushing children once a child is processed, the stack will eventually contain a tuple for each descendant of `v`. Therefore, the final state of the stack will include one tuple for every descendant of `v`, with each tuple being in the form `(u, False)`.
