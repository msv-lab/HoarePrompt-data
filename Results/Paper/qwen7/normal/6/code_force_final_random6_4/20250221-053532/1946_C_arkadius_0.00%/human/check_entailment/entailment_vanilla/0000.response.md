Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs the tree.
   - The function `func_5` handles the overall logic by calling other helper functions.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function seems to be incorrectly named and does not match the problem requirements. It appears to be trying to count good components and remaining sizes, but the logic is flawed.
   - **`func_2`**: This function correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `v`. However, it is called by `func_1`, which suggests it might be used incorrectly.
   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The logic here is also flawed because it uses `func_1` which is incorrect.
   - **`func_4`**: This binary search function tries to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining component with at least `x` vertices. The logic here is correct if the helper functions were working as intended.
   - **`func_5`**: This function handles the input and calls the necessary functions to solve the problem.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of good components and remaining size after removing edges, but the logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It should not be using `postorder` traversal for this purpose.
   - `func_2` is correctly calculating the number of good components and remaining size for a subtree, but it is being called incorrectly by `func_1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` which is incorrect. Instead, it should use `func_2` to get the correct counts and check if the conditions are met.

3. **Binary Search in `func_4`**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` is correct in terms of the approach, but it relies on the incorrect helper functions.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the helper functions (`func_1` and `func_3`), the program is not correctly solving the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
