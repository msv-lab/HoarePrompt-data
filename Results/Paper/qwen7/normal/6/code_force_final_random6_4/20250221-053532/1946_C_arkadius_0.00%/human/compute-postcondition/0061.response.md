Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is additionally increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'. In both cases, `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged.
