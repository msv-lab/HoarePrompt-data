### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

#### Function Summaries Recap
- **Function 5**: Handles input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
- **Function 4**: Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) by calling `func_3`.
- **Function 3**: Checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
- **Function 2**: Correctly calculates the number of good components and remaining size for a subtree.
- **Function 1**: Incorrectly named and flawed logic for counting good components and remaining sizes.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**
   - The program correctly reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges to be removed \( k \).
   - It constructs the tree by adding edges based on user input.
   - The function `func_5` handles the overall logic by calling other helper functions.

2. **Helper Functions**
   - **`func_2`**: Correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at \( v \).
   - **`func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to count good components and remaining sizes using a postorder traversal, which is not appropriate for this problem. The function should use a pre-order traversal or a different approach to correctly count the components and sizes.
   - **`func_3`**: This function should use `func_2` to get the correct counts and check if the conditions are met. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_3` will also produce incorrect results.
   - **`func_4`**: The binary search in `func_4` is correct in terms of the approach, but it relies on the incorrect helper functions (`func_1` and `func_3`).

Given these points, the core issue lies in the incorrect implementation of `func_1` and `func_3`. These functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and `func_3`, which are essential for determining the correct maximum \( x \).

Final: **False**
