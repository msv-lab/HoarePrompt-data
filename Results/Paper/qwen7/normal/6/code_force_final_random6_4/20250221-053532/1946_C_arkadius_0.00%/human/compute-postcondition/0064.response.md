Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components' is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components', and `tree.vertices[u].good_components' remains unchanged.** 

This means that the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to include the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. The value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` stays the same as it was before the operation.
