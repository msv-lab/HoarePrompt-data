Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed; `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree; the Tree class instance `tree` has been initialized with `n` vertices.**

In this case, the code initializes the `tree` variable as an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `tree` object now exists and can be used to manipulate the tree structure.
