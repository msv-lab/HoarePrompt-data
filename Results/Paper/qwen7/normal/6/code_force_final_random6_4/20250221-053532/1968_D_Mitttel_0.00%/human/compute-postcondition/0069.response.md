Output State: **`full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1`, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `current_pos` has been updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
