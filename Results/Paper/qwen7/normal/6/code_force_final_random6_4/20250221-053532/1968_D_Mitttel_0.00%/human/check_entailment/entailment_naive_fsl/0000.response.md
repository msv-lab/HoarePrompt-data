Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function does not handle the scenario where a player might move to their starting position during the game, which could potentially affect the final score. Additionally, the function does not account for the possibility of a player moving back to their starting position within a cycle, which could also impact the final score.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

However, the provided program does not correctly compute the scores for both players, leading to incorrect results. For instance, in the given example, the program might not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the moves and the scoring mechanism, resulting in an incorrect determination of the winner.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to accurately calculate the scores for both players under all possible scenarios.
