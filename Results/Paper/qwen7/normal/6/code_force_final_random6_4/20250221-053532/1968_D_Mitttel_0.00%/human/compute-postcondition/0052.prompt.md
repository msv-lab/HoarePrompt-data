You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive; a is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `PS` is now `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - 3 * n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - 3 * n` to `index - 3 * n + 3 * n` into integers.
    #
    #This output state describes the final condition of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The `index` variable will be at the position `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n` because it increments by 4 each iteration and by `2 * n` in total over 3 iterations. The `results` list will contain the return value of `func_1` three times since the loop appends the same result to the list in each iteration. The `PB`, `k`, `n`, `t`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` variables will reflect their values after the last iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list contains the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated nine times, `result` is the first element in the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), and two lists p and a (where p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array a, with each integer in both lists being between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
