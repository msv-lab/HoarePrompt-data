Output State: **`index` is `18 + 3 * n + 4`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 (integer value from `data[0]`), `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is now an integer value from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.**

Explanation: The line `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given that `index` was initially `18 + 2 * n + 4 + n`, after the increment, `index` becomes `18 + 3 * n + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
