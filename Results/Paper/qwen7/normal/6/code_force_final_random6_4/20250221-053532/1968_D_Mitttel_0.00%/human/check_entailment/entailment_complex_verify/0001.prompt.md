You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

The `results` list will contain the return value of `func_1` three times since the loop appends the same result to the list in each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for up to `k` turns.
   - It checks for cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation when the game enters a cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It correctly handles reading the input and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- **Cycle Detection**: The function correctly detects cycles in the permutation using a dictionary `visited` to track the steps taken.
- **Score Calculation**:
  - For non-cyclic parts, it simply adds the score for each turn.
  - For cyclic parts, it calculates the score for one cycle and multiplies it by the number of full cycles, then adds the score for the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Score Comparison**: The function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
- **Result Collection**: It collects the results for each test case and prints them.

### Correctness Check

1. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection logic is correct. It identifies cycles and handles them appropriately by calculating the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The use of `visited` to detect cycles is efficient and works as expected.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is correct for both non-cyclic and cyclic parts.
   - The function correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the input in chunks and processes each test case separately.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the required format, and the results are printed correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case. All functions handle the input and logic as specified in the problem statement.
