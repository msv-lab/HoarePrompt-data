Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for up to `k` turns.
   - It checks for cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation when the game enters a cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It correctly handles reading the input and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- **Cycle Detection**: The function correctly detects cycles in the permutation using a dictionary `visited` to track the steps taken.
- **Score Calculation**:
  - For non-cyclic parts, it simply adds the score for each turn.
  - For cyclic parts, it calculates the score for one cycle and multiplies it by the number of full cycles, then adds the score for the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Score Comparison**: The function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
- **Result Collection**: It collects the results for each test case and prints them.

### Correctness Check

1. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection logic is correct. It identifies cycles and handles them appropriately by calculating the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The use of `visited` to detect cycles is efficient and works as expected.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is correct for both non-cyclic and cyclic parts.
   - The function correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the input in chunks and processes each test case separately.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the required format, and the results are printed correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case. All functions handle the input and logic as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
