Output State: **`index` is `18 + 3 * n + 8 + n`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]` converted to an integer, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is now `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers, `a` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into integers using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
