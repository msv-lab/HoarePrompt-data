Output State: **The `results` list contains the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated nine times, `result` is the first element in the `results` list.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (which is 3 iterations as per the given information), the `results` list will have been appended to three times in each iteration. Therefore, the `results` list will contain the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` nine times. Since the loop iterates through the `results` list and prints each element, `result` will be set to the first element of the `results` list after the loop completes, which is the first instance of the function's return value added to the list.
