Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the scores for both players accurately by considering the permutation and the array `a`.
3. The `calculate_score` function within `func_1` handles both the non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios appropriately, ensuring that the score is calculated correctly even if a cycle is detected in the permutation.
4. The logic in `func_1` compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the correct result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on the comparison.
5. The main function `func_2` iterates through all test cases, calls `func_1` for each case, and prints the results.

Given the detailed analysis of the functions and the overall structure of the program, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected outputs based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
