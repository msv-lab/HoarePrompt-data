Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times.

When the `print(results[0])` statement is executed, it will print the first element of the `results` list, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Since the actual return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the function's parameters.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)**
