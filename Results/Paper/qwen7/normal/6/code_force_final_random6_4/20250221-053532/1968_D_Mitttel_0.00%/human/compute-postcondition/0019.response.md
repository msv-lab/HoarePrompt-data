Output State: **`index` is \(18 + n + n\), `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 (integer value from `data[0]`), `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers, `n` is now the integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` changes the value of `n` to the integer value at the position specified by `index` in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
