Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `start_pos`. It returns the value of `score`, which is updated based on the following conditions:**

- If the function calculates the score by adding the value of `a[start_pos - 1]` to the original score.
- If the function calculates the score by adding the value of `a[start_pos - 1]` and `a[current_pos - 1]` to the score.
- If the function updates the score by adding the value at index `current_pos - 1` in the list `a`.
- If a cycle is detected during the process, the function returns the accumulated score up to the point of detection; otherwise, it returns the updated score, which is the sum of `score` and `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration from `remainder_steps` down to 1.
