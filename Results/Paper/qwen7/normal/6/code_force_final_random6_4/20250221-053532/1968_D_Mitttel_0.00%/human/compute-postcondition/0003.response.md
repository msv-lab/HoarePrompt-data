Output State: **`index` is 0; `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer. Since `index` is 0, `t` becomes the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The value of `index` remains unchanged at 0.
