Output State: **`index` is 18, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` extracts a slice of the `data` list starting from `index` and having a length of `n`, then converts each element in this slice to an integer using the `map` function, and finally converts the map object to a list. The new list `p` is created, and the original values of other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `index` is 9, the slice starts at `data[9]` and has a length of `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `9 + n`, which is 18 if `n` is 9.
