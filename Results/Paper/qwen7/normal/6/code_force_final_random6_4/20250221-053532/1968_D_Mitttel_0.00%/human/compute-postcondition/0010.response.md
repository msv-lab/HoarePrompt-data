Output State: **`index` is 5, `PB` is an integer value from `data[5]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `PS` is an integer value from `data[8]`**.

Explanation: The code `PS = int(data[index + 3])` updates the variable `PS` by converting the element at index `index + 3` (which is 8) in the `data` list to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
