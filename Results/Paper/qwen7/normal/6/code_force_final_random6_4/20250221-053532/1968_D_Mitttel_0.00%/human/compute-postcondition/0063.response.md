Output State: **`full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` remains unchanged, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `current_pos` to the next position within the cycle by assigning `p[current_pos - 1]` to `current_pos`. The values of `full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `remainder_steps`, `score`, and `cycle_score` remain unchanged.
