Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads all input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the result of splitting the input string.
