Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `word` is either "zz", 'aay', or 'aaa'
   - `i` is 1

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `int(input())` is unknown, but it must be greater than the current value of `i` (which is 2) for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `word` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is either "zz" or 'aay' or 'aaa', and `i` is 2**.
