To determine what will be printed, let's break down the conditions and the value of `word` based on the given initial state:

1. **Value of `n`:**
   - If `n > 52`, then `word = 'zz'`.
   - If `n > 27`, then `word = 'az'`.
   - If `n == 27`, then `word = 'aay'`.
   - If `n <= 26`, then `word = 'aaa'`.

2. **Value of `word`:**
   - Since `word` depends on the value of `n`, we need to consider the possible ranges for `n` to determine the exact value of `word`.

Given the ranges:
- If `n > 52`, `word` is 'zz'.
- If `27 < n <= 52`, `word` is 'az'.
- If `n == 27`, `word` is 'aay'.
- If `n <= 26`, `word` is 'aaa'.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `word`. However, based on the ranges, the possible values of `word` are 'zz', 'az', 'aay', or 'aaa'.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `n`, we need to consider the general case where `n` falls into one of these ranges. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n according to the given conditions)**
