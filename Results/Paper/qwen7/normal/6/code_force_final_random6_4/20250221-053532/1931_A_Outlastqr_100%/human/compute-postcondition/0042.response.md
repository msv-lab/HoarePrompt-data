Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az', and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` to the string `word`. Given that `n` is an input integer, the exact character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28` is appended between `'a'` and `'z'`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character. However, we know that `word` will be `'az'` followed by the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
