Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `word` is defined based on the value of `n`:
     - `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` if `n > 52`,
     - `'aay'` if `n = 27`,
     - `'aaa'` repeated `n` times if `n < 27`,
     - `'az'` if `27 < n \leq 52`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged because it is determined by user input and not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `word` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `int(input())` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above steps, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer, `word` is defined based on the value of `n` as described, `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume the initial values were:
- `t = 50`
- `n = 30`
- `word = 'aaazzz'` (since \(27 < 30 \leq 52\))

After one iteration, the state would be:
- `i = 1`
- `int(input())` remains the same.

So, the final state for the next iteration would be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer, `word` is defined based on the value of `n` as described, `i` is 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**
