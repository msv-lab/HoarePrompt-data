Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is updated to an input integer, which is a positive integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be a positive integer) to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
