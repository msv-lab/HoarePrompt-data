Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is "zz", and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the `word` string. However, since `word` was initially an empty string (`""`), after this operation, `word` becomes `"zz"`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
