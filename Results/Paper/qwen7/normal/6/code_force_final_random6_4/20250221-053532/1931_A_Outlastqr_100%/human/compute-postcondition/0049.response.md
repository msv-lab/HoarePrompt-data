Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is either 'aay', 'aaa', or 'az'. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 27, `word` is 'az'. If `n` equals 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aaa'.
