Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal game score. The program attempts to count how many unique elements have appeared exactly once in the array `a`. However, this approach does not account for the different strategies of Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the MEX is calculated correctly based on the optimal moves of both players.
2. The program does not handle the turns of Alice and Bob properly. It simply counts occurrences of each number in the array and prints the first index `i` where either `t >= 2` (which should be `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`) or `cnt[i] == 1` after the loop completes. This logic does not reflect the game's rules or the optimal strategies of the players.
3. The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob to ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. Instead, it provides a simple count-based check which is insufficient for solving the problem as stated.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
