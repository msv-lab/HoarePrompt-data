Output State: **`i` is less than `N`, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1; `t` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `cnt[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still less than `N`, and the value of `cnt[i]` remains 1.
