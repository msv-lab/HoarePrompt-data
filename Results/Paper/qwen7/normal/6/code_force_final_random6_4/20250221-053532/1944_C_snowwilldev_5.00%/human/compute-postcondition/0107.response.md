Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < N`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `N`.
   - If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1.
   - The current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < N`, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `N`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - The postcondition needs to be checked for the new value of `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
- `N` remains the same.
- The postcondition must still hold true for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is less than `N`, and if `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1. The current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
