Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the objective of finding the MEX of the array \( c \) at the end of the game. Here's why:

1. **Game Rules and Objective**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array \( a \).
   - Alice appends the chosen element to her array \( c \) and removes it from \( a \).
   - Bob only removes the chosen element from \( a \).
   - The game ends when \( a \) is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of \( c \) at the end of the game, considering optimal play from both players.

2. **Current Program Logic**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in \( a \) using a dictionary `cnt`.
   - It then iterates through the elements of \( a \) and checks if there is an element that appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`).
   - If such an element is found, it prints the index \( i \) and breaks the loop.
   - This logic does not simulate the game or calculate the MEX of the final array \( c \).

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of \( c \).
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of \( c \).
   - The current program does not account for these strategic considerations.

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
