Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `N` is an input integer, `i` remains as `N-1` throughout all iterations, `t` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions and the loop's execution), and `tc` is `tc + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `N`, `i`, `t`, and `tc` remain unchanged from their initial states.
