You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1, `i` is equal to `N`, and `N` is greater than 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `N-1` and then continues until the loop condition is no longer satisfied. Given that the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early due to `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, `t` remains 1 (as it was incremented once when `cnt[2]` was 1, assuming `cnt[2]` was the last element checked before the loop condition was met). The value of `N` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and has not been modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers, and an integer \( t \) such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 \). For each test case, it prints an integer \( i \) that meets specific conditions related to the count of occurrences of each element in the list \( a \). If no such \( i \) exists, it prints nothing. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to her array `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, considering both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program attempts to count the occurrences of each element in `a` using a dictionary (`cnt`).
   - It then iterates through the elements of `a` and checks conditions to print an index.
   
3. **Issues with the Given Program:**
   - The program does not simulate the game properly. It only counts the occurrences of each element and prints an index without considering the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The logic to determine the optimal MEX value is missing. The current implementation simply prints an index based on the count of elements, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves.
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available index to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will pick the next smallest available index to minimize the MEX.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `n` is even, Alice can always pick the smallest index, and Bob will pick the next smallest index, resulting in the MEX being `n // 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, the same logic applies, but the MEX will be `(n + 1) // 2`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
