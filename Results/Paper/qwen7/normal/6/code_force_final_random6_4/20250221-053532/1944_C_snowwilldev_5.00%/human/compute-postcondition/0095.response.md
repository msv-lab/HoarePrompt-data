Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `N + 1`.
   - `N` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the loop condition.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(N)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `N + 1`, it is not less than `N`, so the loop will not execute based on the current state.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be less than `N`.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `t`, `tc`, `a`, and `cnt[a[2]]` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than `N`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `N`**
