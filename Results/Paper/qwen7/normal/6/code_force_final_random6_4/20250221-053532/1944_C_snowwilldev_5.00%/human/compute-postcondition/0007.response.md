Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < N`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The increment of `cnt[a[i]]` happens within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change the value of `cnt[a[i]]` yet. It will be updated during the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` will be 1.
   - The variable `cnt[a[i]]` will be incremented during the next iteration, but its exact value is not specified, so we do not need to change it in the state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1**
