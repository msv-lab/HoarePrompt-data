Output State: **`i` is a character and its value is '-', `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `neg` is 1.**

The code `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Since `neg` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing the code, `neg` becomes 1. The values of `i`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
