Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `neg` is 2 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 1.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `s`. Since `i` is the next character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be the current character in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `a`, `x`, and `neg` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is the next character in the string `s`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, and `neg` is 2 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 1**.
