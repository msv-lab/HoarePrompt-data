Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the current implementation:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - Split `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - Output the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1()` only counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and prints a value based on the condition `n - 2 * neg` or `n` if `n == neg`.
   - This does not account for splitting the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The logic provided does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to achieve the minimum penalty.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
