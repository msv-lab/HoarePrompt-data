Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, and `neg` is equal to the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., once for each character in the string `s`), the variable `neg` will hold the count of all '-' characters in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `a`, and `x`) will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being the last character of the string `s`.
