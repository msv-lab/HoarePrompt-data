Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mx` is 6
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is at least 3
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 6
   - `i` is 3

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition involves the variables `i` and `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be true.

4. **Evaluate the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `x` is at least 3.

5. **Calculate the required condition**:
   - Substitute `i = 3` into the loop condition: `2 ** (3 + 1) <= x + 1` simplifies to `2 ** 4 <= x + 1`, which is `16 <= x + 1` or `x >= 15`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `x` must be at least 15 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - Other variables (`mx`, `t`, `subseq_lens`, and `i`) do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `x` being at least 15.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 15, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 6, `i` is 3**
