Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 31, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 6, `i` is 6**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `subseq_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `subseq_lens` now contains the value 6, while `mx`, `t`, `x`, and `i` retain their original values.
