Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mx` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an input integer - 1 and `x` must not be 0
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list
   - `i` is 1

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Check the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

5. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values**:
   - Substitute `i = 1` into the loop condition: `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x + 1` simplifies to `2 ** 2 <= x + 1` or `4 <= x + 1`.
   - This further simplifies to `3 <= x`.

6. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be true.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - Substituting `i = 2` into the loop condition: `2 ** (2 + 1) <= x + 1` simplifies to `8 <= x + 1` or `7 <= x`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the loop condition holds true for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer - 1 and `x` must not be 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` must be 2**
