Output State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 29 - (2 ** 11 - 1), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 11, `i` is 11**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from its current value. Given that `i` is initially 11, the expression `2 ** i - 1` evaluates to \(2^{11} - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047\). Therefore, `x` is now at least \(29 - 2047 = -2018\). All other variables remain unchanged.
