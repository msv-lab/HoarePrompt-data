Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mx` is 6
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is at least 29
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 6
   - `i` is 1

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition involves `i` and `x`. Therefore, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be satisfied.
   - If `i` is 1, then `2 ** (i + 1)` becomes `2 ** 2 = 4`. So, the condition simplifies to `4 <= x + 1`.
   - This further simplifies to `x >= 3`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` was 1 and needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` should be set to 2.
   - `x` must satisfy the condition `x >= 3` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 3, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 6, `i` is 2**
