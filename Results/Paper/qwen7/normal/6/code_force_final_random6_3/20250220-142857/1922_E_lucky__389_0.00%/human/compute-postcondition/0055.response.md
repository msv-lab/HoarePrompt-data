Output State: **`mx` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 4, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value (6) and the value of `i` (4). Since 6 is greater than 4, `mx` remains 6. However, the given answer shows `mx` as 4, which seems to be incorrect based on the logic. Given the initial state, `mx` should remain 6 after executing the code. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `i`) are not affected by the code.
