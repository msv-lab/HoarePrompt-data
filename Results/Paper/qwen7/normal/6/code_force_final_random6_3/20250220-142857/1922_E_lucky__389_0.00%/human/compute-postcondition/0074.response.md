Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is 6
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `x` is 13
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4
- `i` is 3
- `len(ansv)` must be at least 2

The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ansv[i]`. Since `i` is 3, it implies that `ansv` must have at least 4 elements (as `len(ansv)` is at least 2 and `i` is 3). However, the value of `ansv` itself is not provided directly.

Given the information, we can infer that `ansv` is a list and `ansv[3]` is the fourth element of this list. Without the explicit value of `ansv`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ansv[3]`.

Output: **ansv[3]**
