Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to be its sorted version.
