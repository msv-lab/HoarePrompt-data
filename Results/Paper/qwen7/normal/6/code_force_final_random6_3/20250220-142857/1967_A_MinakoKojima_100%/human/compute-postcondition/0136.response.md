Output State: **`ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `res += k % (i + 1)` increases the value of `res` by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, `dif`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
