Output State: **`ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` has not been decreased by 1, there is no change in the postcondition if `dif` does not equal 0, and the condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)` is satisfied.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
