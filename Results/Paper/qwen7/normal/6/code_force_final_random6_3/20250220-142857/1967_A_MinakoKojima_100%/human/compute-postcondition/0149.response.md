Output State: **`i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[a[i + 1] - a[i]]`**

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is `x + 2`. The initial value of `n` is `y`. The initial value of `dif` is `a[x + 3] - a[x + 2]`. After executing the line `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]`, the value of `i` remains unchanged as `x + 2`. The value of `dif` is updated to `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, which simplifies to `a[(x + 2) + 1] - a[x + 2]` or `a[x + 3] - a[x + 2]`. However, since `dif` was initially defined as `a[x + 3] - a[x + 2]`, the new value of `dif` is simply `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.
