Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -2, `k` is 0, `ans` is `dif`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. Given that `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and `dif`. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value of `dif`. All other variables remain unchanged.
