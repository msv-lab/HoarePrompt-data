Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -2, `k` is `k - dif * 3`, `ans` is `2 * dif`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)`, which is `dif * 3`, from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is now `k - dif * 3`.
