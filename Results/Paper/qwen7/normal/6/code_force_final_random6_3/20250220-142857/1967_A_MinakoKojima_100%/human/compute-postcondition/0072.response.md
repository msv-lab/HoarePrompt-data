Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by either 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` or 7 depending on the value of `k`, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `k` is either decreased by `dif * (i + 1) * 2` or set to 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1.
