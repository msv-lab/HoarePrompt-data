Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is now equal to `a[0]`, `res` is a non-negative integer which has been decremented by `N-1` and is now `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `k // N`, `ans_list` contains the current value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `i` is `i + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `dif` remains `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then `res` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, and `k` is equal to 0. If `dif` equals 0, then `res` is decreased by 1, and there is no change in `ans` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, and if `dif` is not equal to 0, `ans` is updated as follows: if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif` and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[a[i + 1] - a[i]]`, `ans` is either `ans + dif` or increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `res` is adjusted based on whether `i` is 0 or not: if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`; otherwise, `res` is decreased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
