Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is either `dif` or 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there are no loops or conditions in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `dif`, `res`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
