Based on the initial state provided, `ans_list` must have at least three elements, and `a` is the third element of `ans_list`. Since the exact value of `ans_list` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know it is the third element of `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the third element of ans_list)**
