Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `dif` to be the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `dif` is set to `a[2] - a[1]`. The other variables (`n`, `res`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
