Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 4, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is equal to `ans` plus `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially a non-negative integer decreased by 3, after this operation, `res` will be a non-negative integer decreased by 4. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `ans`, `k`, and `dif`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
