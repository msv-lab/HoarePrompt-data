Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**.

This means that the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its original value. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, and `ans`) retain their previous values.
