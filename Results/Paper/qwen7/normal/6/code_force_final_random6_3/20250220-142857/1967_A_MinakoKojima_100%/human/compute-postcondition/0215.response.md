Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `dif` is 0
   - `res` is -1
   - `k` is 0
   - `ans` is 0
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is if `dif` is not equal to 0.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop is `for i in range(n - 1)`, the loop will increment `i` by 1 each time it iterates.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue. Given that `i` is incremented from 0 to 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

6. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `dif`, `res`, `k`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is 0, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0**
