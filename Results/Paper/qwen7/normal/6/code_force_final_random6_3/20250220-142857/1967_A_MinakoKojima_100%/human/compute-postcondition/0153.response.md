Output State: **`i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[a[i + 1] - a[i]]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += dif` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dif` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans` being increased by `dif`.
