Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n`, `b` is an input string of length `n`, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is 1, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, now it contains one element, which is the result of the function call. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
