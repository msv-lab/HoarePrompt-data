### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if there exists a template \( t \) such that:
1. Both strings \( a \) and \( b \) match the template \( t \).
2. String \( c \) does not match the template \( t \).

A template \( t \) can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters. If \( t \) has an uppercase letter at position \( i \), then \( c[i] \) must be different from the lowercase version of \( t[i] \). If \( t \) has a lowercase letter at position \( i \), then \( c[i] \) must be the same as \( t[i] \).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` currently checks if there is at least one position where \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) do not match \( c[i] \). This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a valid template. It does not check if the template allows \( a \) and \( b \) to match while disallowing \( c \).

Here's a breakdown of the function:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
- The function iterates over each position \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- If at any position \( i \), \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) and \( b[i] \neq c[i] \), it returns 'YES'.
- If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  3
  abb
  abb
  abb
  3
  aab
  aab
  aab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  ```

For the first test case:
- \( a = "abb" \)
- \( b = "abb" \)
- \( c = "abb" \)

The function `func_1` returns 'YES' because \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) and \( b[i] \neq c[i] \) for all \( i \). However, there is no valid template that would make \( a \) and \( b \) match while making \( c \) not match, since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are identical.

For the second test case:
- \( a = "aab" \)
- \( b = "aab" \)
- \( c = "aab" \)

The function `func_1` returns 'YES' because \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) and \( b[i] \neq c[i] \) for all \( i \). Again, there is no valid template that would make \( a \) and \( b \) match while making \( c \) not match, since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are identical.

#### Correctness of the Given Code:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches both \( a \) and \( b \) but not \( c \). The function `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where \( a[i] \) and \( b[i] \) do not match \( c[i] \), which is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the required logic, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
