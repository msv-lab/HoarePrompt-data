You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). For each set, it calls another function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and stores the result. After processing all sets, it prints the results of these function calls. The final state of the program includes \( t \) being 0, and the variables \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) holding the last set of inputs provided.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters, with specific matching rules.
   
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`.
   - If such an index exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - However, this function only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same index. It does not ensure that `a` and `b` match some template and `c` does not.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match and `c` does not.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not cover this requirement. It only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same index, which is insufficient.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to construct a template character by character, ensuring that for each position `i`:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]` and `a[i] != c[i]`, then the template character should be `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - If `a[i] != b[i]` and `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]`, then the template character should be `a[i]` or `b[i]` respectively.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the template character should be `a[i]` or `b[i]` such that the template does not match `c`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
