Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, a is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, b is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, c is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, a, b, c) for each iteration from 1 to t, _ is t.**

In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution. The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
