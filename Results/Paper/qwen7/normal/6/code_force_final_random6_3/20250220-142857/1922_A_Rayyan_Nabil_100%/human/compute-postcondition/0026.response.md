Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for result in results:` statement. The only variable involved here is `result`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is the length of the `results` list.
   - `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t-1`.
   - `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `result` is being used in the loop, it will be updated to the next element in the `results` list.
   - The length of the `results` list (`t`) will decrease by 1 because one element has been processed.
   - The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` will be `t - 1` (since one element has been processed).
   - `result` will be the next element in the `results` list.
   - `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the next element in the `results` list, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**.
