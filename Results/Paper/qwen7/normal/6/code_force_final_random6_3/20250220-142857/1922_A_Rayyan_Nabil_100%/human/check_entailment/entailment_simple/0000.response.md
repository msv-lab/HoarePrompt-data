Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` up to length `n`.
   - It checks if for each index `i`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
   - If such an index `i` is found where both conditions hold, it immediately returns `'YES'`.
   - If no such index is found after checking all characters, it returns `'NO'`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the functions appears to be correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
