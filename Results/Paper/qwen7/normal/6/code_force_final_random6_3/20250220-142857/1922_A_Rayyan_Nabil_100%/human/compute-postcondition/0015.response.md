Output State: **`n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string after stripping, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `t` is one less than its previous value**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` reads an input string, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. This integer is assigned to `n`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `results`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
