Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` must be strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `_` is now 1**

The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` must still be strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` remains an empty list, and `_` is still 1.
