Output State: **`n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `t` is one less than its previous value, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes a new input string, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `results`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
