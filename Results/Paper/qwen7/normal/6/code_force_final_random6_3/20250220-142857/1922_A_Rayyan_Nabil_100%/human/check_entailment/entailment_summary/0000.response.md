Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that two strings (a and b) match it, but another string (c) does not.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to check if for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` is true. If this condition holds for all indices, it means both `a` and `b` match the template derived from `c`. However, the function only checks if there is at least one index where this condition fails, which is not sufficient to determine the existence of a template.
3. The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each set of inputs and storing the results. It then prints the results for each test case.
4. The `func_1` function, however, does not fully address the problem requirements. It only checks if there is at least one index where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, which is not enough to ensure that a template exists. Instead, it should check if it's possible to create a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
5. The correct approach would involve checking if for each character in `a` and `b`, there is a corresponding character in `c` that allows the creation of a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
