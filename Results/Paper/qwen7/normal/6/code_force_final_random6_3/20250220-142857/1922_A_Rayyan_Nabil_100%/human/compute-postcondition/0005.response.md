Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n`, `b` is an input string of length `n`, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 1**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `b` is the stripped input string of length `n`.
