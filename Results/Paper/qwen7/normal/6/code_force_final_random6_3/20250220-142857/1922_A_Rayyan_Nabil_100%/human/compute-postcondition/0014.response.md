Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable mentioned here is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are provided:
   - `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is the input string after stripping.
   - `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended.
   - `_` is 1 (though this is a dummy variable used for iteration).

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a dummy variable, it does not change within the loop. The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left, which is represented by `t`.

4. **Update the State**: To allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given these points, the updated state should reflect that `t` is now one less than its previous value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string after stripping, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `t` is one less than its previous value**.
