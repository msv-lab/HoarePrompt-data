Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum cost.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity, which is a good choice to find the minimum value.
   - It iterates backward through the list from `n-1` to `0`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the accumulated cost `x` plus `a[i]`.
     - It accumulates the cost `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints the minimum cost stored in `pergunta`.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost to move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`) is `a[j]`.
  - For each intermediate position `k` (where `j < k < i`), the cost is `b[k]`.
- **Backward Iteration:**
  - The program correctly iterates backward, ensuring that the cost is accumulated correctly.
- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if i < m:` ensures that only positions within the desired range are considered for updating the minimum cost.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases well, such as when `m` is 1 or when `m` is equal to `n`.
- The use of `float('inf')` for initialization ensures that the minimum cost is correctly updated.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. The implementation matches the problem description and handles all necessary conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
