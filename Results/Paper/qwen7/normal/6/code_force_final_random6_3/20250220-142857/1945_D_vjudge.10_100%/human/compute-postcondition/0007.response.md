Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `x += min(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. The conditions for updating `pergunta` remain the same, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is only checked against `m` for further updates.
