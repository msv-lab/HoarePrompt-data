You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of integers where a_i and b_i represent the costs for Kirill to move past the i-th person in the queue, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the lengths of a and b are both equal to n.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `pergunta` will hold the smallest possible value of `x + a[i]` encountered during the loop, and `x` will be the cumulative sum of the smaller cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` down to `m`.

    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value of x + a[i] encountered during the loop)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position `m`. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - According to the problem description, the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first two positions would be calculated as follows:
    - To move from position 3 to position 2: Cost = `b[2] = 3`
    - To move from position 2 to position 1: Cost = `a[1] = 7`
  - Therefore, the total cost should be `3 + 7 = 10`.

- **Actual Output:**
  - Running the provided program with the above input gives an output of `14`, which is incorrect.

### Detailed Explanation:
The issue lies in how the program accumulates the cost. The variable `x` is being incremented by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each position `i` in reverse order. However, this does not correctly reflect the cost structure described in the problem statement. Specifically, the cost of bribing someone at position `k` (where `j < k < i`) should be added to the total cost only if Kirill moves past that person.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly accumulate the costs based on the described rules. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
    print(pergunta)
```

However, even with this correction, the program still does not fully implement the logic correctly. A more accurate implementation would involve keeping track of the cumulative cost and ensuring that the cost of bribing intermediate people is correctly accounted for.
