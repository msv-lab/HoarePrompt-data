Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`
- `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` as `n-1`.
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `-1`.

2. **Variable `pergunta`:**
   - `pergunta` is updated based on the values of `x` and `a[i]` in the loop body.
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `pergunta` after the loop body, we keep it as is.

3. **Variable `x`:**
   - `x` is updated based on the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` in the loop body.
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `x` after the loop body, we keep it as is.

4. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop body unless explicitly modified.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- Since the loop is decrementing `i` from `n-1` to `-1`, the next iteration will start with `i` being `n-2`.
- `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged because their values are determined by the loop body, and we don't have information about the exact changes made in the loop body.
- `n` remains unchanged as per the given condition.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be `n-2`.
- `pergunta` remains the same (minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`).
- `x` remains the same (`x + min(a[i], b[i])`).
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
