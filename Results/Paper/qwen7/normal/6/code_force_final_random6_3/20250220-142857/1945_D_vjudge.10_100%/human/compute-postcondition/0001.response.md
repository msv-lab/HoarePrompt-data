Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop.
   - The loop runs from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts at `n-1` and goes down to `-1`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i >= 0`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts at `n-1` and remains non-negative throughout the loop.
   - The other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `x`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
