Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of integers where a_i and b_i represent the costs for Kirill to move past the i-th person in the queue, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the lengths of a and b are both equal to n; x is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `x` to 0. The values of `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
