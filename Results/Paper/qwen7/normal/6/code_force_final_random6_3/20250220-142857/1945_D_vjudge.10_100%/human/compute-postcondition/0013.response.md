Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`
   - `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `n-3`.
   - The values of `pergunta` and `x` depend on the loop body, but since no specific operations are mentioned, we assume they remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Given the information provided, we can conclude that the only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to update `i` to `n-3`.

**State: **`i` is `n-3`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`**
