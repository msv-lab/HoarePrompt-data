Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. If `lit[3]` is greater than `x` and `x` is infinity (indicating `a` is empty), then `a` is updated to include `lit[3]` as its last element, and `x` becomes the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.
