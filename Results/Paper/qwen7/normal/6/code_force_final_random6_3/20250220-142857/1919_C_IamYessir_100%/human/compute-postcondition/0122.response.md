Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]` and `lit[3]` is greater than `y`, then `a` has the last element of the original `a` appended with `lit[3]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity. If the condition `x >= lit[3] and lit[3] > y` is not met, then the values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged, and `x` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.
