Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, if the list `b` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of list `b`, if the list `a` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of list `a`, `a` now contains the element `lit[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[3]` (since `i` is 3) to the list `a`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `b`, or `x`. The conditions for `x` remain the same unless `a` was empty and now contains an element, making `x` the last element of `a`.
