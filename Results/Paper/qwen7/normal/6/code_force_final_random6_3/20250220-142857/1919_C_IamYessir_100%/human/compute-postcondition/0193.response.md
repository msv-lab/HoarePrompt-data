Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
