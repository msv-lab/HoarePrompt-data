Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged; `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code assigns `float('inf')` to `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, or the conditions related to the lists `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial postconditions and adds that `y` is now infinity.
