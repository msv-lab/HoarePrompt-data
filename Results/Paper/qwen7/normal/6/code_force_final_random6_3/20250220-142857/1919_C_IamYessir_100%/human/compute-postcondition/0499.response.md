Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(b))`.

2. **Determine Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be set to 1 initially.

3. **Determine Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - This means `i` should be less than `len(b)` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Initial State of `b`:**
   - Since `b` is used in the loop condition and inside the loop body, it must be non-empty for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Therefore, `b` must have at least one element.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `x` are not directly involved in the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be set to 1.
- `b` must have at least one element.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element**
