Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` contains the element `lit[3]`, `b` is unchanged, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` (where `i` is 3) to the list `a`. Since `i` is 3, `a` now contains the element `lit[3]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The list `b` remains unchanged as well. The value of `x` is determined by the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity, which aligns with the initial postcondition.
