Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `s` will be the count of elements in `a` where each element is greater than its predecessor. The lists `a` and `b` will retain their final states based on the conditions specified within the loop, with `b` containing all elements of `lit` that satisfy the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` for some `i`. Variables `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` will remain in their initial or unchanged states as per the problem description. `x` will be equal to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise it will be positive infinity. `y` will be positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise it will be the smallest element in `b`. `s` represents the total count of increasing pairs in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after running the loop through all iterations, `i` will be the last index of list `a`, `s` will count how many times an element in `a` is larger than the previous one, and `x` and `y` will reflect the maximum and minimum values in `b` (if `b` is not empty), or positive infinity if `b` is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element, and either `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` in which case `s` is 1, or there is no else part specified, so the conditions remain as they are.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `b` must have at least one element. If `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `s` is set to 2. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `b` must have at least one element, and `s` is 2. If the element at index `i` in list `b` is greater than the element at index `i - 1`, then the condition is met as is. If not, the condition still holds with the same values for `i`, `b`, and `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
