Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cp` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `lit` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty). If `x > y`, then `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]` if `lit[0] > y` or if `y >= lit[0] > x`. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `lit[0]` if `y < lit[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; if `x > y`, then `b` now contains the element from `a` at index `i-1` if `y >= lit[i]`, or the element from list `a` at index `i-1` if `lit[i] > x`; otherwise, if `x <= y`, then `a` is modified to contain the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original list `a` if `x == y`, or `a` contains the last element of `a` appended with the element at index `i-1` of the original `a` if `x < y`, and `b` remains unchanged if `x >= y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. If `x` is infinity, it remains unchanged. If `x` is not infinity, then `x` is updated to `lit[3]` if `a` is not empty, `a` contains `lit[3]` as its last element, and `x` is less than `y` and `lit[3]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
