Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and `b` now has an additional element at its last position which is equal to `lit[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the end of list `b`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` before the append operation, after appending, `i` will be one more than the new length of list `b`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
