Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `s` is the count of consecutive elements in list `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` is greater than `y`, and the last element of list `b` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` remains unchanged as the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and list `a` gains a new element equal to `lit[i]`, provided that `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, the last element of list `a` is appended to list `a`, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b` if the length of list `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is appended to list `a`, and `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`. If appending `x` to list `a` and `lit[i]` being greater than `y` results in `y` being strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` not being greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` becoming the last element of list `b`, then `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to the last element of list `b`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` equals the last element of list `b`, `lit[i]` is set to the last element of list `b`, and the last element of list `b` is appended to list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` and `y` are both infinity. If `len(a)` is not 0 and `x > y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `b` has an additional element which is the same as `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x == y`, `b` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it; otherwise, `a` is updated by appending `b[i]` to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1 or `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 2, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `b` is updated such that its last element is set to `lit[i-1]` and `i` is incremented to the length of list `b` + 2. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `a` is updated such that its last element is set to `lit[i]`. If `x == y`, then `a` now has its last element appended with the element from `lit` at index `i-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
