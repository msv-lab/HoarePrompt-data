Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, `y` is positive infinity, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code sets `y` to `float('inf')`, which means `y` is now positive infinity. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
