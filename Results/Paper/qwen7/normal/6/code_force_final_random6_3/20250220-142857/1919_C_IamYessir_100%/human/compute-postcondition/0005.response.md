Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is the integer input from the user.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial state:
- `cp` is 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the integer input from the user.
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `b` is an empty list.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
