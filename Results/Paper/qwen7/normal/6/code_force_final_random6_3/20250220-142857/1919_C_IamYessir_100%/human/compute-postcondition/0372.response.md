Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is a list with at least zero elements, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and the value of `x` is greater than `y`. Additionally, the condition `y >= lit[i]` is satisfied.
