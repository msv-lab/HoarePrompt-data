Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `lit[0]` with `x` being `lit[0]` or infinity if `lit[0]` is infinity, `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `a`. This changes the state of `a` to include the new element. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
