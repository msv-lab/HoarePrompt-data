Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b`; `n` must be at least 1; `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`; `a` now contains its previous elements plus the element `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to list `a`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, the element appended to `a` is the last element of `b`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
