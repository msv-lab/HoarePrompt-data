Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is now equal to the last element of list `a`.
