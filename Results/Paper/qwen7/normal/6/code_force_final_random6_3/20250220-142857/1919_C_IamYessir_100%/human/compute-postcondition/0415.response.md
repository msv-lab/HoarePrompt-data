Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before, `b` is a list with at least one element, `cp` is 0, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
