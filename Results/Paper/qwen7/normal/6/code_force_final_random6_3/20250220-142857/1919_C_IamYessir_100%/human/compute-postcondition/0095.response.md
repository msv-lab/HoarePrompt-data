Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; `a` is now a list containing the element `lit[1]` (since `a.append(lit[i])` and `i` was 1 before the operation).**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` was 1, `lit[1]` is appended to `a`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation. `i` is incremented by 1 due to the nature of the operation, making it 2.
