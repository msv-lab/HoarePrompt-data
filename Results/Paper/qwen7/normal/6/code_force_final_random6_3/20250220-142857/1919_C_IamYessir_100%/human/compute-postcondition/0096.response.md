Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; `b` now contains the element from list `a` at index `i-1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing `b.append(a[i])`, `i` increments by 1 (as list indices start from 0), making `i` equal to 2. The value of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. List `b` now includes the element from list `a` at index `i-1`, which is index 1.
