Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of list `b`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`.
   - If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` and `y` are both infinity.
   - If `len(a)` is not 0 and `x > y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `b` has an additional element which is the same as `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`.
   - If `x == y`, `b` has an additional element `b[i]` appended to it; otherwise, `a` is updated by appending `b[i]` to it.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of list `b`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged unless they are updated inside the loop, but since no such update is mentioned, they stay the same.
   - `b` and `lit` are lists that may change based on the conditions inside the loop, but their state is not directly provided or modified outside the loop context.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` is equal to the length of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `len(b) + 1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` remains unchanged, and `b` and `lit` remain unchanged.**

However, to fit the required format:

State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` is unchanged, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged.**
