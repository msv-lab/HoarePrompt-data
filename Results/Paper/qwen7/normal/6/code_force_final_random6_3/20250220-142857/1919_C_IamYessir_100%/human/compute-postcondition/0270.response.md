Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` plus one, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` is set to infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`, and list `a` has its last element appended with the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the end of list `a`. This means that the length of list `a` increases by one, making `x`, which was previously equal to the last element of list `a`, now equal to the new last element of list `a`, which is `b[i]`. Since `i` was previously equal to the length of list `b`, after appending, `i` is now equal to the length of list `b` plus one. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
