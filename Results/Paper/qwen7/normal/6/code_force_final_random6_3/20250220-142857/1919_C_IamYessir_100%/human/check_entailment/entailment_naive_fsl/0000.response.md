Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Specifically, the logic used to decide which elements go into subsequence `a` and which go into subsequence `b` is flawed. Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
5
4 3 2 1 5
```

The program's output for this input would be `2`, but the optimal solution should be `1`.

To achieve the minimum penalty, we should aim to keep the elements in increasing order within each subsequence. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. For instance, in the given example, the program might incorrectly place `4` and `5` in different subsequences, leading to unnecessary penalties.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two subsequences such that the penalty is minimized. This can be achieved by maintaining two sorted lists and appending elements to the list that has the smaller last element, ensuring the penalty is minimized.
