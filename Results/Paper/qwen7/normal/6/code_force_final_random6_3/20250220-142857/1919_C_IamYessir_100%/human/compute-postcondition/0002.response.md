Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer input from the user, and `lit` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input from the user using `input()`. It then splits this input into a list of strings using `split()`, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is stored in `lit`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
