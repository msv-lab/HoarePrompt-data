Output State: **`n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `lit`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
