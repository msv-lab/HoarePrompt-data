Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If the last element of list `b` (which is `y`) is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of list `lit`, then `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` becomes the last element of list `b`, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`, then list `a` gains an additional element equal to `lit[i]`.
