Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` has the last element of the original `a` appended with `lit[3]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[3]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 3, `lit[3]` is appended to `a`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and the value of `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise, `x` remains infinity.
