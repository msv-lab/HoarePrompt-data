Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
