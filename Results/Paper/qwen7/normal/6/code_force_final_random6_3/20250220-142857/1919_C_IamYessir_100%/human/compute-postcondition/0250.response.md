Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` is greater than `y`, and the last element of list `b` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` remains unchanged as the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and list `a` gains a new element equal to `lit[i]`, provided that `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, the last element of list `a` is appended to list `a`, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b` if the length of list `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is appended to list `a`, and `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`. If appending `x` to list `a` and `lit[i]` being greater than `y` results in `y` being strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` not being greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` becoming the last element of list `b`, then `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to the last element of list `b`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` equals the last element of list `b`, `lit[i]` is set to the last element of list `b`, and the last element of list `b` is appended to list `b`.
