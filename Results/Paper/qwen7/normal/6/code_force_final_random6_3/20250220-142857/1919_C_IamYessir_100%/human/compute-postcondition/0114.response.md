Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `y` is infinity, if the list `a` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
