Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(0, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `n` is an input integer decremented by 1. This means `n` is one less than the original input integer.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(0, n)` will run from 0 to `n-1`).
   - `i` will take values from 0 up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, but this doesn't need adjustment as it starts at 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` starts at 0, but no adjustment is needed for this.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0**
