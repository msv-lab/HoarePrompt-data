Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before (specifically, `a` now contains `lit[i]`), `b` is a list with at least zero elements, `cp` is 0, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is now less than `lit[i]` since `lit[i] > y`.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been updated to include the element `lit[i]` by appending it to the existing list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
