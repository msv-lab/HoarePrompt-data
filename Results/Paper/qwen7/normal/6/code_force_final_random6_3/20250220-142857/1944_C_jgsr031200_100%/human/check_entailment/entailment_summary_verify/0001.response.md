### Reasoning

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The code simply counts the frequency of elements and prints the first element that appears either once or zero times. This does not reflect the actual game dynamics where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.

2. **Missing Game Logic**:
   - The code does not simulate the alternating turns of Alice and Bob. Alice picks the smallest available element, and Bob picks the largest available element. This logic is crucial for determining the optimal moves and the final MEX value.

3. **Incomplete Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not handle the game logic properly. It only counts frequencies and prints the first element that meets certain conditions, which is not sufficient for solving the problem.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game according to the rules:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice picks the smallest available element.
   - Bob picks the largest available element.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - After simulating the game, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_mex(c):
    mex = 0
    seen = set(c)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def optimal_game_score(n, arr):
    c = []
    a = sorted(set(arr))
    
    alice_turn = True
    for _ in range(n):
        if alice_turn:
            # Alice picks the smallest available element
            c.append(a.pop(0))
        else:
            # Bob picks the largest available element
            c.append(a.pop())
        alice_turn = not alice_turn
    
    return find_mex(c)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(optimal_game_score(n, arr))
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `c` is the array where Alice and Bob append their chosen elements.
   - `a` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements. Alice always picks the smallest available element, and Bob always picks the largest available element.
   - The `alice_turn` variable alternates between `True` and `False` to switch turns.

3. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After the game ends, the `find_mex` function calculates the MEX of the array `c`.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis and the corrected solution, the original assessment was inaccurate. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Final: False**
