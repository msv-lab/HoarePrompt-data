Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is set to the next element in `arr`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `freq[i]` is increased by 2.
   - `i` is the next element in `arr`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, it means the loop has just processed the current element in `arr`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next element in `arr`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The state of `freq[i]` is already updated and does not need to be adjusted for the next iteration.
   - `i` needs to be set to the next element in `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`freq[i]` is increased by 2, `i` is the next element in `arr`**
