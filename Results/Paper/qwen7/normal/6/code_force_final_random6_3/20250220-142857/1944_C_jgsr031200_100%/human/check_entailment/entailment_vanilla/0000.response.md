Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game between Alice and Bob.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice picks one element from `a` and appends it to `c`, then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks one element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of `c`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX.

### Code Analysis

The provided code seems to have some irrelevant functions commented out and an incomplete function `func_1`. Let's focus on the relevant part:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Frequency Array**:
   - `freq` is initialized to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

2. **Counting Single Occurrences**:
   - The loop counts how many elements appear exactly once (`cou`).

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - If there are at least two unique elements in `arr`, the MEX will be `2`.
   - If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be `1`.
   - If no unique elements exist, the MEX will be `0`.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The code does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the different strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - It simply counts the frequency of elements and prints the first element that appears either once or zero times.

2. **Missing Game Logic**:
   - The code does not implement the alternating turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It does not ensure that Alice maximizes and Bob minimizes the MEX.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice will pick the smallest available element that hasn't been picked before.
   - Bob will pick the largest available element that hasn't been picked before.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - After simulating the game, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_mex(c):
    mex = 0
    seen = set(c)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def optimal_game_score(n, arr):
    c = []
    a = sorted(set(arr))
    
    alice_turn = True
    for _ in range(n):
        if alice_turn:
            # Alice picks the smallest available element
            c.append(a.pop(0))
        else:
            # Bob picks the largest available element
            c.append(a.pop())
        alice_turn = not alice_turn
    
    return find_mex(c)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(optimal_game_score(n, arr))
```

### Conclusion

The provided code is **incorrect** because it does not simulate the game correctly and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
