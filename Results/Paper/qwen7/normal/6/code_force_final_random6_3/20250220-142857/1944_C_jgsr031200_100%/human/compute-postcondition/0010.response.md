State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `n + 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be greater than `i`, starting from `i = 0`.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than -1 (since `n + 1 > 0` implies `n > -1`).

The initial value of `cou` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.
