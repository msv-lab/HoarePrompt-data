### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to her array `c`, then deleting it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.
- Both players play optimally: Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - Iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency list.
   - Iterates through the frequency list to determine the smallest index that appears either once or zero times.
   - Prints the first such index and breaks the loop.

2. **Key Issues**:
   - The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves.
   - It only counts the frequency of elements in `arr` and prints the first index that appears either once or zero times.
   - This approach does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
- The function `func_1` indeed iterates through the frequency list to find the smallest index that meets the criteria (`freq[i] == 1` or `freq[i] == 0`).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program does not simulate the game logic correctly. It fails to handle the alternating turns and the strategic decisions made by Alice and Bob.
- The output of the program does not match the expected results for the given test cases.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore does not produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
