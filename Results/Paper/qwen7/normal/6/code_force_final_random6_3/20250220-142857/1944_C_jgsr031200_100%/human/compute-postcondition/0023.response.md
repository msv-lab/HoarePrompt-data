Output State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition `(cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0)` is satisfied.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or block of code. In this context, it means that the loop or block of code that was being executed has been exited. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `cou` and `i` remain unchanged from their last known states. The condition `(cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0)` is still satisfied because the `break` statement does not alter the truth value of this condition.
