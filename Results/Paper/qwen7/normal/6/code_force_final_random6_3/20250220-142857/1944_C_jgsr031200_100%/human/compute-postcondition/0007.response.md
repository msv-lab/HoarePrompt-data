Output State: The frequency list `freq` will contain the count of how many times each index from 0 to n (inclusive) appeared in the list `arr`. Specifically, if an index `i` appeared `k` times in `arr`, then `freq[i]` will be `k`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `freq[i]` will hold the total count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the original list `arr`.
