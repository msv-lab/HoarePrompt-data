Output State: **`freq[i]` is increased by 2, `i` is the next element in `arr`**

Explanation: The code `freq[i] += 1` increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Since `freq[i]` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by 2. The value of `i` remains the next element in `arr`.
