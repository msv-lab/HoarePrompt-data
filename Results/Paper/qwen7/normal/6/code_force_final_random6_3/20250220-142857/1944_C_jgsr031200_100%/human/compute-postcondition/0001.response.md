Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being iterated over the elements of the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the List `arr`**: The list `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\). This means each element in `arr` is an index into another list (not specified in the given context but implied).

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the elements of `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one valid element. Additionally, the variable `i` will take on the values from `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element and that `i` takes on the value of each element in `arr` during the loop iterations.

**State:**
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\).
- `freq` is a list of zeros with length \(n + 1\).
- `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`.

Since the loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty and that `i` is initialized to the first element in `arr`.

**Final State:**
State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), `freq` is a list of zeros with length \(n + 1\), and `i` is the first element in `arr`**.
