Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `n`, since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `t` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` as it was initially, and `n` retains its original input integer value.
