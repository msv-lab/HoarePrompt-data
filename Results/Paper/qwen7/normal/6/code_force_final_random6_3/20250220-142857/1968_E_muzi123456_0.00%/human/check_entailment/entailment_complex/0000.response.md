Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
3. The program then prints `n` lines, each containing '1' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. This part of the logic is intended to place cells in a specific pattern across the grid.
4. However, the problem statement requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). The current implementation does not ensure that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells are maximized.
5. The provided example outputs do not follow the pattern of the given solution. For instance, for \(n=3\), the expected output should include cells that achieve the maximum possible Manhattan distances, but the current program simply prints cells in a linear fashion along the first row.

Given these observations, the current implementation does not solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
