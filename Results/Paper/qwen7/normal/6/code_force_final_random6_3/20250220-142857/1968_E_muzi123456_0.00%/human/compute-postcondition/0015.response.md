Output: **' '**

Explanation: 
- The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
- `i` is explicitly set to 49.
- `n` is also explicitly set to 49.

The code snippet provided does not contain any loop or conditional statements that would modify the values of `i` or `n`. It simply prints a space character (`' '`).

Since there are no changes to `i` or `n` in the given code, and the print statement outputs a single space, the output will be a space character.
