Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop is defined as: `for i in range(1, n + 1):`
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration based on the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- The exact values of `i` and `n` are not provided, but we know that the loop has just finished an iteration. This means `i` was incremented from its value in the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
2. **Increment of `i`**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if the loop just finished, `i` was `n` in the previous iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop; it remains the same for all iterations. Thus, `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State
- `i` will be `n + 1` (since it was `n` in the previous iteration and is incremented by 1).
- `n` remains the same as it did in the previous iteration.

### Updated State
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**
