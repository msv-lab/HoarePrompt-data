Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, t and n, where t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but it processes these two values within its scope.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify what the function should return, we can only describe the parameters it works with and their constraints. If there are specific outputs or return values, they would need to be provided in the problem statement.
