State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n`).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.
4. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but should be preserved as it might be used elsewhere in the program.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `i` (which is set to 1 at the start of the loop).
