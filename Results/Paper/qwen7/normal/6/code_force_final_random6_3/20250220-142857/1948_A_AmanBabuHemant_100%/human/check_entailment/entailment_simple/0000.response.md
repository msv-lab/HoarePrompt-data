Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
3. It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (since a special character requires having exactly one neighbor different from itself, which cannot be achieved with an odd count).
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that every character in the string, except the first and last, has exactly one neighbor different from itself, making them special characters.
5. It then checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If so, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".
6. The program logic is sound and handles all specified constraints and examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
