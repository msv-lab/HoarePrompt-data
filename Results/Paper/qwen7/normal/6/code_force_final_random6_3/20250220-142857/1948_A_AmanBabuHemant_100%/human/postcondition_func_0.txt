The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even and the string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times is less than 200 characters, it prints 'YES' followed by the generated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.
