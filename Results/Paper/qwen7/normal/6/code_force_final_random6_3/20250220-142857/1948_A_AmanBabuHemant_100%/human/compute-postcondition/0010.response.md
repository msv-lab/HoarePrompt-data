Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

We need to determine what `s` will be when the print statement executes.

Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer representing half of `n`.

Given that `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, the string `s` will consist of 'AAB' concatenated with itself `n // 2` times.

For example, if `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2`, and `s` would be 'AAB' repeated 2 times, resulting in 'AABAAB'.

Since `n` is even and the length of `s` is less than 200, the maximum value for `n` would be 198 (since `n // 2` would then be 99, and 'AAB' repeated 99 times is 198 characters long).

Therefore, `s` will be 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, where `n // 2` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).

Output: **'AAB' repeated [n // 2] times (where n is an even integer and n // 2 is an integer between 1 and 99)**
