Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.** 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `len(s) < 200` is true or false, the value of `t` will always be decremented by 1, `n` remains an input integer, and `s` remains 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
