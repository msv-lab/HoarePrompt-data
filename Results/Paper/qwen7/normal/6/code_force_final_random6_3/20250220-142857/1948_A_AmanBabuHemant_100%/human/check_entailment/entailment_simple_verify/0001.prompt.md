You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, `n` will be an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `s` will be 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even and the resulting string length is less than 200. Otherwise, `s` will not be defined or will be 'NO' printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking Special Characters Requirement:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd. This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Generating a Suitable String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`.
     - This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making them special.
     - For example, if `n = 6`, the generated string would be `"AABAAB"`, which has 4 special characters (positions 2, 4, 5, and 6).

4. **String Length Check:**
   - The program checks if the length of the generated string `s` is less than 200.
     - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
     - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO". However, since we are generating strings of length `3 * (n // 2)`, and `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` will be `3 * 25 = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
- The program generates a suitable string with the required number of special characters when `n` is even.
- The generated string length is always within the allowed limit of 200.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
