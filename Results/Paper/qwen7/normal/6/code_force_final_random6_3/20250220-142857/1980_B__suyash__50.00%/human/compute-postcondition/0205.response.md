Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[i_end + 1]]`, `fav` is not equal to `l[i_end + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, and `fav` remain unchanged from their initial states.
