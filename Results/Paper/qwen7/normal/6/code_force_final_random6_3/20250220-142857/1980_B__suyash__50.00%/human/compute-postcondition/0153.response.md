Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(l)`, `a` is the input string, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is a part of `a` converted to an integer, `o` is updated to a list of strings split from the input string, `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`, `fav` is not defined unless `k` equals `n`, `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements of list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`, `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in reverse order, `t` is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to run for, `a` is updated to the input string, `b` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`. If `k` equals `n`, then `fav` is not defined unless `k` equals `n`.
