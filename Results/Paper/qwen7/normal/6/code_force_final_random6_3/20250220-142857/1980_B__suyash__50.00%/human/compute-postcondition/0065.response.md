Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `k` is defined as `k - dic[l[2]]`. Here, `l` is a list, and `l[2]` refers to the third element of the list `l`. However, the value of `dic` (a dictionary) and the list `l` are not provided in the initial state. Since the value of `k` depends on `dic[l[2]]`, and without knowing `dic` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('MAYBE')`.

Given that the print statement directly outputs the string `'MAYBE'` regardless of the values of `i`, `k`, `dic`, and `l`, the output will be:

Output: **MAYBE**
