Output State: **`i` is equal to `t`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `a` into parts using the `split()` method, which splits the string at whitespace by default. Then, `map(int, ...)` converts each part of the split string into an integer. The result is assigned to `b`, which is now a list of integers. The variables `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
