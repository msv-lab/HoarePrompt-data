Output State: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `n-2`. The function returns two values, `v` and `u`, which are then assigned to the variables `v` and `u` respectively. The variable `d` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`path` and `remaining_vertices`) also remain unchanged in terms of their conditions.
