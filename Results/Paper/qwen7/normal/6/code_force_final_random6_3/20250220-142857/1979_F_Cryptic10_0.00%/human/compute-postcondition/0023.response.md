Postcondition: `path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no changes occur.
