Postcondition: `d` is `n-1`, `v` is a vertex, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`. We either break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or we continue without any changes if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`.
