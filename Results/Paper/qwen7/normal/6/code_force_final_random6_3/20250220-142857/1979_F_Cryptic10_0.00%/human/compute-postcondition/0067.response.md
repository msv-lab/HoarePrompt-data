Postcondition: **`d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the value of `v` (if `v` does not equal 0), `remaining_vertices` has removed the vertex `v` from its list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no change occurs.**
