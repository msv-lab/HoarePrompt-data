Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices exist, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the graph to get information about the degrees of vertices and their connections.
   - The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path using at most \( n \) queries.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function sends a query to the graph and returns the vertex \( v \) with the minimum degree at least \( d \) and the non-connected vertex \( u \).
   - It handles the case where no such vertex \( v \) exists by returning \( (0, 0) \).

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to construct a Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes a list `path` to store the path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices.
   - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n - 1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it queries the graph using `func_1`.
     - If \( v \) is found (i.e., \( v \neq 0 \)), it checks if \( v \) is still in the set of remaining vertices.
     - If \( v \) is in the set, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from the set of remaining vertices.
     - The loop breaks once a valid vertex \( v \) is found and added to the path.

4. **Verification:**
   - The function correctly uses the queries to build a path.
   - It ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once by removing it from the set of remaining vertices after adding it to the path.
   - The function constructs the path in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.

### Correctness Check:

- **Query Handling:** The function correctly handles the queries and updates the remaining vertices set.
- **Path Construction:** The function ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and that the path is constructed using the allowed queries.
- **Hamiltonian Path:** Given that the graph is a complete graph minus \( n - 2 \) edges, and the problem guarantees the existence of a Hamiltonian path, the function should be able to find such a path within \( n \) queries.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the allowed queries.

**Correctness: **True**
