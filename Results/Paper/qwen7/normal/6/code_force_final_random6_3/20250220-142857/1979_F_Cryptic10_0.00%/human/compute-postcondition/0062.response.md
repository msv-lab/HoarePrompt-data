Output State: **`d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)` and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the only impact is that the current iteration is skipped. The values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.
