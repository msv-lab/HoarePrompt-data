Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `d` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - If `v` is 0, we continue the loop.
   - If `v` is not 0 and it is not in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, we do not change the state of `v` and `u`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse order, the next value of `d` would be `d + 1` (if `d` was previously `n-1`, then the next `d` would be `n-2`, and so on).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

5. **Consider the conditions**:
   - If `v` is 0, the loop continues, so `v` and `u` remain the same.
   - If `v` is not 0 and it is not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop breaks, so we do not need to adjust `v` and `u`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `d` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `v` and `u` remain the same if `v` is 0 or if `v` is not 0 but is in `remaining_vertices`.

Since the exact values of `v` and `u` are not specified, we can represent them as placeholders.

**Final State:**
State: **`v` is the return value of `func_1(d+1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d+1)`, `n` must be the same as before, and `d` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
