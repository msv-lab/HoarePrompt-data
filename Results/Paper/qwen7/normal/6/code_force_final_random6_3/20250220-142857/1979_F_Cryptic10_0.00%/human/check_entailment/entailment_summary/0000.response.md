Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph. The provided function `func_2` attempts to achieve this by querying the degree of vertices and their connections.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly queries the degree of a vertex and returns the vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria and the non-connected vertex. This is essential for identifying the next vertex to add to the Hamiltonian path.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to iteratively build a Hamiltonian path. It starts with the highest degree and works its way down, ensuring that the selected vertex is not already part of the path. The logic seems sound and should work as intended for finding a Hamiltonian path.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the function `func_2` appears to correctly implement the strategy for finding a Hamiltonian path using the provided queries. Each step of the process is logically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
