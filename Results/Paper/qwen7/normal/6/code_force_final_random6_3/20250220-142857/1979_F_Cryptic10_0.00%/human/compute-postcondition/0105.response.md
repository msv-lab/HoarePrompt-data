Output State: The final state of the loop will be such that `path` contains all vertices from 1 to n, added in descending order from the highest index `d` down to 0. The `remaining_vertices` set will be empty since every vertex that was present initially has been removed from it and added to `path`. The value of `d` will be -1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` and decrements `d` in each iteration until it reaches -1.
