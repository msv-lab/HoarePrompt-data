Output State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`, and the value of `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the `remaining_vertices` might have been modified or checked. The values of `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not alter their values.
