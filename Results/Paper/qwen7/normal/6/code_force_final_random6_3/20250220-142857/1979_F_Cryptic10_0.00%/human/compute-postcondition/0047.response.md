Output State: **`v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement causes the loop or conditional block it is within to terminate, so the state of `v` being no longer in `remaining_vertices` and `v` being included in `path` remains unchanged. The value of `u` is also unaffected by the `break` statement. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged conditions along with the fact that the loop or conditional block has been broken out of.
