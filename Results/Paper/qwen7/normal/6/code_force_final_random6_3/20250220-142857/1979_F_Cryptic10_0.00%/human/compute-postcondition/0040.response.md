Output State: **`v` is 0, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `v` and `u`, their values remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
