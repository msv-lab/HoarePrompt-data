Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`.
   - The variable `d` is being iterated over.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `d`:**
   - The loop starts with `d` taking the value of `n - 1` and decrements until `d` reaches `-1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `d` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Identify the States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we need to ensure that `d` is initialized correctly and meets the condition for the loop to start executing.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `d` is initialized to `n - 1` and the loop continues as long as `d` is greater than or equal to `-1`, we need to ensure that `d` is set to `n - 1` initially.

Given the initial state:
- `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations.
- `remaining_vertices` is empty.
- `d` is `-1`.

To ensure the loop starts executing, `d` should be set to `n - 1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` is empty, and `d` is `n - 1`**
