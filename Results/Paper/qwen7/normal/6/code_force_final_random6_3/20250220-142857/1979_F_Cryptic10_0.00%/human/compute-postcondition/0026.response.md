Output State: **`v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` remains unchanged, `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the return values of `func_1(d)` to `v` and `u`. Since `d` is defined as `v - 3`, the value of `v` becomes `d - 3`. The function `func_1(d)` is called with `d` as an argument, and its return values are assigned to `v` and `u`. The variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
