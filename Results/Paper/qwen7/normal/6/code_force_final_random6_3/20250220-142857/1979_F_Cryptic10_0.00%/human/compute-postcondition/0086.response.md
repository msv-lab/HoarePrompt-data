Output State: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions without any modifications.
