Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `d` is `n-1`
- `v` is a vertex
- `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`
- `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`
- The loop either breaks out of the most internal loop or an if statement.

### Loop Head:
```
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `d` is initialized to `n-1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `n-1`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be decremented from `n-1` to `n-2`.
- Since `d` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `d` will be `n-2`.

### Adjusted States:
- `d` will be `n-2`.
- `v` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- `path` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- `remaining_vertices` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`.**
