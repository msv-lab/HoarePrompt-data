Output State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `n-2`. The function returns two values, `v` and `u`, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we assume that `v` is one of the values returned and `d` is updated to `v - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
