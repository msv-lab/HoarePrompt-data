Output State: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and the vertex `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`.**

This means that the `remaining_vertices` set no longer includes the vertex `v`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
