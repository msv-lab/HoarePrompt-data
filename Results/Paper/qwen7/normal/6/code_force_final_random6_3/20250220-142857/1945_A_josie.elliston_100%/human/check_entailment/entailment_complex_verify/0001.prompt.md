You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

from math import ceil

test_case_n = int(input())
for _ in range(test_case_n):
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, and (extroverts % 3 + universals) is greater than or equal to 3
    #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`, then `universals` is adjusted such that `(extroverts % 3 + universals) == 3`.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, where extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals, and if extroverts is not divisible by 3 and (extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3, then universals is adjusted such that (extroverts % 3 + universals) == 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is at least 3, it adjusts `universals` so that `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` equals 3. The function then returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3. If the initial condition is not met, the function returns `None`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers such that 0 <= introverts, extroverts, universals <= 10^9.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns introverts plus ret if ret is not None, otherwise it returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It calls another function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. Depending on the result, it either returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1`, or returns `-1` if `func_1` returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can be placed in any configuration.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we check if adding the universals can make it divisible by 3.
   - If the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 plus the number of universals is less than 3, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3, and thus the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of `(extroverts + universals)` by 3.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3, and thus it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents.

4. **Checking Edge Cases:**
   - For the input `(1, 4, 1)`, `func_1(4, 1)` should return `2` because 4 extroverts can share 2 tents (2 extroverts per tent), and 1 universal can share another tent with the remaining 2 extroverts. However, the function returns `-1` because it doesn't handle this case correctly.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 1)`, `func_1(1, 1)` should return `1` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal can share a tent, but the function returns `-1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 but can still be grouped with universals.
   - The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` and thus inherits its issues.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
