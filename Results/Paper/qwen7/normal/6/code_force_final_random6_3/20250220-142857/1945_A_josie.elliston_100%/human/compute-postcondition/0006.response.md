Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is greater than or equal to 3, `universals` is adjusted so that `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` equals 3. The function returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3. If no conditions are met, the function returns `None`.**
