Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as inputs.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`. If this condition is true, it adjusts `universals` to ensure `(extroverts % 3 + universals) == 3` and returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
   - If the condition is false, it returns `None`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as inputs.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and stores the result in `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns `introverts + ret`.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that extroverts are grouped into tents of 3 people, adjusting `universals` if necessary.
   - The logic in `func_2` calculates the total number of tents required by adding the tents needed for extroverts and universals to the number of tents needed for introverts (each introvert gets their own tent).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where it's impossible to accommodate extroverts due to insufficient universals, returning `-1`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no participants, returning `0`.

5. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The annotated program matches the logic described in the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
