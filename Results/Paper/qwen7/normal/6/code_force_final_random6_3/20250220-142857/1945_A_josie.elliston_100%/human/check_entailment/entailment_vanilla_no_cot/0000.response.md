Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not fully account for the constraints and requirements of the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to calculate the number of tents required for extroverts and universals but does not properly handle the scenario where there are leftover extroverts who cannot find a suitable tent. Specifically, the condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0` and the subsequent check `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is insufficient to ensure that all extroverts can be accommodated.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals and then adds the number of introverts' tents. However, it does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is such that even with all universals, they still cannot form complete groups of three. For example, if there are 4 extroverts and no universals, it should return -1 because it's impossible to place them in tents following the rules.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # Calculate the number of full tents for extroverts and universals
    full_tents = extroverts // 3
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    # Check if the remaining extroverts can be placed with universals
    if remaining_extroverts == 1:
        if universals >= 1:
            universals -= 1
            remaining_extroverts += 3
        else:
            return None
    elif remaining_extroverts == 2:
        if universals >= 2:
            universals -= 2
            remaining_extroverts += 3
        else:
            return None
    # Calculate the number of additional tents needed for the remaining extroverts
    additional_tents = ceil(remaining_extroverts / 3)
    # Total tents needed for extroverts and universals
    total_tents = full_tents + additional_tents
    return total_tents

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    tents_for_extroverts_and_universals = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    if tents_for_extroverts_and_universals is None:
        return -1
    # Add the tents needed for introverts
    return introverts + tents_for_extroverts_and_universals
```

This corrected version ensures that all extroverts can be accommodated and handles the edge cases properly.
