Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is a boolean variable, but its specific value (True or False) is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is an integer, and it is defined as `i+1`. This means `i` is one more than some unspecified integer.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is defined as `i+1`, and since `i` itself is an integer, the value of `i` must be an integer greater than 0 (because `i+1` is greater than 0).

Therefore, the print statement will output an integer greater than 0.

Output: **an integer greater than 0**
