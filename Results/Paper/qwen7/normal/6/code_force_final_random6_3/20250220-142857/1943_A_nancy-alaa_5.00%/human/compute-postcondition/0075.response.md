Output State: **Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no further assignment or operation after the `break`, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The postcondition remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
