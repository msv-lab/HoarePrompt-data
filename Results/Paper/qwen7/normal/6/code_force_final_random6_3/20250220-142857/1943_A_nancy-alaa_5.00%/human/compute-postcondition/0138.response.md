Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `first` is still either True or False depending on whether the condition `mpp[i] == 1` was met during any iteration, and `arr` and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the value of `n`. The loop did not encounter a break condition that would terminate it early, so it iterated over all indices from 0 to `n-1`. During these iterations, the conditions inside the loop were checked, but since the loop ran through all elements, no specific internal state changes (like setting `first` to True) would have prevented it from completing all iterations. Therefore, the values of `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain as they were initially.
