Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1` as per the initial state, and `n` remains an integer equal to the input integer since no operation changes its value.
