Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `first`, `i`, and `n`.
