Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is False, the program continues without breaking.
