Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are the input value from `int(input())` and the loop counter (which is `_` in this case but doesn't affect the state directly).

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `first` is a boolean.
   - `i` is an integer equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the input value from `int(input())` is a positive integer. The loop counter `_` is incremented with each iteration, but it does not affect the state directly.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if the input value from `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the start of each iteration, and `n` is greater than 0, the loop will continue as long as the input is a positive integer.

5. **Update the state**:
   - The state of `first` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - The state of `i` remains unchanged because it is always set to `n` at the start of each iteration.
   - The state of `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0**. 

However, since the loop continues based on the input, we need to ensure that the input value from `int(input())` is a positive integer for the loop to continue. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input must be a positive integer.

**Final State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and the input must be a positive integer**.
