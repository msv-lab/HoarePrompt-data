Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range is still valid.
