Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables `first`, `i`, `n`, or `mpp`. The conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
