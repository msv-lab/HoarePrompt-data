Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `first`, `i`, or `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
