Output State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Since the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n-1` and then stops, `i` will be set to `n` right after the loop ends. The value of `first` remains unchanged unless it was set to `True` inside the loop, but since the problem does not specify any conditions under which `first` would be set to `True` that would cause the loop to break early, we assume `first` retains its initial value of `False`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
