You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list a contains n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `first` is still either True or False depending on whether the condition `mpp[i] == 1` was met during any iteration, and `arr` and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX):**
   - The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`.
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` to check if they are present in the `mpp` dictionary (which is a counter of the original array `arr`).
   - If a number `i` is not in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `first` is already `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to find the MEX by iterating through numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checking their presence in the counter.
   - However, the logic for setting `first` to `True` and the subsequent condition checks are unnecessary and do not correctly simulate the game rules.
   - The program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the final array `c` is constructed according to the game rules.

2. **Game Rules Not Followed:**
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The program does not simulate these turns or construct the array `c` accordingly.

3. **Output Does Not Match the Expected Behavior:**
   - The output of the program does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players to achieve the final MEX value.
   - The program does not handle the game's alternating turns and the specific rules for Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the program's logic and its failure to correctly simulate the game rules, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
