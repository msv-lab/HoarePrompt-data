Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `first = False` changes the value of the variable `first` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
