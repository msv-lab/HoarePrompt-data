Output State: **Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. The values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial postcondition.
