Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i] != 1` or `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` and `first` is True, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific action is taken regarding `first`, `i`, or `n`.
