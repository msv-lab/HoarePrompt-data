Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is either 1 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`, `n` must be greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `first`, `i`, and `n`. It only indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
