Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(n)`. This means `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` is a boolean.
   - `i` is an integer and it is incremented by 1 from the previous value.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - `first` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `first` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` + 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `first` remains unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0**.
