Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` function:

1. `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]`: This slice operation extracts the first `k` characters from the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
2. The result of this slice operation is then repeated `n` times using the multiplication operator (`*`).

The output will be the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` sliced from the start up to the `k`-th character, repeated `n` times.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n**
