Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
- It then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.
- This approach ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the generated string.
- The string generated is the lexicographically smallest possible string because it simply repeats the smallest `k` characters, ensuring the smallest length and maintaining the order.

Given the problem constraints and the solution provided, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
