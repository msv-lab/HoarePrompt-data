Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `i` is now 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
