Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `i` is now equal to `t`, which means `i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `i` ≤ 675. For each iteration, `n` and `k` were assigned values from the input split and converted to integers. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will have the values from the last input provided during the loop execution. The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.
