Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers obtained from an input source (e.g., user input).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a string containing all lowercase English letters.
   - `[:k]` slices this string from the beginning up to the character at index `k-1` (since slicing is zero-indexed).
   - `* n` repeats the sliced string `n` times.

Given these details, the output will depend on the values of `k` and `n`, but since these values are inputs, we need to express the output in terms of these inputs.

**Output**: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] repeated n times** (where `k` is the input integer used to slice the string and `n` is the input integer used to repeat the sliced string).
