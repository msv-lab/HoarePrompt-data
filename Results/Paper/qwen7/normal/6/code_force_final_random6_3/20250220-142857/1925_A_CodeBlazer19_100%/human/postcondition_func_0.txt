The function processes up to 676 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 26 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 26 \). It then prints a string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the alphabet, repeated \( n \) times. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
