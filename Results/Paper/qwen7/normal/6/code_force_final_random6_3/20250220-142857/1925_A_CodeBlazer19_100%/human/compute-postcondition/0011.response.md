Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are input integers assigned from the input split and converted to integers.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

Let's break down the components:
1. `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a string containing all lowercase English alphabets.
2. `[:k]` slices this string from the beginning up to the character at index `k-1` (since slicing is zero-indexed).
3. `* n` repeats the sliced string `n` times.

The output will be the sliced string repeated `n` times. Since `n` and `k` are input integers, their specific values determine the exact output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where k and n are input integers)**
