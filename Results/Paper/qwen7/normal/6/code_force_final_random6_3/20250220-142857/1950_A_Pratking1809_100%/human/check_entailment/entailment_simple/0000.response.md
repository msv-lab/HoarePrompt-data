Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - `if a < b < c:` checks for a stair.
   - `elif a < b > c:` checks for a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
4. The logic inside the loop is correct and processes each test case independently.
5. The program does not have any logical errors based on the provided example and the problem description.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
