Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.
