### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE".

Given the problem description and the example inputs, the program appears to be handling all the conditions correctly. It checks the stair condition (`a < b < c`) and the peak condition (`a < b > c`) properly and handles the default case where the digits do not form either a stair or a peak.

### Correctness:

- The logic for checking the conditions is accurate.
- The program handles all possible cases as specified in the problem statement.
- The output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
