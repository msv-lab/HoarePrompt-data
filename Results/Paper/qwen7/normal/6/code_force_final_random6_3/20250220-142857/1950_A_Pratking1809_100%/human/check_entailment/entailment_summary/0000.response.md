Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither.
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case, reading three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
- It checks the conditions for a stair (\(a < b < c\)) and a peak (\(a < b > c\)) using the appropriate logical operators.
- If the digits satisfy the conditions for a stair, it prints 'STAIR'. If they satisfy the conditions for a peak, it prints 'PEAK'. Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'.
- The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
