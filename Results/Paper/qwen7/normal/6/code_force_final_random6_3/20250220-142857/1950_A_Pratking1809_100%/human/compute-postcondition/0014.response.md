Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `c` is the third integer entered, and either the condition `a < b > c` is false (which is already given in the precondition), or the condition `a ≥ b` or `b ≤ c` is true.
