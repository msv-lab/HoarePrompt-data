You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the last input provided during the loop's execution, and the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after the loop finishes.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` will still be between 1 and 1000, `q` will still be at least 1, `i` will be set to 3 (indicating the loop has run three times), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the values from the last set of inputs provided. The loop has processed all inputs up to the third iteration, but since no further inputs are expected, the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and c within the constraints 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, and an integer t within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. It does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
