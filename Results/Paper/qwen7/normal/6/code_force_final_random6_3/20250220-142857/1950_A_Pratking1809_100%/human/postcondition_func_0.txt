The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9, and an integer \(t\) within the range 1 to 1000. For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
