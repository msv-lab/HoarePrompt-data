Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array to find the position where `find` should be inserted to maintain the order.
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly:
     - Initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`.
     - Use a loop to perform binary search until `l` is greater than `r`.
     - Calculate the middle index `mid` and adjust `l` or `r` based on the comparison with `find`.
   - After the binary search, it checks if the element at `l` is equal to `find`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If the element at `l` is already `find`, it prints `0`.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` only prints `1` and returns the indices if the element at `l` is not equal to `find`. This means it assumes the array needs to be rearranged to place `find` at `l`.
   - However, the problem statement requires exactly 2 swaps to be performed in some cases, which is not handled by the current implementation.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the requirements, but the logic inside `func_1` might not always produce the correct solution as per the problem constraints.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps:**
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where `l` is not equal to the index of `find`. It does not handle the scenario where more than one swap is needed.
   - According to the problem, 2 operations are always sufficient, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

2. **Missing Cases:**
   - The function does not handle cases where the element at `l` is `find` but the array still needs to be rearranged using 2 swaps.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle all scenarios required by the problem statement. Specifically, it does not ensure that the array can be rearranged using exactly 2 swaps in all cases.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
