Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds the target value `x` at position `l`.

2. The provided code does not actually implement the necessary logic to achieve the required rearrangement. Instead, it performs a binary search directly on the given permutation without any swaps.

3. The binary search logic in the provided code is incorrect because:
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` should be set to 1 and `n`, respectively, not 0 and `n-1`.
   - The loop condition should check `r - l > 1` instead of `l <= r`.
   - The `index` method is used incorrectly to find the position of `find` in the array, which is unnecessary and incorrect since we need to ensure the correct position for `l` after swaps.

4. The provided code does not handle the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps correctly. It simply prints 1 or 0 based on whether `l` is equal to the index of `find`, which does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` at position `l`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
