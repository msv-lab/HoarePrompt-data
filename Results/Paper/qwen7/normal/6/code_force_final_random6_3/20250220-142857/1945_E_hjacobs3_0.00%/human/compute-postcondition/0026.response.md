Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` incremented by 1.**

This means the program will return a list with two elements. The first element is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second element is the index of `find` in the list `array` (converted to a string and incremented by 1).
