Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required solution. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps. The binary search implementation is also incorrect because it does not properly handle the condition where the target `x` is not initially present in the array.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search logic is flawed. The variable `r` should be initialized to `n`, not `n-1`. Also, the logic inside the loop needs to be adjusted to correctly narrow down the search range.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_1` only performs one swap if the target `x` is not at the position `l`. However, the problem statement guarantees that two operations are always sufficient, which means the function might not be correctly handling all cases where two swaps are needed.

To fix the program, you need to ensure that the binary search logic is correct and that the necessary swaps are performed to place `x` at the correct position. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 1, n  # Initialize r to n instead of n-1
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] < find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return []  # No swap needed
    else:
        # Find the index of the target value
        idx = array.index(find) + 1
        # Perform the necessary swaps
        if l == 1:
            # Swap with the last element
            array[idx - 1], array[n - 1] = array[n - 1], array[idx - 1]
            array[idx - 1], array[l] = array[l], array[idx - 1]
            return [str(idx), str(n)]
        elif l == n:
            # Swap with the first element
            array[idx - 1], array[0] = array[0], array[idx - 1]
            array[idx - 1], array[l - 1] = array[l - 1], array[idx - 1]
            return [str(idx), str(1)]
        else:
            # Swap with the first and last elements
            array[idx - 1], array[0] = array[0], array[idx - 1]
            array[idx - 1], array[l - 1] = array[l - 1], array[idx - 1]
            return [str(idx), str(1), str(n)]

```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search logic is correct and that the necessary swaps are performed to place `x` at the correct position.
