Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or `mid + 1`, `r` is `mid - 1`, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `r = mid - 1` updates the value of `r` to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still `(l + r) // 2`, but since `r` has been updated, this expression will reflect the new value of `r` when needed.
