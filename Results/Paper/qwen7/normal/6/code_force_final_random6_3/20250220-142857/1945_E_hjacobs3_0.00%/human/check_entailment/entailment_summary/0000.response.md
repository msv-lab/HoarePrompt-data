Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. It should start with `l = 1` and `r = n`, not `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`. This misalignment affects the calculation of the middle index `mid`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not actually perform any swaps to rearrange the array before performing the binary search. Instead, it directly performs the binary search and checks if the `find` value is at the correct position. If not, it incorrectly prints `1` and returns the indices of `l` and the index of `find` without making any necessary swaps.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the indices of `l` and the index of `find` when `find` is not found, which is not aligned with the problem requirements. The problem requires printing the indices of the elements to be swapped, not just their positions.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
