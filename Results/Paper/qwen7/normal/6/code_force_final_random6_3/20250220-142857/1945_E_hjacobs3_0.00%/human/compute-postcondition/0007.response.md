Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is `mid` + 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2, and `array[mid] < find`**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `r`, `mid`, and the condition `array[mid] < find` remain unchanged.
