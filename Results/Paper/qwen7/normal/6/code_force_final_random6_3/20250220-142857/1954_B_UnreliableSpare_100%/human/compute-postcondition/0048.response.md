Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `False`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `0`.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` after updating it with `min(ans, cnt)`.
- `cnt` is `0`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `cnt` is `0`, and there is no information about `arr` or `val` that would change `ans` from its initial value of `0`. Therefore, `ans` remains `0`.

Output: **0**
