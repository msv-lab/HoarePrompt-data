Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be considered for adjustment.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will start executing if `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is already stated to be greater than 1, this condition is satisfied.
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` is already greater than 1, no change is needed for `n`.
   - The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, which is correct for the first iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are the ones related to `i` and `n`:

State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`**.

Since the other variables (`ans`, `val`, `cnt`, etc.) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
