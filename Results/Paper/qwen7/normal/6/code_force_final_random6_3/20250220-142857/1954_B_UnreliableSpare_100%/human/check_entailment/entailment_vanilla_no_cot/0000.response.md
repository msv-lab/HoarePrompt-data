Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is called without proper handling of test cases**: The function `func_1` is defined but never actually called within the main loop that processes each test case. Instead, there should be a loop to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Incorrect logic for checking if the array is beautiful**: The current logic checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), which is not sufficient. It needs to check if the array can be made beautiful by the specified operation.

3. **Incorrect logic for calculating the minimum removals**: The current logic assumes the array is already uniform and tries to find the minimum number of consecutive equal elements. This does not account for the specific operation required to make the array non-beautiful.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already uniform
        if len(set(arr)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of removals needed
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if arr[i-1] == arr[i+1]:
                left_count = arr.count(arr[i-1])
                right_count = arr.count(arr[i+1])
                total_count = left_count + right_count - 1
                min_removals = min(min_removals, n - total_count)
        
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.
