Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if the array is monotonically the same (i.e., all elements are identical).
3. If the array is not monotonically the same, the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements in the array.
4. The logic for determining the minimum number of consecutive identical elements is correct. It iterates through the array and counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements, which indirectly gives the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
5. The program handles the special case where the array is monotonically the same by printing `-1`.
6. The program uses `Decimal` from the `decimal` module, but it is not used in the main logic, which is fine since it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and produces the correct output based on the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
