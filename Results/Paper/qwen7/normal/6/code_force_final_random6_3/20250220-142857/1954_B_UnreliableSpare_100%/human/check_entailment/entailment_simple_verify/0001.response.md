### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array to count the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
   - The minimum number of removals required is the length of the longest sequence minus one, as removing all but one element in this sequence would make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
   - However, there are some edge cases that need to be considered:
     - The code does not handle the case where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements.
     - The code does not ensure that the array is indeed beautiful before processing it.
     - The code does not handle the case where the array has a single element, which is trivially beautiful.

4. **Functionality Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` is called within the main loop for each test case, which is appropriate.
   - The use of `Decimal` from the `decimal` module is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality.
   - The logic for counting the longest sequence of identical elements is sound and correctly calculates the minimum number of removals needed.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly identifies whether the array is uniform and handles this case appropriately.
   - However, the code does not verify that the array is beautiful before processing it. This is a critical oversight because the problem states that the array is beautiful, but the code does not explicitly check this condition.
   - The code assumes that the array is beautiful and proceeds with the calculation, which may lead to incorrect results if the array is not actually beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The given program is **incorrect** because it does not verify that the array is beautiful before processing it. While the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is correct, the program fails to ensure that the input array meets the necessary conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
