Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `flag` is `False`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n`.

5. **Check the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`. Since `i` is now `n`, the condition `i < n` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `flag` remains `False`.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `i` is now `n`.
   - `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged because the loop has not executed yet in this iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`**.
