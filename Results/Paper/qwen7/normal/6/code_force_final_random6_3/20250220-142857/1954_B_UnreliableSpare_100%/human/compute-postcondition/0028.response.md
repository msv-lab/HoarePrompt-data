Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables retain their initial conditions. Specifically, `flag` remains `False`, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still equal to `n-1`, `arr[i]` is still not equal to `val`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, which is now `0`.
