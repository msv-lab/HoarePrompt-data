Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `arr`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
