Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. However, since `cnt` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
