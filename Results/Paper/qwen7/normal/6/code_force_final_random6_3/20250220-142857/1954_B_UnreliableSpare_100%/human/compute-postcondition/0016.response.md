Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `flag`, `t`, `n`, and `i`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
