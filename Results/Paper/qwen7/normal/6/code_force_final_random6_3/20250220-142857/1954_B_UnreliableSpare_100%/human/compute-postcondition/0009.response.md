Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `flag` is False
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same (must still be greater than 1).

5. **Final State**:
   - `flag` remains False.
   - `t` remains the same (an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)).
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `i` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
