### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - It initializes a boolean flag `flag` to check if the array is already beautiful.
   - It iterates through the array to check if any two consecutive elements are different. If a difference is found, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If `flag` is `True` after the loop, it means the array is already beautiful, and the function prints `-1`.
   - If `flag` is `False`, it proceeds to calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `val` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array again to count consecutive occurrences of `val` and updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Handling Alternating Sequences**:
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is already beautiful by checking for any differences between consecutive elements.
   - When `flag` is `False`, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove seems correct. It counts consecutive occurrences of the first element and updates `ans` with the minimum count.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies that the array is not beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - It finds that removing the second element (`2`) results in the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.
   - The program outputs `1`, which is the correct answer.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already beautiful (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If the array has alternating elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`), the program correctly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies when the array is already beautiful and when it needs to remove elements to make it non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly handles the case where the array has alternating elements and other edge cases.
