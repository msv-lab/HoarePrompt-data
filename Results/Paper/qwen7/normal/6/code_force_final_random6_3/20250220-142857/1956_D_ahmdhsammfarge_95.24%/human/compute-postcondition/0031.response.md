Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the variable `j` and the range function, which includes `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range, i.e., `i + 1 <= j < len(lst)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 2 or more
   - `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`
   - `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 1 and `l` is 2 or more. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, no changes are made to `r` and `l`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1, the only variable that can change is `j`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` was 2 or more, the smallest possible value for `j` in the next iteration would be 3).

5. **New State:**
   - `i` remains 1
   - `j` becomes 3 (the smallest possible value for the next iteration)
   - `len(lst)` remains the same
   - `sm` and `over_sum` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `j`
   - `r` and `l` remain unchanged unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we assume `sm` is not greater than `over_sum` (or the condition hasn't been met yet).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`, `r` and `l` remain unchanged**.
