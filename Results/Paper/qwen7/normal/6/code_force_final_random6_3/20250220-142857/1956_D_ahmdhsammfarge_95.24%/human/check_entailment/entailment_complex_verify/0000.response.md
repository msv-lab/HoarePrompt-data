### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to find the best subarray to update, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented.
- The logic inside the function involves calculating a sum that includes elements before and after the subarray and a quadratic term based on the length of the subarray.
- Specifically, the function calculates `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not related to finding the MEX of the subarray.
- The function returns `r` and `l` hardcoded to 2 and 5, respectively, which means it doesn't actually depend on the input list `lst`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is supposed to generate a sequence of operations.
- However, the function simply appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list multiple times without any actual logic to determine the correct subarray to update.
- The function does not use the parameters `r` and `l` in a meaningful way to generate the operations.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function is supposed to update the subarray from `r` to `l` with the MEX value of that subarray.
- However, the function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
- The function appends operations to the `ops` list and then sets the sublist from `r` to `l` to a constant value `n`, which is `l - r + 1`.
- This is not equivalent to setting the sublist to the MEX value of the subarray.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program starts by calling `func_1` to get `r` and `l`, which are hardcoded to 2 and 5.
- It then enters a loop where it repeatedly calls `func_3` with these hardcoded values, updating the list `lst`.
- After the loop, it tries to replace zeros with ones, appending operations to the `ops` list.
- Finally, it prints the sum of the list and the length of the `ops` list.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not find the MEX of the subarray and set the subarray to this value. Instead, it uses hardcoded values and performs operations that do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the required logic of finding the MEX of the subarray and setting the subarray to this value.
