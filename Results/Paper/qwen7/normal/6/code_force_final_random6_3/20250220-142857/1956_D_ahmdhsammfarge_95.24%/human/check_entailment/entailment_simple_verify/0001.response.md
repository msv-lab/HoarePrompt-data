### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided code. Let's break down the problems and verify the original assessment:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function is supposed to find the optimal `l` and `r` to maximize the sum of the array by considering all possible subarrays.
   - However, the logic is flawed. Specifically, the sum calculation is incorrect. The current implementation sums the prefix and suffix of the array separately and adds the square of the subarray length, which does not correspond to the actual MEX value calculation required.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function might incorrectly choose indices without considering the MEX value properly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is intended to recursively generate operations, but it is not used in the main logic to solve the problem.
   - The function does not contribute to solving the problem and is redundant.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function is supposed to apply the operations and update the array.
   - It calls `func_2` to generate operations, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The function attempts to set the subarray to the MEX value but does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. For instance, it sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX value.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray.
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation:** The sum calculations in `func_1` are incorrect.
- **Redundant Operations:** `func_2` and `func_3` are not used correctly and add unnecessary complexity.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these flaws.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues with MEX calculation, sum calculation, and redundant operations.
