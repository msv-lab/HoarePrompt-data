Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 5, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1), `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is defined as `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` now holds the same value. All other variables remain unchanged.
