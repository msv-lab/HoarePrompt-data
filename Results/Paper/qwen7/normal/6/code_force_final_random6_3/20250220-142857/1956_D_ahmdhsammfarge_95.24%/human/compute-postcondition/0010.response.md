Output State: **The program returns a list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`.
- `r` is `r + 1`.
- `l` is `l + 1`.
- `n` is `l - r + 1`.
- The sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, the sublist from `r` to `l` is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each being `n`. Therefore, the final state of `lst` is as described.
