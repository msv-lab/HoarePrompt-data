Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function aims to find the optimal `l` and `r` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates the new sum if the subarray is modified.
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed because it incorrectly calculates the sum of the subarray and does not correctly implement the MEX calculation.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is supposed to recursively generate operations.
   - It seems to be intended to build a sequence of operations but is not used in the main logic to solve the problem.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function is intended to apply the operations and update the array.
   - It calls `func_2` to generate operations, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The function also attempts to set the subarray to the MEX value but does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray.
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation:** The sum calculations in `func_1` are incorrect.
- **Redundant Operations:** `func_2` and `func_3` are not used correctly and add unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
