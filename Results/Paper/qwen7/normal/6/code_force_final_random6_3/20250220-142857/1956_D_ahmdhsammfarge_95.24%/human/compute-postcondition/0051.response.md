Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is greater than 3
   - `r` is 2
   - `l` is 3
   - `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`
   - `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(lst)`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` remains constant at 2 since it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - Since `j` must be greater than 3 initially and it will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - All other variables (`r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm`) are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is still 2.
   - `j` is now `j + 1` and must be greater than 4 (since it was originally greater than 3).
   - `r` remains 2.
   - `l` remains 3.
   - `over_sum` remains `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.
   - `sm` remains `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 4, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**
