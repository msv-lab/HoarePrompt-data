Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2 or more, `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `sm` by summing up the elements from the start of the list `lst` up to index `i-1` (which is just the first element since `i` is 1), summing up the elements from index `j+1` to the end of the list, and adding the square of the distance between `j` and `i` (which is `(j - i + 1) ** 2`). Since `i` is 1, the first part of the sum is just the first element of the list. The second part of the sum involves elements from `j+1` to the end, and the third part is the square of `j - 1` (since `i` is 1).
