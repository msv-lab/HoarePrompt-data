Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is len(lst), `r` is 2, `l` is 5, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2 because the loop increments `j` but does not change `i`. The value of `j` becomes equal to the length of `lst` since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `lst` and eventually `j` exceeds the length of `lst`. The value of `r` remains 2 because it was only updated to 4 once, and subsequent updates did not make `sm` greater than `over_sum`. The value of `l` is updated to 5 because `j` reaches a point where further iterations do not find a larger `sm`. The value of `over_sum` remains `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9` because no new sum `sm` was found that exceeded this value during the loop iterations.
