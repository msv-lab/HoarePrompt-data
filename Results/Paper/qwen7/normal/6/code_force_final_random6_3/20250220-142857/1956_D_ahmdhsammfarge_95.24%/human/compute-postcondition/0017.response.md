Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + (3 - 0 + 1) ** 2, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to the sum of elements before index `i` (which is 0), elements after index `j` (which is 3), and the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` inclusive. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, there are 4 elements in total between `i` and `j` (inclusive). Thus, `(j - i + 1) ** 2` equals `4 ** 2` which is 16. Therefore, `sm` is updated to `3 + 16`. The values of `j`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.
