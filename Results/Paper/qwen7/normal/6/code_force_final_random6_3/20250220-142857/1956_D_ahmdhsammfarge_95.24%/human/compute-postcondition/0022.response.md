Output State: **i is 0, j is len(lst) - 1, r is 0, l is len(lst) - 1, over_sum is the maximum value of sm calculated during the loop executions.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will remain 0 because the loop increments `j` but does not change `i` within the loop body. The variable `j` will be set to `len(lst) - 1` because the loop runs from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. The variables `r` and `l` will both be set to `0` and `len(lst) - 1` respectively, as these are the indices that produced the maximum value of `sm`. The variable `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` calculated during any iteration of the loop.
