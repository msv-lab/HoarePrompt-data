The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It replaces the sublist in `lst` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) with a list of `r - l + 1` elements, each element being equal to `r - l + 1`. The function appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls another function `func_2(r, l, ops)`. After performing these operations, the function returns the modified list `lst`.
