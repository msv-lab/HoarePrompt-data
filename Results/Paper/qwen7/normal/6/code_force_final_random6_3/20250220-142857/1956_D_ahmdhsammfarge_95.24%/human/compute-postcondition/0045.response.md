Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `i + 1, len(lst)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will start when `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`. Given that `i` is 2, the loop will start when `j` is in the range from `3` to `len(lst)`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is `len(lst)`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range `i + 1` to `len(lst)`. Since `i` is 2, the loop will not execute because `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, which is not less than `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be set to a value that is greater than `i + 1` (which is 3). Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be a value such that the loop condition is satisfied.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` is already 2, so no change is needed for `i`.
- `j` must be adjusted to a value that is greater than `i + 1` (which is 3).
- `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 3, `r` is 1, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9***
