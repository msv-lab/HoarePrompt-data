Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `over_sum` equals `sm`, `r` is 1, `l` is 3, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` unpacks the list `[i, j]` into the variables `r` and `l`. Given the initial values, `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, so `r` becomes 1 and `l` becomes 4. The other variables (`sm`, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l`) retain their original values.
