Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers `p`, a list of integers `s`, and a positive integer `k`. It returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, where `cur` holds the final value after the last iteration (`cur + a[s]`), `vis[s]` is marked as 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` after the loop ends.**
