Output State: **`vis[s]` is 1, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**.

Explanation: The line `vis[s] = 1` sets the value of `vis[s]` to 1. The other variables (`mx`, `cur`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged from their previous values as no operations were performed on them in this line of code.
