Output State: **`mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[s]), `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cur += a[s]` increments the value of `cur` by `a[s]`. Given that `cur` was initially 0, after the operation, `cur` becomes `a[s]`. The values of `mx` and `vis[s]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
