Output State: **`mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[s]), `cur` is 0, `vis[s]` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `mx` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the sum of `cur` (which is 0) and `k * a[s]`. Since `cur` is 0, the new value of `mx` depends on the value of `k * a[s]`. The values of `cur` and `vis[s]` remain unchanged.
