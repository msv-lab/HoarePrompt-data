### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game."

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` over `k` turns.
2. **Logic**:
   - It initializes `mx` to store the maximum score encountered.
   - `cur` keeps track of the current score.
   - `vis` is used to mark visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - It iterates through the positions based on the permutation `p` until `k` reaches 0 or all positions are visited.
   - During each iteration, it updates `mx` and `cur` and then moves to the next position in the permutation.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`.

#### Correctness Check:
- The function correctly simulates the game for a single player, considering the possibility of moving to the next position in the permutation or staying at the current position.
- However, the main program only calls `func_1` once for each player, passing the starting positions `pb` and `ps` minus 1 (since indices start from 0).
- This means the function only considers the optimal path for one player, not both players making simultaneous moves.

#### Example Test Case:
Let's re-examine the example test case provided:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation:**
- Starting positions: `P_B = 3` and `P_S = 2`.
- Permutation: `[3, 1, 2, 0]`.
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`.

**Game Simulation:**
1. **Bodya's Turn:**
   - Start at position 3.
   - First turn: Score = 6, stay at position 3.
   - Second turn: Score = 6 + 7 = 13, stay at position 3.
   - Final score: 13.

2. **Sasha's Turn:**
   - Start at position 2.
   - First turn: Score = 5, move to position 1.
   - Second turn: Score = 5 + 2 = 7, stay at position 1.
   - Final score: 7.

Since Bodya's score (13) is greater than Sasha's score (7), Bodya wins.

**Program Behavior:**
- The program correctly calculates the score for each player using `func_1`.
- It then compares the scores and prints the appropriate result.

Given that the function `func_1` correctly simulates the game for a single player and the main program correctly uses this function to compare the scores of both players, the provided program is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement.
