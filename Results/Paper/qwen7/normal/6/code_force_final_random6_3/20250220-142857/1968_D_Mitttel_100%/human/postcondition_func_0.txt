The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers `p`, a list of integers `s`, and a positive integer `k`. It iterates through the list `s` based on the permutation `p`, updating the maximum value `mx` and the current sum `cur` until `k` reaches 0. After completing the iterations, it returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for the last iteration.
