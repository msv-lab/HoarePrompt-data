Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `cnt[i]` is either 0 or equal to 1.
  - `t` is increased by 1.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(N):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `N-1`.
   - There are no other variables directly modified within the loop head itself (i.e., no `t` or `N` are modified here).

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N`.
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, after one iteration, `i` will be `1` if it started from `0`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The condition `cnt[i]` being either 0 or 1 remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `cnt` in the loop head.
   - `t` is increased by 1, so after one iteration, `t` will be increased by another 1, making it `t + 2`.

### Conclusion:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1` (assuming it started from `0`).
- `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1.
- `t` is increased by 1 again, making it `t + 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`cnt[i]` is either 0 or equal to 1, `t` is increased by 2**
