Postcondition: **`t` is 6, `i` is 8 + N, `a` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` remains a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`.**
