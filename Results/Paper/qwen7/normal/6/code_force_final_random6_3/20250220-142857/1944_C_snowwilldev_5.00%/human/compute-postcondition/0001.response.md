Output State: **`N` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `N`. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case is undefined until input is provided. The output state indicates that `N` now holds the integer value of the input provided by the user.
