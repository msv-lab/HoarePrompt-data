Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 6.
- `i` is defined as `8 + N`, where `N` is not specified. Since `N` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. However, the input string is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0. This means `cnt` is a dictionary-like object where any key access returns 0 if the key does not exist.

The print statement is `print(i)`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `8 + N`, but since `N` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **8 + N**
