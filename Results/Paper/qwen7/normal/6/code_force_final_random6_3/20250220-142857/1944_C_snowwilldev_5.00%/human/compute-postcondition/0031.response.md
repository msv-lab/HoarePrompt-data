Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `N`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 2
   - `i` is 4
   - `N` is greater than 0

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`. Since `i` is currently 4 and `N` is greater than 0, the loop will execute if `i` is incremented and remains less than `N`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 5.
   - `N` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains 2 (unchanged)
- `i` becomes 5
- `N` must still be greater than 0

State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 5, and `N` is greater than 0**
