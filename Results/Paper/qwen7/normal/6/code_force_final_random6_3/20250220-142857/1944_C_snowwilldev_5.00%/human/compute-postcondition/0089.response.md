Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `N`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is `i + 1` (meaning `i` was incremented in the previous iteration).
   - `N` is the same as it was before.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still be less than `N`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `i + 2`.
   - `N` remains the same.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is not directly affected by the loop head but by the loop body, so its state does not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `N` is the same, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**.
