Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t` and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional structure.
