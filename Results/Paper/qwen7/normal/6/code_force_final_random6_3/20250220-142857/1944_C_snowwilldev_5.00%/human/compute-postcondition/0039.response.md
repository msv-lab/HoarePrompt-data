Output State: **t is 3, i is 6, N is greater than 0.**

In the given loop, the variable `t` increments by 1 each time the condition `cnt[i] == 1` is met. The loop breaks when either `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. From the provided states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration (`i` becomes 4), `t` is 2.
- After the second iteration (`i` becomes 5), `t` remains 2 because the condition `cnt[i] == 1` was not met again (since `t` already reached 2, the loop would break).
- After the third iteration (`i` becomes 6), `t` becomes 3 because the condition `cnt[5] == 1` was met, incrementing `t` from 2 to 3. Since `t` now meets the condition `t >= 2`, the loop breaks.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 3, `i` will be 6 (as it increments by 1 with each iteration without breaking), and `N` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.
