Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt[a[i]]` was undefined before, it means `a[1]` was not previously a key in `cnt`. After the increment, `cnt[a[1]]` becomes 1. The value of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, but `i` is now 2 because array indices typically increment after an operation.
