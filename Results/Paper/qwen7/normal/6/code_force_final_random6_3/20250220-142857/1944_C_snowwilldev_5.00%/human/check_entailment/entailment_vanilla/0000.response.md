Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and checks if there is at least one occurrence of each number.
   - If a number `i` has exactly one occurrence (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments the counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if a number `i` has no occurrences (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Game Logic**:
   - The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.
   - Instead, it directly determines the MEX based on the initial counts of elements, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The given program does not consider the sequence of moves and the strategic choices made by both players during their turns.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game properly. For example, in the first test case, the correct MEX should be 2, but the program might output a different value based on the initial counts.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

### Correctness

**False**
