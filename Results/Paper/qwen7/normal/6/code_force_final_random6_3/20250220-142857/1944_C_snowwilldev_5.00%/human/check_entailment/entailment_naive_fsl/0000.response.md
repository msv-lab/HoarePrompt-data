Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c`. According to the problem description, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, and the game ends when `a` is empty. The final score is the MEX of the array `c`.

The program attempts to count the occurrences of each number in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. It then iterates through the range `[0, N)` and prints the first index `i` where either `cnt[i] == 1` or `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. However, this approach does not simulate the game process correctly.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct game process would be:
1. Alice picks `0` and appends it to `c`, so `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 1, 1]`.
2. Bob picks `0` and removes it from `a`, so `a = [1, 1]`.
3. Alice picks `1` and appends it to `c`, so `c = [0, 1]` and `a = [1]`.
4. Bob picks `1` and removes it from `a`, so `a = []`.
5. The final array `c = [0, 1]`, and the MEX is `2`.

However, the program will incorrectly print `0` because it checks the conditions prematurely and does not simulate the game process accurately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
