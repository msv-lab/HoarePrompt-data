Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body increments `cnt[a[i]]` by 1. However, the exact values of `a[i]` and `cnt` are not provided, so we focus on the variables directly involved in the loop head.

3. **Determine the State Changes**: 
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The variable `N` remains constant throughout the loop.

4. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

5. **Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given this information, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `N` remains the same.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration includes `cnt[a[i]]` being incremented, we don't need to explicitly mention it here as it will be updated in the next iteration based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `N` is the same**
