Output State: **`k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `*_, k = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by `R()`. The `*` operator is used to ignore all elements except the last one, which is assigned to `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still 0.
