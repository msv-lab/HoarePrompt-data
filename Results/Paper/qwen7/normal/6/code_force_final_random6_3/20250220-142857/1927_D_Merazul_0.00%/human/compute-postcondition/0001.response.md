Output State: **`t` is reduced to a single integer from its initial positive integer value, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers.**

The code `t, = R()` takes the input using the lambda function `R`, which splits the input into integers. Since `t` is expected to be a single value, it is assigned the first (and only) integer from the input. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
