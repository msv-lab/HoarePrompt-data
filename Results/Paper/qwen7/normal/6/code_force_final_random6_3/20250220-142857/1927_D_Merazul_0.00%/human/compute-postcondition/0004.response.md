Output State: **`t` is a positive integer reduced by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split by the lambda function `R()`**.

The code `_*, k = R()` unpacks the result of the lambda function `R()`, which presumably takes an input and splits it into multiple parts. The first part (denoted by `_*) is ignored, and the second part is assigned to `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
