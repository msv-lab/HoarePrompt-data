Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be at least 3, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False**

Explanation: The code `f &= u | v` updates the value of `f`. Since `u` is False and `v` is False, `u | v` evaluates to False. Therefore, `f &= False` results in `f` remaining False. All other variables remain unchanged.
