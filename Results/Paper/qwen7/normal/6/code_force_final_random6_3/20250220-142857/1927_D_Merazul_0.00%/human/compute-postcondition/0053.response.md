Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be at least 3, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False, `m` is `m - (False & ~False)` which simplifies to `m - 0` or simply `m` since anything ANDed with False is False.**

In this case, `u` is False and `v` is False, so `~v` is True. However, `u & ~v` is False because anything ANDed with False results in False. Thus, `m` remains unchanged.
