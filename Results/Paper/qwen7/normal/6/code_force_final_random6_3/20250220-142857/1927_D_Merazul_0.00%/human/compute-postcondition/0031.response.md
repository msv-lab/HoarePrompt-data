Output State: **`t` is True-1, `f` is False, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is at least 3, `u` is always False, `v` is always False, `m` is 0, `n` is -k, `b` is not defined.**

The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially `True`, after decrementing by 1, `t` becomes `True-1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
