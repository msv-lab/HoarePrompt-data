### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) where \(a_i \neq a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \(-1 -1\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` is defined but does not match the problem requirements.
   - The code uses some lambda functions and unpacking operations that are not relevant to solving the problem.
   - It reads input and processes it in a way that does not align with the problem statement.
   - Variables like `a` and `b` are sets of integers, but the logic to find the required indices is missing.
   - The condition checking and printing part seems unrelated to the problem's requirements.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - We should identify if there are at least two distinct elements in this subarray.
   - If there are, we need to find and print one such pair of indices.
   - If not, we should print \(-1 -1\).

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Read the input as per the problem statement.
   - For each query, extract the subarray and check for distinct elements.
   - If distinct elements exist, find and print one pair of indices.
   - If not, print \(-1 -1\).

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program but does not reflect the actual logic needed to solve the problem.
   - The code does not process the subarrays for each query to find distinct elements.
   - The logic for setting `f`, `m`, and `n` does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The final print statement does not correctly handle the output format for each query.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not process the subarrays to find distinct elements and does not produce the correct output format for each query.
   - The annotated code further confirms that the logic is flawed and does not match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Final: False**
