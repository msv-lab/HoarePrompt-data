Output State: **`t` is a positive integer reduced by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a set of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split by the lambda function `R()`, `b` is a set of integers generated by `R()`**.

Explanation: The line `b = {*R()}` creates a set `b` by calling the function `R()`. The function `R()` is not defined in the initial state, so it could generate any set of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
