Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `a` equals `b`, then `a` equals `b`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `T` remains within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` remains 0, `a` equals 1 if it originally equals 1, and if `a` is odd, it remains unchanged. If `a` is even, it is either changed to a value greater than `b` or to an odd number, or it remains less than or equal to `b`.
