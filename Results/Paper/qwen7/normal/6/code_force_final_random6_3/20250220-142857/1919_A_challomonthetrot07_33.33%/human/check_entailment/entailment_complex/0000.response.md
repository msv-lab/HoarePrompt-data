Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. The logic within the loop checks various conditions to determine the winner based on the initial values of `a` and `b`.
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.
3. These conditions cover all possible scenarios based on the problem statement and the provided examples.
4. The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the expected results for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
