Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is even.
- Either `a % 2 != 0` or `b % 2 != 1`.
- `a` is greater than `b`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any other variables.

Output: **Bob**
