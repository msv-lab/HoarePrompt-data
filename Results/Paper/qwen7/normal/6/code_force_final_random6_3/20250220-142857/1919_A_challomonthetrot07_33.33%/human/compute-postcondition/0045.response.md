Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them using space as a delimiter, then converts each string to an integer and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
