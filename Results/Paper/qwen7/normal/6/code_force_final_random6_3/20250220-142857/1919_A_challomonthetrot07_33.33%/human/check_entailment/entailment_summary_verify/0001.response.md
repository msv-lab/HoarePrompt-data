### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to verify the correctness of the solution.

1. **Problem Description and Input/Output**:
   - The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets.
   - Each test case consists of two integers \(a\) and \(b\), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The game rules and the optimal strategy are well-defined.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, taking input values for \(a\) and \(b\) and printing the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each test case.
   - The function checks various conditions to determine the winner based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Conditions Checked**:
   - **Case 1**: \(a == b\) → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 2**: \(a == 1\) → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 3**: \(b == 1\) → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 4**: \(a \% 2 == 1\) → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 5**: \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 1\) → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 6**: \(a > b\) → Print 'Bob'
   - **Default Case**: Print 'Alice'

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that the player who has an odd number of coins can always force the opponent into a situation where they have an even number of coins, eventually leading to a win.
   - Conversely, the player who has an even number of coins is at risk of being forced into a situation where they have an odd number of coins, potentially leading to a loss.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's consider the conditions and their implications:
     - **Case 1**: \(a == b\) → Both players have the same number of coins, so Bob wins.
     - **Case 2**: \(a == 1\) → Alice can force Bob into a situation where he has 0 coins, so Alice wins.
     - **Case 3**: \(b == 1\) → Bob can force Alice into a situation where she has 0 coins, so Bob wins.
     - **Case 4**: \(a \% 2 == 1\) → Bob can force Alice into a situation where she has 0 coins, so Bob wins.
     - **Case 5**: \(a \% 2 == 0\) and \(b \% 2 == 1\) → Alice can force Bob into a situation where he has 0 coins, so Alice wins.
     - **Case 6**: \(a > b\) → Bob can force Alice into a situation where she has 0 coins, so Bob wins.
     - **Default Case**: Print 'Alice' (This case should be re-evaluated based on the optimal strategy).

6. **Re-evaluation of Default Case**:
   - The default case should handle the scenario where neither of the above conditions is met. Based on the optimal strategy, if \(a\) is even and \(b\) is even, the player with the smaller number of coins will lose. However, the current default case simply prints 'Alice', which might not cover all scenarios correctly.

Given the analysis, the program does not fully cover all possible scenarios and may not always produce the correct result. For example, in the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and \(a < b\), the program incorrectly prints 'Alice' instead of 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
