Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `T`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `T`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer input.
   - `b` is the second integer input.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < T`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `T` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input**.
