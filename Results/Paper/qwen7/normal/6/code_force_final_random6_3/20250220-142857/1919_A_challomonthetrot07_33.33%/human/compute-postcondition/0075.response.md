Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `a`, and `b`. It does not accept `t`, `a`, and `b` as direct parameters but rather seems to handle them within its body, returning different information depending on the values of these variables.
