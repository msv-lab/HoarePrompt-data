Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first one to `a` and the second one to `b`. The variable `T` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged with its value being 2.
