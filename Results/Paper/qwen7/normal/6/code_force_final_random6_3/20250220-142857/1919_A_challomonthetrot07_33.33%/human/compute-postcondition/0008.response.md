Output: **Alice**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` equals 1. The print statement simply outputs the string 'Alice', and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables. Therefore, the output is **Alice**.
