Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `s` based on the number of consecutive losses `x`, but it does not account for the varying bet amounts based on wins and losses as per the problem description. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 1 1`
- Expected Output: `NO`

Hereâ€™s why the program fails:
- For `k=2`, `x=1`, and `a=1`, Sasha starts with 1 coin.
- According to the problem, Sasha can only place 1 coin initially because he cannot lose more than 1 time in a row.
- If he loses, he cannot place any more bets since he would have no coins left.
- Therefore, Sasha cannot guarantee having more than 1 coin, which contradicts the expected output of `NO`.

The program incorrectly assumes that Sasha can always increase his bet amount, which is not the case according to the problem description. Hence, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
