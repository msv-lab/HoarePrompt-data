Output State: The value of `s` will be 8, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 5.

Explanation: From the given information, we can observe that the value of `s` increases by 2 with each iteration of the loop. Starting from `s = 1` (initial state), after the first iteration, `s` becomes 2, after the second iteration, `s` becomes 4, and after the third iteration, `s` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration, `s` will be 8. The variable `i` increments by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations, `i` will be 4. However, since the loop uses `range(x)`, `i` will be 5 when the loop finishes because it stops after the last index, which is `x-1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
