Output State: The loop will execute `x` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`, `x` will remain as the initial value it had before the loop started, `s` will be \(2^{(x-1)}\).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `x`, `x` itself will stay the same, and `s` will be double the previous value of `s` for each iteration, starting from 1. Specifically, `s` will be \(2^{(x-1)}\).
