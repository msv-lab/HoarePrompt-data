Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is `int(x)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5)`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: The loop will increment `i` by 1, so the next value of `i` will be 5.
4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`.

### Checking the Condition for the Next Iteration:
- We need to check if `5 <= int(x ** 0.5)`.
- Since `i` was 4 in the previous iteration, the loop will continue if `int(x ** 0.5) >= 5`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `x` remains the same.
- `i` will be incremented to 5.
- `n` remains the same (since it is derived from `x`).

### Final State:
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is 5.
- `n` is `int(x)`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 5, `n` is `int(x)`**
