Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of `x`, but the implementation is incorrect. It should return the divisors of `x` in ascending order. However, the current implementation returns them in a reversed order, which will not correctly identify the possible values of `k`.

2. **Main Logic**: 
   - The logic checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even. If they are, it calls `func_1` on these values.
   - `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of the given number, but due to the incorrect implementation, it doesn't provide the correct divisors.
   - The logic then filters these divisors to find those that satisfy certain conditions, but since `func_1` returns incorrect results, the filtering step won't work as intended.

3. **Output**: 
   - The output is the length of the unique set of filtered divisors, which will be incorrect because the divisors themselves are incorrect.

Given the issues with the `func_1` function and the overall logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
