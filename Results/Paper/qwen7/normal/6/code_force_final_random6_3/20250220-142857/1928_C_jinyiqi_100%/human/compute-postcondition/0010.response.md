Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\); `i` is 4; `n` is `int(x)`; `output2` is a list containing the value of `int(x / i)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to the list `output2`. Since `i` is 4, the value added to `output2` is `int(x / 4)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
