Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Once `i` exceeds the square root of `x`, the loop will terminate. `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` starting from 1 up to the largest divisor less than or equal to the square root of `x`. `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients for each divisor in `output1`.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, `output1` will be a list of all integers `d` such that `1 <= d <= sqrt(x)` and `x % d == 0`. Similarly, `output2` will be a list of all integers `q` such that `1 <= q <= sqrt(x)` and `x % d == 0`, where `d` and `q` are pairs of divisors of `x` (i.e., `d * q = x`). The values of `x` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.
