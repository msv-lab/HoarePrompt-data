Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of the `numbers` list and goes until the end. The variable `num` is being updated in each iteration.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `hcf` and `num`.
   - `num` is `numbers[2]`.
   - `hcf` is updated to the GCD of `hcf` and `num`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through `numbers[1:]`, the next value of `num` will be `numbers[3]` (the next element after `numbers[2]`).
   - The `hcf` will be updated to the GCD of the current `hcf` and the new `num`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `hcf` will be updated to the GCD of the current `hcf` and `numbers[3]`.
   - `num` will be set to `numbers[3]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `hcf` and `numbers[3]`, and `num` is `numbers[3]`**.
