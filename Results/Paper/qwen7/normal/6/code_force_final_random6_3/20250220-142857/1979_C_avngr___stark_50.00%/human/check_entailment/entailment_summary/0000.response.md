Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n < k_1 \cdot x_1 \land x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n < k_2 \cdot x_2 \land \ldots \land x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n < k_n \cdot x_n\).

2. **Solution Approach**: The provided code aims to solve this by:
   - Calculating the product of all multipliers \(k_i\).
   - Dividing this product by each \(k_i\) to get potential bet amounts.
   - Finding the GCD of these bet amounts.
   - Dividing each bet amount by the GCD to ensure they are relatively prime.
   - Checking if the sum of these bet amounts is less than the reduced product divided by the GCD.
   - Printing the bet amounts if the condition is met; otherwise, printing -1.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `gcd` function from the `math` module is used correctly.
   - The product `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers.
   - The list `c` is created by dividing `m` by each \(k_i\).
   - The GCD of the list `c` is calculated using `func_1`.
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the GCD to ensure they are relatively prime.
   - The sum of `c` is compared with the reduced product divided by the GCD.
   - If the sum is less than the reduced product divided by the GCD, the bet amounts are printed; otherwise, -1 is printed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the sum of the bet amounts is not less than the reduced product divided by the GCD by printing -1.
   - The code ensures that the bet amounts are relatively prime, which helps in finding a valid distribution.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins or determine if it's impossible.
   - The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
