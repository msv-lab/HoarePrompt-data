Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received for each winning outcome. The provided code attempts to solve this by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then dividing it by each multiplier to get the required bets.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the LCM of the multipliers when considering their prime factorization.
   - It then divides this product by each multiplier to get a list of values (`c`). These values represent the minimum amounts to bet on each outcome so that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM.
   - The GCD of these values is calculated using the `func_1` function, which correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of these values divided by the GCD is still less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the adjusted values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the LCM and distributing the bets is sound.
   - The GCD calculation is correctly implemented.
   - The final check ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
