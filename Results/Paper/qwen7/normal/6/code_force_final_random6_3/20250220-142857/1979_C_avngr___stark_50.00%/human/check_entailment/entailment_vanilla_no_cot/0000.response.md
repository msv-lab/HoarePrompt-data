Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Name**: The function `func_1` is used in the main logic but is called with an undefined function name `hcf`. It should be called as `gcd` since the function from the `math` module is named `gcd`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem. Instead, the goal is to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Incorrect Use of GCD**: The use of GCD is not appropriate for finding the required distribution of bets. The GCD operation is used to find the highest common factor, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Bets**: The logic for checking if the sum of bets is less than the winnings for any outcome and printing the bets is flawed. The approach to calculate and print the bets needs to be corrected.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum k value
    min_k = min(k)
    
    # Calculate the total bet such that it is less than the smallest win
    total_bet = min_k - 1
    
    # Distribute the total bet among all outcomes
    bets = [total_bet // min_k] * n
    remaining = total_bet % min_k
    
    # Distribute the remaining bet to ensure the total bet is less than the smallest win
    for i in range(remaining):
        bets[i] += 1
    
    # Check if the distribution is valid
    if sum(bets) * min_k >= min_k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the total bet is less than the smallest win and distributes the bets accordingly.
