Output State: **`hcf` is the GCD of `hcf` and `numbers[3]`, and `hcf` is updated to be the GCD of `hcf` and `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates `hcf` to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its current value (`hcf`) and `num`, which is `numbers[3]`. Therefore, `hcf` is now the GCD of `hcf` and `numbers[3]`. The initial state's condition that `hcf` is the GCD of `hcf` and `numbers[3]` remains true, and `num` is still equal to `numbers[3]`.
