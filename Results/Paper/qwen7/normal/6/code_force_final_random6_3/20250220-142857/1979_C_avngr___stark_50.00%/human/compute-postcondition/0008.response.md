Output State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of the entire list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of the current `hcf` value and the next element in the list, effectively combining all elements in the list through repeated application of the GCD operation.
