Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]`. The objects involved here are:
   - `num`: This variable will take the value of each element in `numbers[1:]`.
   - `numbers`: This is the list from which `num` is being taken.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `hcf` is set to the first element of the list `numbers`. This means `hcf` is currently `numbers[0]`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - The list `numbers` contains `n` integers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\) such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for each \(i\).

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `num` taking the value of `numbers[1]` (the second element of `numbers`).
   - Therefore, the initial value of `num` should be `numbers[1]`.
   - The list `numbers` should have at least two elements to ensure that `numbers[1]` exists.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `hcf` remains as the first element of `numbers`, which is `numbers[0]`.
- `num` should be set to `numbers[1]` to start the loop.
- `numbers` must have at least two elements to ensure the loop can start.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`hcf` is `numbers[0]`, `num` is `numbers[1]`, and `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.**

State: **`hcf` is `numbers[0]`, `num` is `numbers[1]`, and `numbers` must have at least 2 elements**
