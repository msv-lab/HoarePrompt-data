The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s` containing lowercase Latin letters. It calculates the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in `s` across all test cases. For each test case, it prints the result of `(number of 'map' occurrences + number of 'pie' occurrences - number of 'mapie' occurrences)`. The final state of the program includes the last input integer `a`, the last string `s`, and the cumulative counts of 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' occurrences.
