Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the last input integer provided, `s` will be the last string input by the user, `x` will be the total number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` across all iterations, `y` will be the total number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` across all iterations, and `z` will be the total number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s` across all iterations. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the cumulative counts from all test cases.
