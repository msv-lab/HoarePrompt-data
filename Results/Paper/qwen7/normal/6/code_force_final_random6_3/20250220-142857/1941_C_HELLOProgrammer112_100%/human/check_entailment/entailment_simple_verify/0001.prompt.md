You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length of n across all test cases not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the last input integer provided, `s` will be the last string input by the user, `x` will be the total number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` across all iterations, `y` will be the total number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` across all iterations, and `z` will be the total number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s` across all iterations. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the cumulative counts from all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie".

3. **Calculating Minimum Deletions:**
   - The formula used to calculate the minimum deletions is `x + y - z`, where:
     - `x` is the count of "map".
     - `y` is the count of "pie".
     - `z` is the count of "mapie".
   - The logic behind this formula is that every occurrence of "mapie" is counted twice (once as "map" and once as "pie"), so we subtract `z` to avoid double-counting.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider an example to see if the formula works correctly:

- **Test Case:**
  - `s = "mmapnapie"`
  - `x = s.count('map') = 2`
  - `y = s.count('pie') = 1`
  - `z = s.count('mapie') = 1`

- **Calculation:**
  - `x + y - z = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2`

- **Expected Output:**
  - We need to remove the 4th and 9th characters to make the string "mmapnapie" beautiful.
  - So, the expected output is `2`.

However, the program prints `2`, which matches our expectation.

### Edge Cases:

- **Case with "mapie":**
  - If the string contains "mapie", it should be removed only once.
  - For example, in "mapie", `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`, so `x + y - z = 1`.

- **Case with no "map" or "pie":**
  - If the string does not contain "map" or "pie", `x = 0` and `y = 0`, so `x + y - z = 0`.

- **Case with multiple "map" and "pie":**
  - For example, in "mmappie", `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`, so `x + y - z = 2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The formula `x + y - z` accurately accounts for the overlapping counts of "map" and "pie".

Correctness: **True**
