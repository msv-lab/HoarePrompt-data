Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the new input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the count of 'mapie' in `s`.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
