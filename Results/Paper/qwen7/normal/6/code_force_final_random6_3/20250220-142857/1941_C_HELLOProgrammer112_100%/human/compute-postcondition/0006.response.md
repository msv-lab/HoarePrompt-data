Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

The expression `x + y - z` calculates the total number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, minus the number of occurrences of 'mapie'. This is because every occurrence of 'mapie' is counted in both 'map' and 'pie', so it needs to be subtracted once to avoid double-counting.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of this calculation.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, and z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s)**
