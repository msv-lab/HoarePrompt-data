Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code counts the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `x`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
