You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length of n across all test cases not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the last input integer provided, `s` will be the last string input by the user, `x` will be the total number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` across all iterations, `y` will be the total number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` across all iterations, and `z` will be the total number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s` across all iterations. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the cumulative counts from all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. For each test case, the function returns information about the string `s` based on the value of `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
