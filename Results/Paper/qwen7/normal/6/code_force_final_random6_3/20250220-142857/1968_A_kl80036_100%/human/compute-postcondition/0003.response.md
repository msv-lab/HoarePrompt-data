Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `t` must be within the range 1 to 1000.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is `x - 1`.

The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Since `x` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. Therefore, we express `y` in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is an input integer)**
