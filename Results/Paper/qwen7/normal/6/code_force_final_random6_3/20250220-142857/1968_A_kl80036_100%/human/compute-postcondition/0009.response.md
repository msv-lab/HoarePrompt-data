Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `x` is the integer entered by the user and is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input by the user to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `t`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, it is mentioned that `int(input())` must be greater than 1, which means `x` is also greater than 1.
