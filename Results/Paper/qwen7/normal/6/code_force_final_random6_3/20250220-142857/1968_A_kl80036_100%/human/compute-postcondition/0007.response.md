Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, but its specific value is not relevant for determining the output of the print statement.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

The print statement is `print(y)`, which means it will print the value of `y`.

Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, the output will be the value of `x` minus 1.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is the input integer)**
