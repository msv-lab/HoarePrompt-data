Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers: `t` and `x`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function does not return any value directly but implies that it might perform some operations or checks using these integers within its body.**

However, based on the provided output cases, it seems the function should actually take two parameters `t` and `x`. Let's correct that:
