Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cd` is 1 and `i` is 1 if `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`.
   - Otherwise, `cd` is 0 and `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Assess the current value of `i`**: Since `i` is 1, we need to check if the loop can continue based on the condition `i < len(nums) - 2`.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - If the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `len(nums) - 2`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(nums) - 2`, so we need to adjust these.
   - Since `i` will be incremented to 2, and assuming `len(nums)` does not change, the condition `i < len(nums) - 2` will hold true if `len(nums) > 4`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cd` is 0, `i` is 2** (assuming the loop condition holds true and `len(nums) > 4`).
