Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer. These integers are stored in the list `nums`. The initial value of `n` remains unchanged, but now `nums` holds the list of integers derived from the input.
