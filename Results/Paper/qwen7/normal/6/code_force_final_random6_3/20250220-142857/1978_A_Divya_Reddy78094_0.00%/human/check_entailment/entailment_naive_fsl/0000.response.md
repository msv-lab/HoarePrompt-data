Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. According to the problem description, Alice needs to divide the books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages read. However, the provided solution only considers the sum of the two largest numbers in the sorted list, which does not guarantee the maximum total number of pages read.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
2 2 3 2 2
```
The correct approach would be to split the books into two piles such that the sum of the maximum pages from each pile is maximized. In this case, splitting the books into piles [2, 3, 2] and [2, 2] would result in reading 3 + 2 = 5 pages. However, the program would incorrectly output 2 + 2 = 4 pages.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
