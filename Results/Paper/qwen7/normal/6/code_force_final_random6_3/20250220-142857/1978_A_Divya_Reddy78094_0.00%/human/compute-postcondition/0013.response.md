Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is t + 1, `nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is updated to a new list containing integers split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The initial state of `n` and `t` remains unchanged, and `nums` is updated to reflect the newly created list of integers.
