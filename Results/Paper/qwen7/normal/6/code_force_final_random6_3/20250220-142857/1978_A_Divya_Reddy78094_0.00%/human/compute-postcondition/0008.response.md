Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `t` is the number of iterations already completed, `nums` is updated to a new list of integers converted from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. The original `nums` list was sorted in descending order, but this information is lost since the new `nums` is not sorted. The other variables (`n`, `t`) remain unchanged.
