Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s` after the operation, `s` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using the default delimiter (which is whitespace), converts the second element of this list to an integer, and assigns it to `b`. The first element remains `a`, and `s` is updated to the new input string as specified in the initial state.
