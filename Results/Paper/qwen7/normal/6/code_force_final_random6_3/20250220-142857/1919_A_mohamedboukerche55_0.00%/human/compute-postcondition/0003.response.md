Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into a list using `split()`, which separates the string by whitespace. The first element of the resulting list is converted to an integer and assigned to `a`, while the second element is converted to an integer and assigned to `b`. The values of `i` and the original string `s` remain unchanged.
