Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in their wallets.
- The annotated program suggests that the function processes each test case by checking if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it prints 'bob '; if the sum is odd, it prints 'alice'.
- This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game, where the player whose turn it is when the sum of the coins is even will lose, and the player whose turn it is when the sum is odd will win.
- The provided examples in the problem statement also support this logic, showing that the function correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
