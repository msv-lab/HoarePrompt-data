Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is the updated input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is an integer from the second element of the split string representation of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts the list to a list of strings (which is redundant since it's already a list of strings), and then assigns the integer value of the second element in the list (index 1) to `b`. The values of `i`, `s`, `a`, and the fact that `b` is derived from the second element of the split string remain unchanged except for the conversion of the second element to an integer.
