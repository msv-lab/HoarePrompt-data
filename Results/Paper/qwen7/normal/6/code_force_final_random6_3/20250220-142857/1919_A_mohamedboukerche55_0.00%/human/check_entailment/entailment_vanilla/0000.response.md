Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - It splits the string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively.

3. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'alice'.

### Problem Description Analysis

- **Game Rules**:
  - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
  - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
  - After swapping, a player removes one coin from their current wallet (if non-empty).
  - The player who cannot make a move loses.

- **Optimal Play**:
  - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
  - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

### Correctness of the Given Program

- The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of coins is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, Bob can always win because he can force Alice into a position where she will eventually run out of moves.
- If the sum is odd, Alice can always win because she can force Bob into a position where he will eventually run out of moves.

Given that the program correctly implements the winning condition based on the parity of the total number of coins, the program is correct.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
