Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description. The program simply checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" respectively. However, the actual winning condition depends on the parity of the individual counts of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, not just their sum.

To determine the winner correctly, we need to consider the following:
- If `a` (Alice's coins) is odd and `b` (Bob's coins) is even, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob wins because he can always force Alice into a losing position.
- If both `a` and `b` are either odd or even, the game state alternates between Alice and Bob, and the player who starts (Alice) will eventually lose if both play optimally.

Given this, the correct logic should be:
```python
if (a % 2 != b % 2):
    print('Alice')
else:
    print('Bob')
```

However, the provided program does not reflect this logic. It simply checks the sum of `a` and `b`, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
