Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given rules. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The code splits the input string `s` and converts the first element to an integer `a` and the second element to `b`. However, it should directly split the input into two separate integers without converting them to a list and then back to integers.

2. **Winning Condition Logic**: The condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is not accurate for determining the winner. The correct logic should be based on the parity of the initial number of coins in Alice's wallet (`a`). Specifically, if `a` is even, Bob wins; if `a` is odd, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version correctly parses the input and uses the correct logic to determine the winner based on the parity of `a`.
