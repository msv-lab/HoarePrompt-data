Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `n - 2` to `n - 1`, `max` remains unchanged, `temp` is now a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is `n - 2`) and ends at index `i + 2` (which is `n`). This means `temp` is now a sublist of `a` containing the elements from index `n - 2` to `n - 1` and the next two elements, making it a sublist from index `n - 2` to `n + 1`. However, since the initial description mentions `temp` was originally a sorted list from index `n - 2` to `n - 1`, the new `temp` is now a sublist from `i` to `i + 2`. The variable `max` remains unchanged.
