Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, and `i` is 2; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3.**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` creates a sublist `temp` from the list `a` starting at index `i` (which is 1) and ending at index `i + 2` (which is 3). The values of `n`, `t`, `a`, `max`, and `i` remain unchanged.
