Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (number of cases), n (size of the array), and an array a of n positive integers. If n is 2, it prints the minimum element of the array. Otherwise, it finds and prints the maximum value among the second smallest elements of every possible consecutive triplet in the array a. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.**
