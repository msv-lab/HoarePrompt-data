Based on the initial state provided:

- `max` holds the maximum value among the second smallest elements (temp[1]) of every possible consecutive triplet in the list `a`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is still 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. **List `a`**: It is derived from an input string split into integers. For example, if the input string is "1 2 3 4 5", then `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Consecutive Triplets**: We consider every possible consecutive triplet in the list `a`. For the example list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the triplets are:
   - `(1, 2, 3)`
   - `(2, 3, 4)`
   - `(3, 4, 5)`

3. **Second Smallest Element in Each Triplet**: 
   - For `(1, 2, 3)`, the second smallest element is `2`.
   - For `(2, 3, 4)`, the second smallest element is `3`.
   - For `(3, 4, 5)`, the second smallest element is `4`.

4. **Max Value Among Second Smallest Elements**: The maximum value among these second smallest elements is `4`.

Therefore, the value of `max` will be `4`.

Output: **4**
