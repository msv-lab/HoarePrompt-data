Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is now `a[n - 1:n + 2]`, and `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` initially, or `max` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to be a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to `i + 2`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is now `a[n - 1:n + 2]`. The values of `i` and `max` remain unchanged from their initial states.
