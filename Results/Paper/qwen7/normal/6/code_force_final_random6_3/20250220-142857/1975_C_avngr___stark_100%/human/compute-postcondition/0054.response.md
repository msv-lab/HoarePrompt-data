Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is still equal to `temp[1]`, and `i` is 5; `temp` is now a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 5 and ending at index 7.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` originally starts from index 5 and ends at index 7, it contains three elements from the list `a`. After sorting, these elements will be in ascending order, but the exact values depend on the original values of `a[5]`, `a[6]`, and `a[7]`. However, the specific values are not provided, so we keep the description general while noting that `temp` is now sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
