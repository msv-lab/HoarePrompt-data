Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is still equal to `temp[1]`, and `i` is 5; `temp` is now the sublist of `a` starting from index 5 and ending at index 7.**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 5) and ends at index `i + 3` (which is 8). Since `temp` was previously a sublist starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, after this line of code, `temp` is updated to start from index 5 and end at index 7. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
