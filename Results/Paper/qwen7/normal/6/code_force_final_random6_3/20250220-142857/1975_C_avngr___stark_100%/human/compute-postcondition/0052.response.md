Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 5.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is still equal to `temp[1]`.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, and `temp` is sorted.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body. However, since the loop condition is `i < n - 2`, `n` must still be greater than 5 (as it was before).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.
   - `max` remains equal to `temp[1]`.
   - `i` becomes 5.
   - `temp` remains the same sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, and it remains sorted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is still equal to `temp[1]`, and `i` is 5. `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, and `temp` is sorted.**
