Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` equals 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged.
