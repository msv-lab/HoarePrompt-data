Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is now equal to `temp[1]` which is greater than the previous `max`, and `i` is 4; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, and `temp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` from index `i` (which is 4) to `i + 3` (which is 7), creating a new list `temp` that contains elements from index 4 to index 6. Since `temp` was previously sorted and the slicing operation does not change the order of elements within the slice, `temp` remains sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
