Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `n` is still 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state has `n` as an input integer, `t` as 0, `n` as still 2 (which seems redundant since `n` is already defined as an input integer), and `a` as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
2. The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
3. Since `n` is already defined as an input integer and is not modified by the code, its value remains unchanged.
4. `t` is not affected by the code, so it remains 0.
5. The value of `n` as "still 2" is redundant because `n` is already defined as an input integer, and the code does not modify it.
6. `a` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from the input.

Therefore, the output state is as described above.
