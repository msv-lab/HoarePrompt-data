Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1**.

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` which is defined as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. Since `extra_space` is not divisible by 15, adding 1 ensures that `extra_screen` is an integer representing the number of additional screens needed to accommodate the extra space. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
