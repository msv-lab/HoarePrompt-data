Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`**.

In this case, the code assigns `space_y` the value of `y * 4`. Since `y` was not defined before this line, its value remains unknown. Therefore, `space_y` is expressed as `y * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
