Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial values of `t` and `result` remain unchanged.
