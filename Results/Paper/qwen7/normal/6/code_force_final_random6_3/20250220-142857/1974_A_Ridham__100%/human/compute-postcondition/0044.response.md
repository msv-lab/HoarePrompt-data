Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `screen_require_for_y + extra_screen`, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split, `y` is updated to the second integer from the input split.**

In this output state, the variables `x` and `y` have been updated to the values obtained from the input split. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
