Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `result`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `t` being a positive integer within the specified range and `n` being an input integer, while adding that `result` is now an empty list.
