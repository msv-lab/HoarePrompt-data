Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x = x * 1` is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - `space_y = y * 4` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

3. **Total Space Calculation**:
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` calculates the total number of cells required to place all icons.

4. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The calculation `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0)` ensures that the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons is correctly determined. This accounts for the fact that a single 2x2 icon requires 2 cells, and any remaining odd icon requires an additional screen.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

6. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The condition `if space_x <= remaining_cells:` checks if there are enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons without needing an additional screen.
   - If not, the code calculates `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` and determines `extra_screen` based on the remaining cells needed to accommodate the 1x1 icons.

7. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result is correctly calculated as `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` when `space_x > remaining_cells`.

8. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in a list and printed in the correct format.

Given the above analysis, the logic of the code appears to be correct for determining the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. The calculations and conditions are appropriately handled.

Correctness: **True**
