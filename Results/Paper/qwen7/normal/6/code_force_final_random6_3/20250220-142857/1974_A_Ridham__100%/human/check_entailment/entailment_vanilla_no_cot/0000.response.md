Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Here's why:

1. **Space Calculation**: The calculation of `space_x` and `space_y` is incorrect. For `1x1` icons, each icon takes 1 cell, so `space_x` should be `x`. For `2x2` icons, each icon takes 4 cells, so `space_y` should be `y * 4`.

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for `2x2` icons (`screen_require_for_y`) is flawed. It should be calculated based on the total number of cells available per screen (15) and the number of `2x2` icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The calculation of `remaining_cells` is incorrect. It should be based on the total number of cells available per screen minus the cells already used by `2x2` icons.

4. **Final Screen Calculation**: The final number of screens required should account for both the `2x2` icons and the remaining `1x1` icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Total number of cells required for 2x2 icons
        space_y = y * 4
        # Total number of cells required for 1x1 icons
        space_x = x
        # Total number of cells available per screen
        cells_per_screen = 5 * 3
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = cells_per_screen * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        # Calculate the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons
        extra_screens = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // remaining_cells
        # Total number of screens required
        total_screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screens
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program should accurately calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
