Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `extra_space` which is the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. Since `remaining_cells` is defined as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is `x`, and `space_y` is `y * 4`, the value of `extra_space` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
