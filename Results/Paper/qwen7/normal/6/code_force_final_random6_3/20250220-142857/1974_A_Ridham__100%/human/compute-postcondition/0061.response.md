Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the lack of direct parameter declaration in the function signature, it implies that the function likely accepts a series of test cases or iterates over inputs in some form, processing each test case with `t` test instances, each containing `x` and `y`. However, without additional details on the exact operations performed on `x` and `y`, the core functionality focuses on the acceptance and processing of these specific types of inputs.
