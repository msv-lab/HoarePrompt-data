Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y` and the previous elements, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

Explanation: The line `result.append(screen_require_for_y)` appends the value of `screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The value of `remaining_cells` remains unchanged, as it was not involved in any calculation or assignment. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
