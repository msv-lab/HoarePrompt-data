### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the icons:
     - `space_x = x * 1` which is simply `x`.
     - `space_y = y * 4` which is `4y`.
     - `total_space = space_y + space_x` which is `4y + x`.

3. **Screen Requirement Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`):
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
   - This part seems correct because each 2x2 icon requires 2 cells, so the number of screens needed is `y // 2` if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons:
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This calculation is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Checking Remaining Space:**
   - The program checks if the remaining space is enough to fit all 1x1 icons:
     - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space, and the number of screens required is just `screen_require_for_y`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
       - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if there is any remainder.
   - This logic is correct but needs a small adjustment in the final calculation.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.
   - However, the final result should be the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screen)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program, I noticed that the final result should include both `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`. Therefore, the original program was almost correct but had a minor logical error in the final calculation.

**Correctness: False**

The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct calculation of the minimum number of screens needed.
