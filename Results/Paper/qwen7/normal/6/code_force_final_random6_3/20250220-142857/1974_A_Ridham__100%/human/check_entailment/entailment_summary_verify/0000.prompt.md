You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it calculates a value based on the relationship between `x`, `y`, and certain derived values like `space_x`, `space_y`, and `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, it appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates `extra_screen` and appends the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` to the result list. Finally, it prints a list of these calculated values, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

### Case Analysis
Consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`. According to the problem, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2 on the minimum number of screens.

- Each screen has 15 cells (5x3 grid).
- 4 icons of size 2x2 occupy 4 cells each, so they require \(4 / 2 = 2\) screens (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).

However, the program calculates the space required as follows:
- `space_x = x * 1 = 12`
- `space_y = y * 4 = 16`
- `total_space = space_y + space_x = 12 + 16 = 28`
- `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1 = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3`

Then it calculates the remaining cells:
- `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y = 15 * 3 - 16 = 45 - 16 = 29`

Since `space_x = 12` and `remaining_cells = 29`, the program checks if `space_x <= remaining_cells` which is true. Therefore, it concludes that only 3 screens are needed.

But, the actual calculation should be:
- Place 4 icons of size 2x2, which requires 2 screens.
- Remaining cells after placing these icons: \(15 * 2 - 16 = 30 - 16 = 14\).
- Place the remaining 12 icons of size 1x1, which will fit into the remaining 14 cells.

Thus, the minimum number of screens required is 2, not 3.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the placement of icons, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
