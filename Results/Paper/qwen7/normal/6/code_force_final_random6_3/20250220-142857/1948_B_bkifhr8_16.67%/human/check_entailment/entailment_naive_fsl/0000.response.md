Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to modify the array in place by splitting elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the array. However, the logic for modifying the array is flawed.

Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```

Expected output: `YES` because we can split the array to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` and further to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` and finally to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, making it sorted.

However, the program will not correctly handle this case. The program checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and greater than 10, and if so, it splits the element and inserts the digits. This logic is incomplete and does not ensure that the array will eventually be sorted.

A correct approach would involve repeatedly applying the operation until no more splits can be made or checking if the array can be sorted after all possible splits. The current implementation does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after the operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
