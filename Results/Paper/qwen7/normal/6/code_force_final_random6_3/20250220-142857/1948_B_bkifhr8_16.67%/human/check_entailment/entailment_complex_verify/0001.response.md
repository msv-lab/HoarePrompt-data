### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program assumes that performing the operation will always lead to a sorted array, but this is not necessarily true. As demonstrated in the example `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the operations might not result in a sorted array even if the final state is checked.

2. **Lack of Correctness in Logic**: The program only checks if the final array is sorted, which is insufficient. It does not ensure that the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**: There is no mechanism to prevent an infinite loop if the operations do not lead to a sorted array. The program may repeatedly perform the same operations without converging to a sorted state.

However, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect, which is accurate based on the analysis. The program fails to properly handle the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
