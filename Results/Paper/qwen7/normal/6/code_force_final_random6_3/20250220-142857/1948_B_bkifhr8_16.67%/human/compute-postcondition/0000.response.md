Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted version to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length. The new variable `sorted_lst` contains the same integers as `lst`, but they are now sorted in ascending order.
