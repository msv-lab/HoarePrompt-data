Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting the digits of an element when it is greater than 10 is not correctly implemented. The current implementation does not handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits properly. It only checks if an element is greater than 10 and splits it without ensuring the array remains in a state where further operations can sort it.

2. **Function `func_1` Not Used Properly**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used correctly. This function simply checks if the list is sorted, which is not sufficient. The program should attempt to perform the digit-splitting operation and check if the array can be sorted after each operation.

3. **No Attempt to Perform Digit-Splitting Operations**: The program does not attempt to perform the digit-splitting operations iteratively until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Implement the digit-splitting operation correctly.
- Use a loop to repeatedly apply the digit-splitting operation until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.
- Ensure the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Function to split a number into its digits
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]

    # Function to check if the array can be sorted
    def can_sort_array(arr):
        while True:
            sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
            if arr == sorted_arr:
                return True
            for j in range(len(arr)):
                if arr[j] >= 10:
                    arr[j:j+1] = split_number(arr[j])
                    break
            else:
                return False

    if can_sort_array(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version includes the necessary logic to split numbers and check if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.
