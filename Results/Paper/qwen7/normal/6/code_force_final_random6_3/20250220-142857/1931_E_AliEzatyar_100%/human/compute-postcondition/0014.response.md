Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.
   
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is either 1 or 0.
   - `num` is a non-empty string or integer.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

4. **Analyze what happens in the loop**:
   - The loop starts with `i` as `len(num) - 2`.
   - On each iteration, `i` decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `len(num) - 2`, the next value of `i` would be `len(num) - 3`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `counter` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes to `len(num) - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`counter` is either 1 or 0, `num` is a non-empty string or integer, `i` is `len(num) - 3`**.
