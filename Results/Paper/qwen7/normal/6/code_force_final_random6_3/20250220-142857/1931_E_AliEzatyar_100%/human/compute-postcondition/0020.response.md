Output State: **The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of num.**

This is because the loop has already executed all its iterations, setting `counter` to the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `i` being less than or equal to -1 indicates the loop has completed. The return statement will then return the value of `counter`.
