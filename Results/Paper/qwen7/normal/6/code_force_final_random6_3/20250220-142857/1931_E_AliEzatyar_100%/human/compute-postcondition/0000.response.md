Output State: **`counter` is 0, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `counter` to 0. The initial state of `num` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `num` still holds an integer value within the range of 1 to 10^9.
