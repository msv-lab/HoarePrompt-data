Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules described. Specifically, the program does not simulate the game moves accurately. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The program attempts to determine the winner based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, but it does not simulate the actual game moves. The game involves players taking turns to reverse digits and concatenate numbers, respectively, until only one number remains.

2. **Incorrect Functionality**: The `func_1` function counts trailing zeros in a number, but this information is not used correctly in the logic to determine the winner. The program does not simulate the game process where players take turns to reverse digits and concatenate numbers.

3. **No Simulation of Game Moves**: The program does not simulate the game moves where Anna reverses digits and Sasha concatenates numbers. Instead, it makes assumptions about the final state of the list based on the initial number of digits and zeros, which is not a valid approach.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot be considered correct.
