Postcondition: `counter` is either 2 or 1, `num` is a non-empty string or integer, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` becomes either 2 or 1. If `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement while keeping `counter`, `num`, and `i` as initially described.
