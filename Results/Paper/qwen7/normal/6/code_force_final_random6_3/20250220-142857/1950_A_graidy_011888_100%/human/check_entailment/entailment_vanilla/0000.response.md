Let's reason through the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the inputs are treated as integers.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: It then checks if `a < b and b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NONE'.

Now, let's verify if the logic matches the problem statement:

- **Stair Condition**: The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
- **Peak Condition**: The condition `a < b and b > c` correctly identifies a peak.
- **Default Case**: The default case correctly handles all other combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given that the program correctly implements the conditions for a stair and a peak, and handles all other cases appropriately, the program is correct according to the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
