Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the numbers form a stair, a peak, or neither are correctly implemented:
   - `if a < b < c:` checks for a stair.
   - `elif a < b and b > c:` checks for a peak.
   - `else:` handles the case where neither condition is met.
4. The function prints the appropriate string ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each test case.
5. The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the function.

Given the above points, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
