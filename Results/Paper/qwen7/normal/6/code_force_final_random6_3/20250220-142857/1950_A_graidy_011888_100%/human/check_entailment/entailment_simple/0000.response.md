Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR" if true.
4. It checks if the digits form a peak (`a < b and b > c`) and prints "PEAK" if true.
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
6. The conditions for stair and peak are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.
7. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the code that would cause incorrect behavior based on the provided examples.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
