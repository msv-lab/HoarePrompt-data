Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user and their values are updated to the values of the integers entered.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` (either `a < b < c`, `a < b` and `b > c`, or `a >= b` or `b <= c`) still hold based on the user's input.
