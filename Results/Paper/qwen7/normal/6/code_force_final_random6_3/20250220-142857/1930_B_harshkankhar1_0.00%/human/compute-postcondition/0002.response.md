Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, where every second element in `a` is reversed.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(a)` is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - `a` contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Every second element in `a` is reversed.

2. **Example with Specific Values**:
   - Let's take a specific example to illustrate this:
     - Suppose `n = 6` (a small value within the range to make it easier to visualize).
     - The list `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
     - Reversing every second element means:
       - The 2nd element (2) is reversed to 2.
       - The 4th element (4) is reversed to 4.
       - The 6th element (6) is reversed to 6.
     - Thus, the final list `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

3. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will be constructed as follows:
     - The odd-indexed elements remain unchanged.
     - The even-indexed elements remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
In both the specific example and the general case, the list `a` remains unchanged because reversing an already existing number does not change its value. Therefore, the list `a` will contain integers from 1 to `n` in their original order.

### Final Output:
Output: **[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... , n]** (where the list contains integers from 1 to n in their original order).
