Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n, where every second element in `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains integers from 1 to n, after executing the code, the elements at even indices (0-based) will be reversed. For example, if `n` is 5, the list `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and after the code, it becomes `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.
