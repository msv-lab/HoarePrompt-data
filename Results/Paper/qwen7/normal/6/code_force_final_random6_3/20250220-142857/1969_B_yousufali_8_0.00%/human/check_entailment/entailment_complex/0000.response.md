Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` is designed to process a binary string `s` and count the number of segments where there are one or more '1's followed by a '0', plus one additional count for each standalone '1'.
   - However, the function `func_1()` reads from `input()`, which means it expects space-separated integers as input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This mismatch between expected input and actual input makes the function incorrect for the given problem.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly processes the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1()` is incorrect due to reading from `input()` instead of processing a binary string, the overall functionality of `func_2()` is also incorrect.

Given these observations, both functions do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
