Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The given code defines two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function processes a binary string to count the number of segments where there are one or more '1's followed by a '0', plus one additional count for each standalone '1'. However, this function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string using cyclic shifts.
   - `func_2()`: This function processes a specified number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case. It ensures that the variable `t` remains greater than 0, but again, `func_1()` does not solve the problem as intended.

Given the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The provided `func_1()` does not achieve this goal. Instead, it counts segments of '1's followed by '0's plus standalone '1's, which is not relevant to the solution.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
