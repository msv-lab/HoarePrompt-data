Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function `func_1` reads the input as a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. The input should be read as a single string of '0's and '1's, not a list of integers.

2. **Logic for Cyclic Shifts**: The logic implemented in `func_1` does not account for the minimum cost to sort the string through cyclic shifts. It incorrectly calculates the cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's without considering the actual cyclic shift operations needed.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the points where the string needs to be shifted to ensure the sequence is non-decreasing. Specifically, we need to find the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculate the cost based on the remaining unsorted part.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1  # Skip leading zeros
    
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] == '1':
        j += 1  # Find the end of the current segment of '1's
    
    while j < n:
        k = j
        while k < n and s[k] == '1':
            k += 1  # Find the end of the next segment of '1's
        
        if k - j > 0:  # If there is a segment of '1's to shift
            ans += k - j + 1  # Cost is the length of the segment
        
        j = k
        while j < n and s[j] == '0':
            j += 1  # Find the start of the next segment of '0's
    
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version reads the input as a string, identifies segments of '1's and '0's, and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
