Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for every occurrence where `s[i]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, plus the final value of `n` if `s[i]` is 1 at the last iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `s`, and `n` will be the count of 1s in the list `s`.

In simpler terms, `ans` accumulates the count of segments of zeros in the list `s`, adding one to each segment count, and also adds the count of ones in `s` to `ans` at the end.
