### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This means `func_1` is not correctly reading the input as a binary string.
   - It then iterates through the list, counting the number of 1s (`n`) until it encounters a 0. If a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - Specifically, `func_1` does not handle the cyclic shift operations correctly. It simply counts segments of 1s followed by 0s and adds 1 to the count for each such segment, which is not the correct approach to calculating the minimum cost.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the segments of 1s and 0s in the string and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all 1s to the front.
   - For each segment of 0s, we need to consider the cost of shifting the segment of 1s that precede it to the end of the segment of 0s.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code suggests that `func_1` is intended to count segments of 1s followed by 0s and add 1 to the count for each such segment. However, this is not the correct approach to solving the problem.
   - The annotated code also indicates that `func_2` processes multiple test cases, but it relies on `func_1`, which is incorrectly implemented.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. They do not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the binary string.
