Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `i`, which was initially 1. Therefore, `total` becomes 1. The value of `i` is updated to 2 because it is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
