Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Initialization of `values` and `sum_values`:**
   - The program initializes `values` and `sum_values` to be of length `max(numbers) + 1`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. These lists should be initialized to handle all possible digits (0-9) and their cumulative sums.
   
2. **Calculation of `values[i]` for `i` from 10 to `n`:**
   - The logic to calculate `values[i]` for `i` from 10 to `n` is flawed. It incorrectly splits the number into the last digit and the remaining part and tries to add the values of these parts. This approach does not correctly compute the sum of the digits of the number.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to maintain a cumulative sum in `sum_values`, but this is not necessary for solving the problem. Instead, we need to directly compute the sum of the transformed numbers for each test case.

4. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program processes all test cases together and then prints the results. This is incorrect because each test case should be processed independently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This corrected program:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and computes the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. Prints the result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
