Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, an integer `n`. It then initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, both of length 10, filled with zeros. It populates these lists based on the first 10 integers and their cumulative sums. For each integer `n` from 10 to the maximum value in the input list `numbers`, it calculates a new value for `values[n]` using the last digit and the integer formed by the remaining digits. It also updates the `sum_values` list accordingly. Finally, it prints the values from the `sum_values` list corresponding to each integer in the input list `numbers`.**
