Output State: **`total` is 10, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 5, `values[i]` is 5**

Explanation: The value of `total` is incremented by `i`, which was 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
