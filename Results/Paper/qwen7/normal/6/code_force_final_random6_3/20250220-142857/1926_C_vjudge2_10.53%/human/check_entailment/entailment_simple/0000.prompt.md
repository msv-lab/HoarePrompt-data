# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must still be greater than 0 (ensuring the loop ran `t` times), and `numbers` will be a list containing exactly `t` integers, each of which was input by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros (since the loop runs up to 9 times), `sum_values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros, `i` is 11.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs 10 times as specified by the `range(10)` statement. Each iteration sets `values[i]` to `i`, increments `total` by `i`, and updates `sum_values[i]` to the current value of `total`. After 10 iterations, `total` will be the sum of numbers from 0 to 9, which is 45. The variable `i` will be set to 11 after the last iteration since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The lists `values` and `sum_values` are updated according to the loop, but their final lengths and contents are determined by the loop's range, resulting in lists of length 10 filled with values from 0 to 9 for `values` and the cumulative sums from 0 to 45 for `sum_values`.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which is 3 + 3 = 6. The `values` list will have the value 3 at index 21, and the `sum_values` list will have the cumulative sums from 0 to 6 at indices 11 to 21.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list with 10 or more integers, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 12, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6, `sum_values[22]` is 9, `sum_values[23]` is 15, `sum_values[24]` is 21, `sum_values[25]` is 28, `sum_values[26]` is 36, `sum_values[27]` is 45, `values[22]` is 3, `values[23]` is 3, `values[24]` is 3, `values[25]` is 3, `values[26]` is 3, `values[27]` is 3.
    #
    #**Explanation:** After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which accumulates as the loop runs. Each iteration adds the value 3 to `values[i]` and updates `sum_values[i]` accordingly. By the end of the loop, `sum_total` will be 12 (from the initial value of 6 plus the contributions from the next 5 iterations), and `values` and `sum_values` will be updated to reflect these changes up to index 27.
