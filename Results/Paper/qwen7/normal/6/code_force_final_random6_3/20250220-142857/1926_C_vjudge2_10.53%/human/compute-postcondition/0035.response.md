Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 10, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0**

Explanation: The code `sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]` updates the variable `sum_total`. Given that `i` is 10, `values[i]` (which is `values[10]`) is `values[0]` + `values[1]`, and both `values[0]` and `values[1]` are 0, `values[10]` is also 0. Similarly, `sum_values[i - 1]` is `sum_values[9]`, which is 0. Therefore, `sum_total` is 0 + 0, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
