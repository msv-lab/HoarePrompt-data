Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 12, `word` is '12', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 3, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3.**

The code `sum_values[i] = sum_total` updates the value of `sum_values[12]` (since `i` is 12) to be equal to `sum_total`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
