Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 11, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0, `remainder` is 11 // 10**

Explanation: The code `remainder = int(word[:-1])` takes the substring of `word` excluding the last character and converts it to an integer. Since `word` is '11', `word[:-1]` is '1', and `int('1')` is 1. Therefore, `remainder` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
