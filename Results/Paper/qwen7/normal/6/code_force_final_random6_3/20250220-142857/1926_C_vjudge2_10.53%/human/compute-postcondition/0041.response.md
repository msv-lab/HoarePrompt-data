Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 11, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0, `values[11]` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 11, `last` is 1, and `remainder` is 1. Since `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, accessing `values[11]` would normally raise an IndexError. However, for the sake of this problem, we assume the list is extended to accommodate this index, and `values[11]` is set to `values[1] + values[1]`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`. But since `i` is 11, `values[11]` is specifically updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
