Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `range(10)`, which means the loop will run 10 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 9`). This condition does not depend on any other variables like `t`, `numbers`, `values`, or `sum_values`.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`total` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `i` is 0**
