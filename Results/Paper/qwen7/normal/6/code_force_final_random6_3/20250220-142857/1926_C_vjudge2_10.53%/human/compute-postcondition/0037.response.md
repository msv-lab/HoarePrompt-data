Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 45
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers
   - `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros
   - `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros
   - `i` is 10
   - `word` is '10'
   - `last` is 0
   - `remainder` is 1
   - `sum_total` is 0
   - `sum_values[10]` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `10` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at 10 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 10, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to `11`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `11`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` remains 45.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `numbers` remains a list containing `t` integers.
   - `values` remains a list of length 10 filled with zeros.
   - `sum_values` remains a list of length 10 filled with zeros.
   - `i` is now 11.
   - `word` remains '10'.
   - `last` remains 0.
   - `remainder` remains 1.
   - `sum_total` remains 0.
   - `sum_values[10]` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 11, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0**
