Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 11, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` takes the last character of the string `word` (which is '11'), extracts it, and converts it to an integer. Since the last character is '1', `last` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
