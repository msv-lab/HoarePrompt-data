Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `values[0]` is 0**

Explanation: The line `values[i] = i` updates the list `values` by setting its first element (index 0) to the current value of `i`, which is 0. After this assignment, `i` is incremented by 1, so the next time it is used, it will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
