Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer \( n \) (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it constructs and prints a list \( p \) of length \( n \). The elements of \( p \) are filled such that for even indices, \( p[i] = 1 + n \% 2 + 2 \times \text{(number of iterations / 2)} \), and for odd indices, \( p[i] = 1 + n \% 2 + 2 \times \text{((number of iterations + 1) / 2)} \). The function does not return any value but prints the constructed list \( p \) for each test case.**
