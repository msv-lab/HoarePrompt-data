Output State: **`i` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is `ind + 2`, `ind` is `ind + 2`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` updates the value of `p[i]` to be equal to `ind`. The values of `i` and `ind` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `3 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is now `ind + 2`, and `ind` is still `ind + 2`.
