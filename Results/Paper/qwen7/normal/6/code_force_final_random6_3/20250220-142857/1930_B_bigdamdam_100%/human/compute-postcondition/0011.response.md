Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `p` is a list where an element at index `i` is assigned the value `ind`; `ind` is decreased by 2; `i` is incremented by 2**.

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the current value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. The other variables (`n`, `ind`, and `i`) are updated according to their previous states: `ind` is decreased by 2, and `i` is incremented by 2. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
