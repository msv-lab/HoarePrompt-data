Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the input value, which we'll denote as `n`.

2. **Determine the Number of Iterations**: The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the value of `n`. Specifically:
   - If `n` is odd, the loop runs \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) times.
   - If `n` is even, the loop runs \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) times.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop body but changes based on the loop condition. Since the loop runs until `i < n`, `n` does not change during the loop execution.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Example Answer:
Let's assume the initial state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `i` is some value, say `i_prev`.
- `n` is the input value, say `n`.

To find the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` is the same as before.

Since the exact values of `i_prev` and `n` are not provided, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.
