Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` filled with zeros. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `i_prev + 1`, and `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces. The new variable `p` is a list of length `n` with each element set to 0.
