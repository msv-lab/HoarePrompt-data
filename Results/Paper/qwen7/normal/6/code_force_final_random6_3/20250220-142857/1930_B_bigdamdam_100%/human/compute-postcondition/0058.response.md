Output State: **`ind` is 14, `i` is 12, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code initializes `p` as a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`. The values of `ind`, `i`, `p[1]`, `p[4]`, `p[6]`, `p[9]`, and `p[12]` remain unchanged. `n` retains its value as the first integer from the input split by spaces.
