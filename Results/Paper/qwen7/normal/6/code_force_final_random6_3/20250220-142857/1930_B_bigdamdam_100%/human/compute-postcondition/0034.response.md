Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1` and must be an even number within the range [0, n-1]; `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `ind` (which is `n-2`)] at index `i`; `ind` is `n-3`.**

Explanation: The variable `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` was `n-1`. After decrementing, `ind` becomes `n-3`. The other variables (`i` and `p`) remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.
