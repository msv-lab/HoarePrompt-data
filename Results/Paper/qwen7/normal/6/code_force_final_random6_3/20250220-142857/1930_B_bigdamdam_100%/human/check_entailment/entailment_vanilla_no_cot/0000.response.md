Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly generate a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic in the `func` function does not ensure that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (with \(1 \leq i, j < n\); \(i \neq j\)) exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

Let's break down why the current implementation fails:

1. **Odd-Even Assignment**: The code assigns values to the permutation in an alternating manner based on whether the index is even or odd. This approach does not guarantee that the divisibility condition will not hold for any pair of indices.
   
2. **Specific Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case with \(n = 4\). The generated permutation would be `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 3\), which violates the condition.
   - Another example with \(n = 6\) might produce something like `[6, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3]`. Here, \(p_1 = 6\) divides \(p_3 = 4\) and \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 2\), again violating the condition.

To solve this problem correctly, a different strategy is needed. One possible approach is to generate a permutation where elements are placed in a way that avoids the divisibility condition. For instance, one could use a sequence that ensures no two consecutive elements have a divisibility relationship.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that should work:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        # Shuffle the list to avoid simple patterns
        import random
        random.shuffle(p)
        while True:
            valid = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if p[i] % p[i + 1] == 0 or p[i + 1] % p[i] == 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                break
            # If not valid, shuffle again
            random.shuffle(p)
        print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This version shuffles the permutation until a valid one is found, ensuring that no two consecutive elements have a divisibility relationship.
