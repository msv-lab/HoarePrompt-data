Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The key variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 2`
   - `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `n-5`]
   - `ind` is `n-5`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `0` and increments `i` by `2` each time (`range(0, n, 2)`).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `(i_prev + 2) + 2 = i_prev + 4`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i_prev + 4 < n`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i_prev + 4`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `p` and `ind` are not part of the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 4`, `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `n-5`], `ind` is `n-5`**
