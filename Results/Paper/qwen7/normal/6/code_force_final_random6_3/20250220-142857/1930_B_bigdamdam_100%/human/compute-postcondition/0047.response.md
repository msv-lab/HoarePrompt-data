Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches or exceeds `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
   - `i` is 2 (this is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `p[1]` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `n > 2`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `ind` remains 2.
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so it will become 4.
   - `p[1]` remains 1.

5. **Final state**:
   - `ind` is 2
   - `i` is 4
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ind` is 2, `i` is 4, `p[1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than 4**
