Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop runs for \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) times if \( n \) is odd, or \( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \) times if \( n \) is even. After all iterations, `i` will be the last odd number less than `n`, `p[i]` will be assigned the value of `ind`, and `ind` will be incremented by twice the number of iterations.

In more detail, if the loop runs for \( k \) times (where \( k = \frac{n-1}{2} \) if \( n \) is odd, or \( k = \frac{n}{2} - 1 \) if \( n \) is even), then:
- `i` will be the largest odd number less than `n`.
- `p[i]` will be `ind + 2k`.
- `ind` will be `ind + 2k`.

Since `ind` starts as `1 + n % 2` and increases by `2` each iteration, after `k` iterations, `ind` will be `1 + n % 2 + 2k`. Therefore, the final output state is:
- `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`.
- `p[i]` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`.
- `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ind` is 12, `i` is 10, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2, `p[6]` is 4, `p[9]` is 6.

To calculate this, we observe the pattern in the loop:
- The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments by 2 each iteration.
- `ind` starts at 2 and increases by 2 each time it is incremented inside the loop.
- The loop runs until `i` reaches `n`.

From the given information, we can infer that the loop will run until `i` is just below or equal to `n`. If the loop has executed 3 times, then `i` would be 6 (since it increments by 2 each time). Therefore, if the loop runs its full course, `i` would reach the highest odd number less than or equal to `n`.

If the loop runs all iterations, `i` would be `n-1` if `n` is even, or `n-2` if `n` is odd. Given the pattern, if the loop runs 5 times (from 1 to 9), `ind` would be `2 * 5 = 10`, and `i` would be 9. However, since the increment in `i` is by 2, the last value of `i` would be 10 if `n` is 11 (the next odd number after 9).

Thus, after all iterations, `ind` would be `2 * 5 = 10 * 2 / 2 = 12`, `i` would be 10, and `p` would contain the values `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` up to the index where `i` was set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 22, `ind` is 26, `n` is greater than 22, `p[12]` is 19, `p[14]` is 12, `p[16]` is 10, `p[18]` is 20, `p[20]` is 22, `p[22]` is 24.

Explanation: The loop runs for as long as `i` is less than `n` with a step of 2. Given that the loop executes 3 times initially and each iteration increments `i` by 2 and `ind` by 2, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `i` reaches 22 (since it starts from 18 and increments by 2 each time). At this point, `ind` would have been incremented 7 times starting from 20 (as it was 20 after the 3rd iteration), making it 26. Therefore, `p[i]` will be assigned the value of `ind` at each even index starting from 12 up to 22, resulting in the specified values for `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
