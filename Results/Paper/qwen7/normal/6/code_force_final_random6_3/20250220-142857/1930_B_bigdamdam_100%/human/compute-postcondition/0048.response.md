Output State: **`ind` is 2, `i` is 4, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` with the value of `ind`. Given that `i` is 4 and `ind` is 2, `p[4]` is set to 2. The values of `ind`, `i`, and `p[1]` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
