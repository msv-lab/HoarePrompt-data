Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the length of the required permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two loops to fill the list `p`:
     - The first loop (`for i in range(0, n, 2):`) fills even indices of `p` with decreasing values starting from `ind = n`.
     - The second loop (`for i in range(1, n, 2):`) fills odd indices of `p` with increasing values starting from `ind = 1 + n % 2`.

3. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, the program prints the permutation using `print(*p)`.

### Verification:

#### Example Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  4
  3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  4 1 2 3
  1 2 3
  ```

- **Program Execution:**
  - For `n = 4`:
    - Even indices: `p[0] = 4`, `p[2] = 2`
    - Odd indices: `p[1] = 1`, `p[3] = 3`
    - Result: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
  - For `n = 3`:
    - Even index: `p[0] = 3`
    - Odd indices: `p[1] = 1`, `p[2] = 2`
    - Result: `[3, 1, 2]`

### Checking the Constraints:
- The constructed permutations `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 1, 2]` are valid because no pair of indices `(i, j)` exists such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.

### Conclusion:
The given program constructs a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
