Output State: **`i` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is `ind + 2`, `ind` is `ind + 4`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is set to `3 + n % 2`. The value of `p[i]` is `ind + 2`, and `ind` is `ind + 2`. After executing `ind += 2`, the value of `ind` is updated to its current value plus 2. Since the initial value of `ind` was `ind + 2`, the new value of `ind` becomes `ind + 4`. The values of `i` and `p[i]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
