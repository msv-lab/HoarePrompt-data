Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts, which is based on the length of the substring being shifted.

For example, consider the input `101011`. The program will incorrectly calculate the cost without considering the length of the substring being shifted. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of why the program fails:

1. The program counts the number of zeros in the string but does not use this information correctly to calculate the cost.
2. It iterates through the string and increments a counter `ans` based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not reflect the actual cost of cyclic shifts.

To illustrate, let’s manually calculate the minimum cost for `101011`:
- We can perform the following operations:
  1. Shift the substring `[3, 5]`: `101011` -> `101101` (cost = 3)
  2. Shift the substring `[4, 6]`: `101101` -> `110101` (cost = 3)
  3. Shift the substring `[5, 6]`: `110101` -> `110110` (cost = 2)
  4. Shift the substring `[6, 6]`: `110110` -> `110110` (cost = 1)

Total cost = 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9

However, the program would not correctly compute this cost because it does not properly account for the length of the substring being shifted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
