Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will be the total number of positions in the list `s` where the count of 0s is less than or equal to the count of 1s, plus the number of zeros in the list `s` minus the count of zeros encountered so far for each non-zero element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `cnt` is [final_count_of_1s, final_count_of_2s], `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the entire list `s`, `ans` is the final value calculated based on the conditions given in the loop, `s` is the list of integers that has been fully iterated over, and `c` is the last element of `s`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will contain the counts of each integer present in the list `s`, specifically the count of 1s and 2s (assuming no other integers are present as per the provided loop logic). The variable `zeroes` will hold the total count of 0s in the list `s`. The variable `ans` will be the final value calculated according to the conditions inside the loop for every element in `s`. This value of `ans` is determined by incrementing it based on whether the current element `c` is 0 and the count of 1s seen so far (`cnt[1]`), or by subtracting the count of 0s seen so far (`cnt[0]`) from `zeroes` if `c` is not 0. The list `s` will have been fully processed, and `c` will be the last element of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `s` have been processed, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` hold the counts of 0s and 1s in `s`, respectively, `ans` is the sum of 1s in `s` plus the maximum difference between the number of zeroes and the count of 0s encountered so far for each element in `s` that is not 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
