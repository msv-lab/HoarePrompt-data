Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0. This updates the value of `c`, but does not affect the values of `maxi`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `ele`. The precondition that `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi` remains valid since `c` was just set to 0 and no comparison was made to update `maxi`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
