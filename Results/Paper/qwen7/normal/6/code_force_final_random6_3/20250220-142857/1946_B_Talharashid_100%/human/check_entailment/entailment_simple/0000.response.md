### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the sum of the array.
   - The optimal strategy is to use the largest positive elements and sums of subarrays to maximize the sum.
   - The code logic correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) and uses it in the calculation.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through each test case.
   - It calculates the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) using Kadane's algorithm-like approach.
   - It then computes the final result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This part accounts for the effect of inserting the maximum subarray sum multiple times.
   - `- maxi`: This adjusts the sum to avoid double-counting the maximum subarray sum.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the original sum of the array.
   - `% 1000000007`: This ensures the result fits within the required modulo.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers correctly by resetting `c` when encountering a negative number whose absolute value is less than or equal to `c`.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result is within the required bounds.

6. **Loop and Variable Management**:
   - The loop correctly processes each test case independently.
   - Variables like `n`, `k`, and `l` are reset appropriately for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
