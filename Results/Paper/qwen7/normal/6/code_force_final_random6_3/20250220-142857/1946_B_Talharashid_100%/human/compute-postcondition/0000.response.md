Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key objects here are:
   - `i`: This variable will take on values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - `input()`: This function call reads an input from the user, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` will iterate from 0 up to `int(input()) - 1`, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` itself does not need to be explicitly set; it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1. Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can assume that `t` is the expected input value for `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be at least 1**
