Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between the sum of contiguous subarray elements in `l` that meet specific conditions and any individual element in `l` that is less than 0 and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`. This maximum value is then multiplied by \(2^k\), adjusted by subtracting `maxi` and adding the sum of all elements in `l`, and finally taken modulo \(1000000007\). The function returns this computed value after processing all test cases.**
