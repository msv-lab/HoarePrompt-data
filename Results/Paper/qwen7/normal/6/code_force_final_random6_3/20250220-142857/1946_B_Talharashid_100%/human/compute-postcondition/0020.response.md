Postcondition: `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the absolute value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of `c` and the second element of `l`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `maxi` and the second element of `l`.
