Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is `c + ele`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi` if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c + 2*ele` and `maxi`.
