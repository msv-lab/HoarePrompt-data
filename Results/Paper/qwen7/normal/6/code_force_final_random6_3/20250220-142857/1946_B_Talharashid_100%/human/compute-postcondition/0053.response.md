Postcondition: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**
