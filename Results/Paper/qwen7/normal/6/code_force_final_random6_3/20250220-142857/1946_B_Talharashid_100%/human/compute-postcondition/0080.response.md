Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is `c + 2*ele`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` is now updated to `c + ele`, which can also be expressed as `c + 2*ele` given the initial state where `c` was already equal to `c + ele`.
