Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, `maxi` is also updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: Initially, `maxi` is defined as the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, and it is also updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. After executing `c = 0`, the value of `c` is set to 0. Since `c` is now 0, the value of `maxi` remains unchanged because both conditions (`c + ele` and `c`) are dependent on `c`, which is now 0. Therefore, `maxi` retains its initial definition and update.
