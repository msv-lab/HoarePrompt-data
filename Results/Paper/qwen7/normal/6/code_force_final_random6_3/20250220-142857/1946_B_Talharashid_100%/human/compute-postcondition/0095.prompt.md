Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will hold the maximum sum of contiguous subarray elements in the list `l` that meets the condition specified in the loop, and `maxi` will be the maximum value between `c` and any individual element in `l` that is less than 0 and whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`. `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `i` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `c` is the last value it was updated to, `l` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is the maximum value between c and maxi, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the second input string and converting each element to an integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
