Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0; `c` is increased by `ele`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. The value of `maxi` remains the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, as no operation directly affects `maxi`. Therefore, the updated state includes `c` being increased by `ele` and `maxi` remaining as the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.
