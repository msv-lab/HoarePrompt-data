Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
   - `i` is the length of the list `l`.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `k` is the input integer.
   - `c` is the last value it was updated to.
   - `l` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of `int(input())`. This means `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `int(input())`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop runs based on `i`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `i` should be `int(input()) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `int(input())`.

5. **Adjust other states**:
   - `maxi`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `l` are not directly affected by the loop itself and remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` should be `int(input())` (since it was `int(input()) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
- All other variables (`maxi`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `l`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `i` is `int(input())`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `c` is the last value it was updated to, `l` is an empty list**.
