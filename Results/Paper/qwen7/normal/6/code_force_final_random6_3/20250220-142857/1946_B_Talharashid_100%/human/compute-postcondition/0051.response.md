Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, `i` is incremented by 1 (now `i` is `i_val + 1`), `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c += ele` updates the variable `c` by adding the value of `ele` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i_val + 1`. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain as they were after the input was processed.
