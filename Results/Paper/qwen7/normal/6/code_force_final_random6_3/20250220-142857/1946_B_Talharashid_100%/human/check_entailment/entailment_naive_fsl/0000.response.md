Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum and then calculates the result using the formula \(2^k \times \text{max\_subarray\_sum} - \text{max\_subarray\_sum} + \text{sum\_of\_array}\). However, this approach is flawed.

The correct approach to maximize the sum of the array after performing \(k\) operations is to consider the following:

1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Find the maximum subarray sum.
3. Use the maximum subarray sum to maximize the overall sum after \(k\) operations.

The program incorrectly calculates the maximum subarray sum using a simple loop that does not handle the full Kadane's algorithm logic. Additionally, the formula used in the program is incorrect. The correct formula to calculate the maximum possible sum after \(k\) operations is:

\[ \text{max\_sum} = (\text{sum\_of\_array} + (2^k - 1) \times \text{max\_subarray\_sum}) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        current_max = max_sum = arr[0]
        for num in arr[1:]:
            current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_max)
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations
        max_sum = (total_sum + (pow(2, k, MOD) - 1) * max_sum) % MOD
        
        print(max_sum)

func()
```

This corrected program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and applies the correct formula to compute the maximum possible sum after \(k\) operations.
