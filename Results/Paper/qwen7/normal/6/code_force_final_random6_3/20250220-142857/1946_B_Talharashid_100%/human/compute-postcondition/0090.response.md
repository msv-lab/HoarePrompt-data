Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, `c` is updated based on the next `ele` in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
