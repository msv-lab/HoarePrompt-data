Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the first element of `l`, `c` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Since `c` is initially `c + ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`. The list `l` and its first element `ele` remain unchanged.
