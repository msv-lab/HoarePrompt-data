Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `l`.**

Explanation: The line `c = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `c`. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
