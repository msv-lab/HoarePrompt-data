Output State: **`maxi` is max(0, c), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element, the current value of `ele` is less than 0, and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The line `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. This updates the value of `c` but does not affect any other variables or conditions. Therefore, the other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
