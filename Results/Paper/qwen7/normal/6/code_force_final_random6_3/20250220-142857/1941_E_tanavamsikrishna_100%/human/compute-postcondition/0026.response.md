Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. This means the loop continues as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `d-1`
   - `d` must be greater than 1
   - `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`
   - `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the second element is `-2` or less

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must hold true.
   - Given `i = d-1`, the condition becomes `[e[1]] <= (d-1) - (d + 2)`, which simplifies to `[e[1]] <= -2`.
   - Since `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the second element is `-2` or less, and this condition must still hold for the next iteration, we need to ensure that the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is still `-2` or less.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is already `d-1`.
   - The state of `d` does not need to be adjusted because it is already known to be greater than 1.
   - The state of `len(row)` does not need to be adjusted because it is already known to be greater than `d-1`.
   - The state of `min_heap` must ensure that it still contains a tuple where the second element is `-2` or less for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `min_heap` still contains a tuple where the second element is `-2` or less.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the second element is `-2` or less**
