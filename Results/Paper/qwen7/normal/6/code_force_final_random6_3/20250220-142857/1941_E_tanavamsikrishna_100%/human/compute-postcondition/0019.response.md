Output State: `i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` must be empty.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition inside the while loop (`e := heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d + 2)`) will no longer be satisfied because `min_heap` will be empty. This means that the loop terminates when there are no more elements in `min_heap` that meet the condition. Therefore, the final state of `min_heap` will be empty, while the other variables (`i`, `d`, and `len(row)`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
