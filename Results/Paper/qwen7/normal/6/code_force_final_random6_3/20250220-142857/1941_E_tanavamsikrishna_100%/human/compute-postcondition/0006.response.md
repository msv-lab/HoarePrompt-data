Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

5. **Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 0.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.
   - The condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The state of `total_costs` does not change within the loop head, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list, `i` is 1**.
