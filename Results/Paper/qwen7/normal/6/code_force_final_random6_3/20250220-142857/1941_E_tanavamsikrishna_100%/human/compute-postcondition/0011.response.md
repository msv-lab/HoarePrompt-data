Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list, starting from the beginning and moving through the list until the end. The final value of `i` is `len(costs) - k`.

To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of all possible consecutive sublists of length `k` from the original `costs` list. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = len(costs) - k`, appending the sum of each sublist of length `k` starting at index `i` to `total_costs`. Therefore, the final `total_costs` will include the sum of every possible `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
