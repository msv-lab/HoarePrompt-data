Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))` will generate numbers starting from 0 up to `len(costs) - k`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Therefore, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Adjust the state of `costs` and `k`**: For the loop to execute, the list `costs` must contain enough elements such that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is a positive number. This ensures that there are valid values for `i` to iterate through.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `costs` has at least `k` elements, so that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is a positive number.

State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, costs is a list that must have at least k elements, i is 0**
