Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1`; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the elements in the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k - 1` to the `total_costs` list. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2 (since the slice operation `costs[i:i + k]` starts from index `i` and goes up to `i + k - 1`). The `total_costs` list now includes the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the new sum calculated from index `i` to `i + k - 1`.
