Let's break down the solution step by step to verify its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of 1 and 2 respectively.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, it ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row of the river to get the minimum cost of placing supports in each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Verification of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - The logic for updating the cost of placing supports ensures that the distance condition is met.
   - The function correctly returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

4. **Verification of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input for a single test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports.
   - It calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - The function correctly prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of placing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended and handle the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
