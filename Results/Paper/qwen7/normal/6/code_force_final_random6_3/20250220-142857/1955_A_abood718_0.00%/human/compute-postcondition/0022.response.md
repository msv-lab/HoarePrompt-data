Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1. This does not affect the variables `A'`, `B'`, `C'`, or `X` directly, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

2. `A'` is defined as an integer input. This means `A'` is a specific integer value provided by the user.

3. `B'` is defined as another integer input. Similar to `A'`, this is also a specific integer value provided by the user.

4. `C'` is defined as yet another integer input. Again, this is a specific integer value provided by the user.

5. `X` is defined as `A'` divided by 2. Since `A'` is an integer, dividing it by 2 will result in either an integer or a float, depending on whether `A'` is even or odd.

6. The `print(X)` statement will print the value of `X`.

Given the above, the output will be the value of `X`, which is `A'` divided by 2.

Output: **X (where X is A' / 2, with A' being an integer input)**
