Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `A` is the first integer entered.
- `B` is the second integer entered.
- `C` is the third integer entered.
- The condition `B * 2 < C` holds true.
- `X` is `A // 2`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(X * C + B)`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
2. The expression `X * C + B` will be evaluated with the values of `X`, `C`, and `B`.
3. Since `B * 2 < C`, `C` is greater than `B * 2`.

Therefore, the expression `X * C + B` will be computed as follows:
- `X = A // 2`
- `X * C` will be the product of `A // 2` and `C`.
- Adding `B` to this product gives `X * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
