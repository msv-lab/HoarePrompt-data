Given the initial state where `i` is incremented by 1, `A'` is replaced by an integer input, `B'` is replaced by an integer input, and `C'` is replaced by an integer input, we need to determine the value of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`.

- `A'` is an integer input, so let's denote it as `A`.
- `C'` is an integer input, so let's denote it as `C`.

The expression `int(A * C / 2)` will take the integer value of `A`, multiply it by the integer value of `C`, divide the result by 2, and then convert the result to an integer (which, in Python, simply truncates the decimal part).

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not specified, we will represent them as generic integer inputs.

Output: **int(A * C / 2)**
