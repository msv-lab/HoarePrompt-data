Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will reflect the values entered during the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, if the condition `B * 2 < C` was met during the last iteration, `A` remains unchanged. If `B * 2 \geq C` during the last iteration, and if `A` was even, it remains unchanged; if `A` was odd, it would have been halved (`A // 2`). The output of the loop during the last iteration (either `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X` followed by `X * C + B`) will be printed.

In summary, the final values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are those provided as input in the last iteration of the loop, and the loop's output will be based on the conditions evaluated with these final values.
