Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `A` is an input integer
- `B` is an input integer
- `C` is an input integer

The print statement is:

```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Here, the expression `A * C / 2` is evaluated and then converted to an integer using the `int()` function. Since `A` and `C` are input integers, their product divided by 2 and then converted to an integer will be the value printed.

Output: **int(A * C / 2)**
