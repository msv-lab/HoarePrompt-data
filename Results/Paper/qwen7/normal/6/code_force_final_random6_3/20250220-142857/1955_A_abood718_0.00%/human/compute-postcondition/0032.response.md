Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `A` is an input integer, `B` is an input integer, `C` is an input integer, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 (using integer division) to the variable `X`. The values of `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states.
