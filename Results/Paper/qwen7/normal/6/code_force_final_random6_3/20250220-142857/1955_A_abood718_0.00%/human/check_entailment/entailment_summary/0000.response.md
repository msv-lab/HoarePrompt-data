Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the first condition where \(B \times 2 < C\). In this case, it prints \(A \times B\), which is the correct cost when buying each yogurt individually.
2. For the second condition where \(A\) is even, the program prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\), which is also correct because buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price would be cheaper.
3. However, the logic for the third condition (when \(A\) is odd) is incorrect. The program prints \(\frac{A}{2}\) and then prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). This does not necessarily give the minimum cost. Instead, the correct approach should be to buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurts individually or in pairs if they form another pair.

To illustrate the error:
- For the input \(3, 5, 11\):
  - The program incorrectly prints `1` and then `11`, resulting in a total of \(1 + 11 = 12\).
  - The correct approach would be to buy 1 pair of yogurts for 11 burles and 1 individual yogurt for 5 burles, resulting in a total of \(11 + 5 = 16\).

Given this analysis, the program's logic for handling the case where \(A\) is odd is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
