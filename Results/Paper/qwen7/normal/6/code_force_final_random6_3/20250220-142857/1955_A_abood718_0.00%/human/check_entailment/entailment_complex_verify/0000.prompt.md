You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, so the variable `i` will be equal to `t`. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will be the values of the last input set during the loop's final iteration. If the condition `B * 2 < C` was met for the last iteration, and `A` was odd, `X` will be set to `A // 2` and printed. Otherwise, `X` will not be defined or will remain from previous iterations if it was printed before. All other variables and their states will remain as they were in the initial or previous states within the loop, unaffected by the loop's completion.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` will be the values from the last input, and `X` (if printed) will be the result of the last odd `A` division by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). It prints a result based on specific conditions involving these integers. Specifically, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). If \(A\) is odd, it calculates \(\frac{A}{2}\), prints it, and then prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) from the last test case, along with any previously printed intermediate results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the case where `n` is odd and `B * 2 >= C`. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) instead of calculating the cost as `X * C + B`.

For example, if `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`, the correct output should be `15` (since it's cheaper to buy 2 yogurts for 11 burles and 1 yogurt for 5 burles). However, the program prints `3` because it calculates `X = 3 // 2 = 1` and then prints `X` without adding the remaining yogurt's price.

To fix this, the program should correctly handle the case where `A % 2 != 0` by ensuring it adds the price of the last yogurt after calculating the cost of the pairs.
