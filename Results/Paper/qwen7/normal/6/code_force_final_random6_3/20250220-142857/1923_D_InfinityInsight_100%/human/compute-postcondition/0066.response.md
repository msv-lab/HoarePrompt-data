Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`.
   - `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`.
   - `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 4 (since `i` is now 4).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Keep other states unchanged**: The values of `x`, `inx`, and `ans[i]` are derived from the loop body and are not directly affected by the loop condition.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`, `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`**.
