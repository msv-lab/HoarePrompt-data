Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` should be set to 1 (the starting point of the range).

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts at `i = 1` and goes up to but does not include `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `left` is a list containing 0.
   - `last` is a list containing -1.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing `-1`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**.
