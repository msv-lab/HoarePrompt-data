Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` has one fewer element than it had before, `last` is an appropriately initialized list, `left` is a list with its last element updated to `left[-1] + i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `left[-1] + i` to the list `left`. Here, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, and `left[-1]` is the last element of the list `left` before the append operation. After appending, the last element of `left` becomes `left[-1] + i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
