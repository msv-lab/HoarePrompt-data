Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic in the program assumes that the distance between any two points will give the side length of the square, which is incorrect. The program calculates the squared distance between pairs of points and prints the minimum value, which may not correspond to the side length of the square.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())

        # Calculate differences in x and y coordinates
        x_diffs = [abs(a - c), abs(a - e), abs(a - g), abs(c - e), abs(c - g), abs(e - g)]
        y_diffs = [abs(b - d), abs(b - f), abs(b - h), abs(d - f), abs(d - h), abs(f - h)]

        # Find the maximum difference in x and y coordinates
        max_x_diff = max(x_diffs)
        max_y_diff = max(y_diffs)

        # The side length of the square is the maximum of these differences
        side_length = max(max_x_diff, max_y_diff)

        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected program identifies the side length of the square by finding the maximum difference in x and y coordinates and then calculates the area correctly.
