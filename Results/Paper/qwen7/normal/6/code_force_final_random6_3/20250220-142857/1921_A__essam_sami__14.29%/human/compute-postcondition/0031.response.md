Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 3 (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are specific integers where `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, and `f` is the fourth integer entered.
- `g` and `h` are the first and second integers from input split.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(x)
```

Here, `x` is the value of \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).

Therefore, the output will be the value of \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).

Output: **(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2**
