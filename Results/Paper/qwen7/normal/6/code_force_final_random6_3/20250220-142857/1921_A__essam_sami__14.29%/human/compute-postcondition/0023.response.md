Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `steps` and `t`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `steps` is less than `t`.
3. **Determine the State After One Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and `steps` is 2.
   - Since `steps` is 2, the loop will run one more time if `t` is greater than 2.

Given this information, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `t` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous state).
- `steps` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value of 2, so it will become 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3**
