Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `e` and `f`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the order of input are preserved. Therefore, `c` and `d` remain as the first and second integers entered, while `e` and `f` are the third and fourth integers entered respectively.
