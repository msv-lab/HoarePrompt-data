Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for steps in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `steps` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `steps` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `steps < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `steps` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `steps` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `steps` will become 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: After the next iteration, the state should reflect the updated values of `steps` and `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 2**
