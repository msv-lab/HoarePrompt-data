Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered, `g` is the first integer from input split, `h` is the second integer from input split, `n` is (a - e)² + (b - f)², `x` is (c - g)² + (d - h)². If `x > n`, then nothing specific changes. Otherwise, nothing specific changes.**
