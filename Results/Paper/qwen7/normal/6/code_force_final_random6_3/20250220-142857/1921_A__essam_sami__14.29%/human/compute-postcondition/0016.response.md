Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 2; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer; `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `e` and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged.
