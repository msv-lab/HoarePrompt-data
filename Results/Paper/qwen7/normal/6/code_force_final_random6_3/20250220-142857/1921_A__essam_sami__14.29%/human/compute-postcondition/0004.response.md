Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from the input split; `f` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `e` and `f` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged.
