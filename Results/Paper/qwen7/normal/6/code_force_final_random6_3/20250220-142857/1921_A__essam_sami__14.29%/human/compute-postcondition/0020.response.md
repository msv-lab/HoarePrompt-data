Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 2 (though `steps` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers (their values are not specified but they are used in the calculation of `n`).
- `c` and `d` are the first and second integers entered (these are used to calculate `x` but not `n`).
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from input split and converted to integers (these are used to calculate `n`).
- `g` and `h` are the first and second integers from input split and converted to integers (these are used to calculate `x` but not `n`).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\) (though `x` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

The print statement `print(n)` will print the value of `n`, which is the Euclidean distance squared between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.

Output: **(a - e)² + (b - f)²**
