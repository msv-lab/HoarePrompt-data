Output State: **`C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as no other operations were performed on them.
