Postcondition: `C[in_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` are integers. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is equal to `C[in_aa]`, and if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then either `E[out_aa]` is greater than -1 or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1. If `C[in_aa]` does not equal `D[in_aa]`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, and `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0.
