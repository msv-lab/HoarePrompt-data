Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All elements in `D` are set to zero, `C` is empty, `tot` is 0, `fnd` is the total number of times the loop executed if `sum(D.values())` was greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration, otherwise `fnd` is the total number of iterations executed.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since the loop modifies `D` by decrementing its values and `C` by incrementing its values under certain conditions, eventually all values in `D` will be decremented to zero. Once `D` is empty, no further changes can occur to `tot` which is the sum of `D.values()`. The variable `fnd` keeps track of the number of times the condition `tot >= k` is met and increments accordingly. Therefore, `fnd` will be the total number of iterations where the condition was satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `tot` (the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`. After all iterations, `fnd` will be the total number of such iterations. `tot` will be the final sum of the values in `D` after all iterations have completed. The counters `C` and `E` will reflect the changes made within the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, `C` will show how many times each key's count in `D` matched exactly with its count in `cnt_aa`, and `E` will show the remaining differences after adjustments in `D`.

The state of `bb`, `cnt_aa`, and `cnt_bb` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `D` are zero, `E` contains all unique elements from `aa[:n-m]` that are not in `D`, `C` contains all unique elements from `bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop executions, `tot` is zero, and `nabors` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
