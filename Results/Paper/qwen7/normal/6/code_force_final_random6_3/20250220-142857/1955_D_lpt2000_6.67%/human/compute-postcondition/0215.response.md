Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `out_aa` is decremented by 1 in `aa[:n - m]`; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, with `in_aa` being the next element in `aa[m:]` and `out_aa` being the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.
