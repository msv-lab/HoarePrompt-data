Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is decremented by 1 in `aa[:n - m]`**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `out_aa` by 1. The other variables (`fnd`, `in_aa`, and `tot`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
