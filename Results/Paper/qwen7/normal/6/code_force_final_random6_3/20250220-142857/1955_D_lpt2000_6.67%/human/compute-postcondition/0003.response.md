Output State: **`nabors` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation: The code `aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `aa`. The initial conditions for `nabors`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
