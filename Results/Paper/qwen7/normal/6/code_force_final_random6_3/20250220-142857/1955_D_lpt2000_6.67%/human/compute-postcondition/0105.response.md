Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and either `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0 but is now less than its original value, or `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, then `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, the value of `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
