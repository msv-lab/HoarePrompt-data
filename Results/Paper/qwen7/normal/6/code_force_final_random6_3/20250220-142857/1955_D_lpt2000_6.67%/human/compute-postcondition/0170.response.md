Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and remains greater than 0; `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0; `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element; `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element.**

This means that `D[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1 but still remains greater than 0. The conditions for `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` are still met, and the values of `E[out_aa]`, `aa[m:]`, `aa[:n - m]`, and `D[out_aa]` are as described.
