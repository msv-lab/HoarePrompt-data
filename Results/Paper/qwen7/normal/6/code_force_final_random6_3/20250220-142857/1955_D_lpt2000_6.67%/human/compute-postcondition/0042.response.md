Postcondition: `m` is less than the length of `aa`, `n` is greater than `m`. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `C[in_aa] + 1` or greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is either not decreased by 1 or is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is either not decreased by 1 or is decreased by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`.
