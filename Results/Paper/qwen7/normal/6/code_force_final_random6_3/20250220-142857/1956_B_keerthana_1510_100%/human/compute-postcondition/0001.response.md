Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The loop is about to start reading the third line and subsequent lines.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

   Here, `line` refers to the current line being read by the loop. The expression inside the `print` function does the following:
   - `line.split()` splits the line into tokens (words or other substrings separated by whitespace).
   - `tokens := line.split()` assigns the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens` and returns the same value.
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the line.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the tokens, removing any duplicates.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the line.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the number of duplicate tokens in the line.

Given this, the `print` statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the current line being read.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the current line (where the number of duplicate tokens is the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in the current line)**
