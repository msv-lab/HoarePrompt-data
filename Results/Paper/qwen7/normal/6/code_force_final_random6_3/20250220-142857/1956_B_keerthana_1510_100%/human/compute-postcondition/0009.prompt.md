You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the loop has executed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) such that each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given sequence.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
