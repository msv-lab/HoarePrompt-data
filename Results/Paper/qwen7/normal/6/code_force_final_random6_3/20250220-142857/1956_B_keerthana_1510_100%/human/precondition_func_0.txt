t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
