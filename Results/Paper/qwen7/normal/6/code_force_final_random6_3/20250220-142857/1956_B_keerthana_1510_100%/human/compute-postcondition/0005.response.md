Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The loop is about to read the seventh line, meaning `line` is the content of the seventh line of input.

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `line.split()` splits the line into tokens (words or substrings).
2. `tokens := line.split()` assigns the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens`.
3. `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the line.
4. `{*tokens}` creates a set from the tokens, removing any duplicates.
5. `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the line.
6. The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the number of duplicate tokens in the line.

Since the exact content of the seventh line (`line`) is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of duplicate tokens. However, we can describe the general form of the output.

Output: **len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) (where tokens is the result of splitting the seventh line into words and len({*tokens}) is the count of unique tokens in those words)**
