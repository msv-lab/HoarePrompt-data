Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program reads input from standard input and processes it, but its logic is incorrect for calculating the maximum number of points you can get.

The program attempts to calculate the number of unique tokens in a line of space-separated integers, which is not relevant to the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the distribution of cards between you and Nene, nor does it simulate the turns and scoring mechanism described in the problem statement.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to:
1. Understand the distribution of cards between you and Nene.
2. Simulate the turns where you and Nene take turns placing cards on the table.
3. Calculate the maximum points you can get by considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

The given program fails to address these requirements and thus is incorrect.
