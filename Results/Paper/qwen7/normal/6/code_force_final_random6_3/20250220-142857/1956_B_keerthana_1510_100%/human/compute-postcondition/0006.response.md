Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the loop has completed all its iterations. After processing all the test cases, the loop is no longer executing any further lines.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 10,000, and `n` will still be within the range of 1 to 200,000. However, the loop itself will have processed all the input lines and will not be running anymore.
