Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The loop is about to start reading the fifth line and subsequent lines.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `line.split()` splits the current line into tokens (words or other delimited parts).
   - `tokens := line.split()` assigns the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens` and also returns it.
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the line.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the tokens, removing any duplicates.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the line.
   - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the number of duplicate tokens in the line.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact content of the line (`line`) is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of duplicate tokens. However, the expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` will always return the count of duplicate tokens in the line.

Given this, the output will be the count of duplicate tokens in the line that the loop is currently processing.

Output: **the number of duplicate tokens in the line (where the line is the current line being read by the loop)**
