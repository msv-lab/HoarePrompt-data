You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the first and last elements, reducing `k` based on their minimum value, and updating the count of times the last element (`b`) was found to be non-positive. If `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`, the function returns the count of non-positive `b` values plus one. If no operations were performed, it returns zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a sequence of ships with varying durability. The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately, reducing their durability by 1 each time until they sink. The goal is to count the number of ships that sink after `k` attacks.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`T`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships (`n`), the number of attacks (`k`), and the durability of each ship (`nums`).
   - It uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends of the list, which is crucial for alternating between the first and last ships.
   - The function `func_1` simulates the attacks:
     - It initializes the durability values in a deque and sets the answer (`ans`) to 0.
     - It enters a loop where it continues attacking as long as there are at least two ships left and there are still attacks remaining (`k`).
     - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (`a` and `b`), finds the minimum durability (`x`), and reduces the durability of both ships by `x`.
     - If the total reduction in durability (`2 * x`) is less than or equal to `k`, it applies this reduction and updates `k`. Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
     - After each attack, it checks if the durability of the first or last ship is greater than 0. If so, it appends the non-zero durability back to the deque. If the durability is 0, it increments the answer (`ans`).
     - After the main loop, if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked (`k >= nums[0]`), it increments the answer by 1.
   - Finally, it returns the answer.

3. **Checking for Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the alternating attacks and the conditions for sinking ships appears to be correctly implemented.
   - The use of a deque allows efficient popping from both ends, which is necessary for the alternating attack pattern.
   - The code handles the edge cases where a ship sinks and stops being attacked properly.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to simulate the attacks and count the number of ships that sink.

Correctness: **True**
