Postcondition: `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each decreased by `x`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`.
