    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Each iteration reduces `k` by a value depending on the minimum of the first and last elements of `nums`, and updates `nums` accordingly. Once `k` becomes zero or `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop terminates. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times `b` (the last element of `nums` before it is possibly appended back) was found to be non-positive, which happens when `b` is reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. Since the loop ends when `k` is 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `k` will be 0 and `nums` will be an empty deque by the end of all iterations.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, and the length of `nums` is at least 2
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is currently 0 since no operations have been performed to change its value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\)), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the first and last elements, reducing `k` based on their minimum value, and updating the count of times the last element (`b`) was found to be non-positive. If `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`, the function returns the count of non-positive `b` values plus one. If no operations were performed, it returns zero.
