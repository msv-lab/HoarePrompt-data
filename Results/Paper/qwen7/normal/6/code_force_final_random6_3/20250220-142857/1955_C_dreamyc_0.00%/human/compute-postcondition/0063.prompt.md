Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-zero integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque after appending, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b > 0` and `a > 0` and `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times x\), `k` is decreased by \(2 \times x\) and `b` is decreased by `x`. If `b > 0` and `a > 0` and `k` is less than \(2 \times x\), `k` remains unchanged. If `b > 0` and `a` is not greater than 0, `ans` is set to 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `ans` is either unchanged or increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 times `x`, and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements. If `b > 0`, then `k` remains unchanged, and `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `b`. If `b <= 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `b`. If `b <= 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
