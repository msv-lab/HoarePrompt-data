Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `nums = deque(nums)` converts the list `nums` into a deque (double-ended queue). This changes the data structure of `nums` from a list to a deque, but does not alter the values or the number of elements in `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
