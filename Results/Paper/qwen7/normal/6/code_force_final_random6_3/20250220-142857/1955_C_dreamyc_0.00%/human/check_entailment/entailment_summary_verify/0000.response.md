### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description vs. Program Behavior:
1. **Problem Description**: The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships. This means in each step, either the first or the last ship is attacked, and the process continues until all ships sink or `k` attacks are exhausted.
2. **Program Behavior**: The program uses a `deque` to manage the ships' durabilities and alternates between attacking the first and last ships. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the alternating pattern. Specifically, the program attempts to reduce the durabilities of both the first and last ships simultaneously in each iteration, which is not consistent with the problem description.

#### Function Summary vs. Program Behavior:
1. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the first and last elements, reducing `k` based on their minimum value, and updating the count of times the last element (`b`) was found to be non-positive. If `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`, the function returns the count of non-positive `b` values plus one. If no operations were performed, it returns zero.
2. **Program Behavior**: The program indeed removes the first and last elements in each iteration and updates the count of non-positive `b` values, but it does not correctly alternate between attacking the first and last ships. Instead, it reduces the durabilities of both ships in each iteration, which is incorrect.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- `n = 4`, `k = 5`
- Durabilities: `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`

According to the problem description:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and the array becomes `[2, 4, 3]`.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 2, and the array becomes `[2, 4, 2]`.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 1, and the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 1, and the array becomes `[1, 4, 1]`.
5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and the array becomes `[4, 1]`.

However, the provided program incorrectly handles the reduction of durabilities. In the third iteration, instead of reducing the first ship's durability to 1, it might reduce it further, leading to an incorrect final state.

#### Correctness of the Program:
The program does not correctly simulate the alternating pattern of attacking the first and last ships. The function `func_1` attempts to reduce the durabilities of both the first and last ships in each iteration, which is not consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly simulate the attack sequence of the Kraken as described in the problem statement.
