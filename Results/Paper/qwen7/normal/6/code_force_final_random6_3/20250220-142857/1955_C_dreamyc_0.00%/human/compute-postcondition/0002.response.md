Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while k and len(nums) >= 2:`. The variables involved here are `k` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if both `k` is non-zero (i.e., `k > 0`) and the length of `nums` is at least 2 (i.e., `len(nums) >= 2`).

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\).
   - `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `ans` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero (`k > 0`).
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `nums` must be at least 2 (`len(nums) >= 2`).

Given these conditions, the only states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `len(nums)`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `ans` is 0**.
