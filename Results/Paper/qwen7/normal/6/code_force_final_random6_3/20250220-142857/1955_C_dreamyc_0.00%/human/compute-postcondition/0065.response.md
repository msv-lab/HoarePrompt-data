Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is a deque with exactly one element, and `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`, and `nums` has exactly one element.**
