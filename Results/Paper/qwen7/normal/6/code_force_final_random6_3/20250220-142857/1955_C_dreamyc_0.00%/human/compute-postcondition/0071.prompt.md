You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Each iteration reduces `k` by a value depending on the minimum of the first and last elements of `nums`, and updates `nums` accordingly. Once `k` becomes zero or `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop terminates. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times `b` (the last element of `nums` before it is possibly appended back) was found to be non-positive, which happens when `b` is reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. Since the loop ends when `k` is 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `k` will be 0 and `nums` will be an empty deque by the end of all iterations.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, and the length of `nums` is at least 2
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is currently 0 since no operations have been performed to change its value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1, or returns 0 if no operations have been performed to change its value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1.

Case_2: The program returns ans, which is currently 0 since no operations have been performed to change its value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
