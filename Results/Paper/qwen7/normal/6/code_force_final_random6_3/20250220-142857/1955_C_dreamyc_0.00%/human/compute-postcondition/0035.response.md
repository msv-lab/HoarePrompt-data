Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer; `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element; `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is in. Therefore, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
