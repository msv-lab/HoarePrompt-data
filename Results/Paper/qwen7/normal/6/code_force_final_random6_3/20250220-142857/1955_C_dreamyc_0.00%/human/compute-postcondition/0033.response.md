Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer; `a` is `a - x`; `b` is `b - x`; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `k` is a non-zero integer.
- `a` is set to `a - x`.
- `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element.
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.

After executing `b -= x`:
- `b` is decreased by `x`.
- The value of `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b` because `b` was just updated by subtracting `x`.
