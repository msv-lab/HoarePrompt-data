Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer; `a` is `a - x`; `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element; `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is decreased by `x`, which is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `k`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
