Postcondition: `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a > 0`, then depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * x`:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`.
- Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`.
If `a <= 0`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `a` and `b` remain as the first and last elements of `nums` after removing the leftmost and rightmost elements respectively, with `x` being the minimum of `a` and `b`.
