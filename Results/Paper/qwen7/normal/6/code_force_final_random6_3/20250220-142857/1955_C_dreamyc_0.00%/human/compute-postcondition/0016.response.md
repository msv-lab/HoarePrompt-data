Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-zero integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times x\), `k` is decreased by \(2 \times x\), and `b` is decreased by `x`. If `k` is less than \(2 \times x\), `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `a` is greater than 0.**
