Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer; `len(nums)` is at least 1; `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element; `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()` removes the leftmost element from the list `nums` and assigns it to `a`, then removes the rightmost element from the list `nums` and assigns it to `b`. Since `len(nums)` was at least 2 initially, after these operations, `len(nums)` will be at least 1. The values of `k` and `len(nums)` before the operation remain unchanged.
