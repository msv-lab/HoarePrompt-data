Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-zero integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is 1 or 2, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially either 0 or 1, after executing this line, `ans` will be 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
