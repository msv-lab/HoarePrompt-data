The code snippet `nums.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, or `ans` directly. It only modifies the list `nums` by adding an element to it.

Given the initial conditions:
- `k` is a non-zero integer.
- `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element.
- `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element.
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- If `a` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 times `x`, and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`.
- Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- If `a` is not greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1.

Since the code only appends `b` to `nums`, none of the conditions specified in the postconditions are triggered. Therefore, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `ans` is unchanged.**
