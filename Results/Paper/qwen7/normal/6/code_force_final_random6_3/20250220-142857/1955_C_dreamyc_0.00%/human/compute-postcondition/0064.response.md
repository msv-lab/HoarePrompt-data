Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `nums` is an empty deque, `ans` is the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Each iteration reduces `k` by a value depending on the minimum of the first and last elements of `nums`, and updates `nums` accordingly. Once `k` becomes zero or `nums` has less than 2 elements, the loop terminates. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times `b` (the last element of `nums` before it is possibly appended back) was found to be non-positive, which happens when `b` is reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. Since the loop ends when `k` is 0 or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `k` will be 0 and `nums` will be an empty deque by the end of all iterations.
