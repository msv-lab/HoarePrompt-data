Output State: **`k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `k` or `nums`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
