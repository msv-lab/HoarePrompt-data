Output State: **`count` is `mod_x_map.get(x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % x` to the variable `mod_x_key`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the other variables from the initial state, with the addition of `mod_x_key` being set to `num % x`.
