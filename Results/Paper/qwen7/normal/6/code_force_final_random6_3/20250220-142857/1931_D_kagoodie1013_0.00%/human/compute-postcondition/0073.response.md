Output State: **`count` is `mod_x_map.get(x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0) + 1`, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `x`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count related to `mod_x_key` (which is `x`) in the `mod_x_map` dictionary. Since `mod_x_map` was initially an empty dictionary, the value of `mod_x_map[x]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
