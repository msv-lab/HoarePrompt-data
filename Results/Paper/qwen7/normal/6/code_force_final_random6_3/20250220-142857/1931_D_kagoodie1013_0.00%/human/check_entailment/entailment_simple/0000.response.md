Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it to form test cases. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases with large inputs.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - It iterates through each element of the array, calculates the remainders, and updates the counts in the dictionaries.
   - For each element, it checks how many previous elements have the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y`. This is done by looking up the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` and adding them to the count.
   - The count is incremented by the sum of these values, which gives the number of beautiful pairs involving the current element.

3. **Result Collection**: The count for each test case is appended to the `results` list, which is returned at the end.

The logic is sound and correctly implements the problem statement. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies noted in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
