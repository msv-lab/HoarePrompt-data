Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into a list of test cases.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs.
3. For each element in the array, it calculates the modulo values with respect to `x` and `y`.
4. It uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of these modulo values.
5. For each element, it checks if there are any previous elements that match the required conditions (i.e., the sums and differences are divisible by `x` and `y` respectively).
6. The function correctly updates the counts in the dictionaries and accumulates the result.
7. The final result is a list of counts for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
