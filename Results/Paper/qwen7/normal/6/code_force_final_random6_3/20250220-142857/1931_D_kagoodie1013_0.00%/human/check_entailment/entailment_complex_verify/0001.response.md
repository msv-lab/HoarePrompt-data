### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction:**
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and updates the count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Modulo Calculations:**
   - The calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x` is correct. This ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The calculation of `mod_y` as `num % y` is correct. This ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Count Calculation:**
   - The count of beautiful pairs is calculated correctly by summing up the counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each element.
   - The logic for updating the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` is correct, ensuring that the counts are accurately maintained.

5. **Final Result:**
   - The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem statement and the example provided.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem statement. The original assessment was accurate.

### Final:
**True**
