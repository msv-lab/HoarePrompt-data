Output State: `count` is the sum of `mod_x_map.get(x, 0)` plus `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` plus the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` for each iteration, plus the total number of iterations (which is the length of `arr`), `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have all its elements processed, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is `num % y` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appears, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is `-num % x` for each element in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appears, and `num` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has executed for all elements in `arr`. The `count` variable accumulates the sum of occurrences of specific remainders as defined in the loop, while `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` track the frequency of these remainders across all elements in `arr`.
