Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of `count` for each iteration over all the tuples in `test_cases`. Each `count` is calculated based on the modulo operations performed on each element in the array `arr` with respect to `x` and `y`. Specifically, for each element in `arr`, the code calculates `-num % x` and `num % y`, and updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the counts of these remainders. The `count` variable accumulates the sum of the counts from both maps for each element in `arr`. After processing all tuples in `test_cases`, `results` will contain the final `count` value for each tuple, resulting in a list of these summed counts.

The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries will be updated for each tuple in `test_cases`, but their final state will not be included in the `results` list. The `test_cases` list will be empty after all tuples have been processed, and `count` will retain the final value calculated from the last tuple's array.
