Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `test_cases` remains a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The variable `count` will hold the total sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1` for every element `num` in `arr`. The `mod_x_map` dictionary will contain entries for each unique `mod_x_key` (i.e., `num % x`) seen in `arr`, with the value being the count of how many times each `mod_x_key` appears. Similarly, the `mod_y_map` dictionary will contain entries for each unique `mod_y_key` (i.e., `num % y`) seen in `arr`, with the value being the count of how many times each `mod_y_key` appears.

In summary, `count` will reflect the cumulative sum of occurrences of each modulus value from both `x` and `y` across all elements in `arr`, and both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will map each possible modulus result to its frequency within the array.
