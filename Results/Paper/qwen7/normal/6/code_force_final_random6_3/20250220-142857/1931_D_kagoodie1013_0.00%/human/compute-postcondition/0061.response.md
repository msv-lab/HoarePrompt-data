Output State: The `count` variable will hold the sum of all occurrences where the modulo operations result in keys that have been previously seen and stored in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. For each iteration, `mod_x_key` will be set to `num % x` and `mod_y_key` will be set to `num % y`. After all iterations, `mod_x_map` will contain the count of each unique `mod_x_key` encountered, and `mod_y_map` will contain the count of each unique `mod_y_key` encountered.

The final `count` will be the cumulative sum of the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each `num` in `arr`, considering both `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
