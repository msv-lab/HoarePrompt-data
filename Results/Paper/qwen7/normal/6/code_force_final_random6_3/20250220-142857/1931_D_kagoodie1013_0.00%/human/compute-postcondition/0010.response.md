Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, and `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y_key = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns the result to `mod_y_key`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mod_y_key` as `num % y`.
