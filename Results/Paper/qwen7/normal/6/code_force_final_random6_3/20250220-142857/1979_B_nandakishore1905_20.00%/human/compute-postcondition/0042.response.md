Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. This implies that `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Since the actual values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
