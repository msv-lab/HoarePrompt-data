Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them into `n` and `m`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `k`, or `i` directly. The value of `i` is updated to be 1 more than its previous value, but since the initial value of `i` was not specified, it remains as "the previous value of `i` plus 1". The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as they were before the code execution, with `k` being the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
