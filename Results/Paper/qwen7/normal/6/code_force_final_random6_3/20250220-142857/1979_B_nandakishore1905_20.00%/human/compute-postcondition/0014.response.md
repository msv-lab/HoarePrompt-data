Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- The absolute difference `k` is not a power of 2.
- Either `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even.
- Currently, `n` is equal to 0 and `m` is an even number.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(2)` will directly print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
