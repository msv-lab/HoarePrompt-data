Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is an odd number, then `n` is 0 and `m` is odd. Otherwise, `k` is not a power of 2, and `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
