Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`**.

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the binary string `l`, which represents the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. This length is stored in the variable `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
