Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- The absolute difference `k` is not a power of 2.
- Currently, `n` is 0 and `m` is an odd number.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(1)
```

Given that `n` is 0 and `m` is an odd number, the print statement will simply output the integer 1.

Output: **1**
