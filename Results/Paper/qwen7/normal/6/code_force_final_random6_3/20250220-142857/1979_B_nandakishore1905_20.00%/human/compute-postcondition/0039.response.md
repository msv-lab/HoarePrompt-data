Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from `t`.
   - `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

3. **Understand the if-else block**:
   - If `k` is a power of 2, `k` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `k` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
   - Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain as they were before the if-else block.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and the number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, the only variable that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` will retain their values from the previous iteration unless they are modified within the if-else block, but since no modification is specified outside the if-else block, they will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2.**

However, since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` are not specified to change, we can simplify this to just adjusting `i`:

State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1**.
