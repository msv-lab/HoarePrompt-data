Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 according to the initial state, and its new value is the previous value of `i` plus 1. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the integers obtained from the input.
