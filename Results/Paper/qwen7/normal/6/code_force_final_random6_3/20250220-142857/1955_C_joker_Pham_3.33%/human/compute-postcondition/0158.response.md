Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `sunks`. The only change is that the execution will now proceed outside the loop or conditional block where the `break` statement was placed.
