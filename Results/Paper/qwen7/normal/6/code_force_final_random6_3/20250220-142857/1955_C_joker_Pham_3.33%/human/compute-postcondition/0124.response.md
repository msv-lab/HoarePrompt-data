Output State: **Postcondition: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the conditions and postconditions remain the same as the initial state.
