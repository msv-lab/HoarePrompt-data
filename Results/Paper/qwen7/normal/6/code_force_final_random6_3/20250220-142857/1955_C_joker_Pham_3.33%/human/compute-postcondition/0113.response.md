Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are indices within the list `a` such that `r` is not decremented to a point where `l > r`, `sunks` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`, then `sunks` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by twice the value of `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`, and if `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is increased by 1; `r` is decremented by 1, and we continue the loop. If `k` is not greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`, then if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `l` is increased by 1, and `k` remains unchanged.
