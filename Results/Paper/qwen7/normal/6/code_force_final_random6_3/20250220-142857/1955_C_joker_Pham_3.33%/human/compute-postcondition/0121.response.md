Output State: **`sunks` is increased by 1, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `sunks`, `l`, and `r`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state, and the program breaks out of the specified control structure.
