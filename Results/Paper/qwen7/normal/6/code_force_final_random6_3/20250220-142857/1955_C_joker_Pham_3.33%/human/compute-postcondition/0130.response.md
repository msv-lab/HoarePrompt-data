Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1, `k` is equal to `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables (`l`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `l` is now less than or equal to `r - 1`, `k` remains as `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.
