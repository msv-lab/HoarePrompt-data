### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also correctly reads the durability of the ships into a list `a`. This part is correct.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the parsed values and prints the result. This is done correctly.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It maintains a count of sunk ships `sunks`.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, alternating between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there are enough attacks left (`k > 0`) and handles the case where only one ship remains.
   - For each attack, it checks which ship to attack based on their durability and updates the durability and the count of sunk ships accordingly.
   - The logic to handle the case where a ship's durability reaches zero and it is removed from further consideration is correct.

However, there are some issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Durability Updates**: The logic for updating the durability of the ships when they are attacked is flawed. Specifically, the code subtracts the full durability of the ship from `k` even when the ship's durability is less than `k`. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when `k` is large relative to the durability of the ships.
  
- **Handling Remaining Durability**: The code does not properly handle the case where the remaining durability of a ship is less than `k` but greater than 0. This can lead to undercounting the number of sunk ships.

- **Edge Case Handling**: While the function handles the edge cases where all ships sink before the end of the attacks and the scenario where the last remaining ship has exactly the required number of attacks to sink it, there might still be edge cases where the logic fails due to the above issues.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem description:
- For `n=4`, `k=5`, and `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the expected output is 2. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the sequence of attacks as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified in the implementation, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program does not correctly handle the durability updates and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

**Final: False**
