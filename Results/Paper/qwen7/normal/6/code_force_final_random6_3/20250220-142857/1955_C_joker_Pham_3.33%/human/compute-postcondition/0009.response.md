Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 1\), `sunks` is 1, and currently `l` equals `r`.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Since `sunks` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
