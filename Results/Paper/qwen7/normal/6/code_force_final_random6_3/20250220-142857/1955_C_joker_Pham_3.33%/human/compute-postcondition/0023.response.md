Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 2\), `sunks` is 2, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[0]\), and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[0]`.** 

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the given if and else parts. If the condition `a[r] == 0` is true, the specified changes are applied. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
