Postcondition: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `a[r] * 2 - 1 != k`, then `k` is adjusted to `k - a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.
