Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are indices within the list `a` such that `r` is not decremented to a point where `l > r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by twice the value of `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`, and if `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is increased by 1; `r` is decremented by 1, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to the variables when `continue` is encountered, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `sunks` remain unchanged from their previous states. The loop continues its execution from the next iteration.
