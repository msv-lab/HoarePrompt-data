Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is increased by 1, `r` and `sunks` retain their original values, `k` is decreased by twice the value of `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `l` has been incremented by 1, while `r` and `sunks` remain unchanged from their initial states. The values of `k` and `a[l]` are updated according to the specified operations, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.
