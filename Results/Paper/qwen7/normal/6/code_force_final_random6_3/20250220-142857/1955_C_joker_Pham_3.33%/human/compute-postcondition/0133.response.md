Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is equal to `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Since `sunks` was already increased by 1 under certain conditions (if `a[r]` equals 0), incrementing it again does not change the fact that it is increased by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
