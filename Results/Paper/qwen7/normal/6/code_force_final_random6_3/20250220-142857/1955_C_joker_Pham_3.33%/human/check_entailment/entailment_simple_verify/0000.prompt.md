You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1` when `l == r`, `sunks` will be incremented by 1 and the loop will break. Otherwise, `sunks` will reflect the total number of valid operations performed throughout the iterations.

    #In more detail, `sunks` will be the sum of all increments made during each iteration of the loop, indicating how many times the conditions were met to perform operations on the list `a`.

The variable `k` will hold the remaining value that could not be used to further reduce the elements in the list according to the specified rules.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the durability of the first or last ship is reduced to zero but the Kraken continues to attack them. Specifically, the logic inside the `while` loop does not correctly handle the scenario where a ship's durability is exactly half of `k`. In such cases, the ship should sink, but the current implementation may not account for this properly.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `k = 6`
- Durability of ships: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`

According to the problem description, the sequence of attacks would be:
1. Attack the first ship: Durability becomes 0, a = [2, 4, 3]
2. Attack the last ship: Durability becomes 2, a = [2, 4, 1]
3. Attack the first ship: Durability becomes 1, a = [1, 4, 1]
4. Attack the last ship: Durability becomes 0, a = [1, 4]

In this case, the program should output `3` because three ships have sunk. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the situation where the last ship's durability is exactly halved by the remaining attacks, leading to an incorrect result.
