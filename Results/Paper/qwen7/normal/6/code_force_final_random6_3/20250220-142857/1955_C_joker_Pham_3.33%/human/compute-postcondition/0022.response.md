Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 2\), `sunks` is 2, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[0]\), `a[r]` is decreased by `a[0]`, and the condition `a[r] == 0` is true.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
