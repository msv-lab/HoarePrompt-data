To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - `h` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `h` is 0, `day` becomes 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` remains 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` and `h` remain unchanged.

3. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's consider different scenarios for `h` and `m`:

- **Scenario 1**: `h` is 0
  - `day` becomes 'AM'.
  - `h` is set to 12.
  - The print statement will output `12:00 AM`.

- **Scenario 2**: `h` is greater than 12
  - `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
  - `day` remains 'PM'.
  - For example, if `h` is 15, it will become 3, and `day` will remain 'PM'. The print statement will output `03:00 PM`.

- **Scenario 3**: `h` is 12
  - `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - The print statement will output `12:00 AM`.

- **Scenario 4**: `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive
  - `day` and `h` remain unchanged.
  - For example, if `h` is 9 and `m` is 30, the print statement will output `09:30 AM` or `09:30 PM` depending on the value of `day`.

Since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified, we need to consider the general format of the output based on the conditions provided.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}** (where `{h:02d}` and `{m:02d}` represent the formatted hour and minute respectively, and `{day}` represents either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described).
