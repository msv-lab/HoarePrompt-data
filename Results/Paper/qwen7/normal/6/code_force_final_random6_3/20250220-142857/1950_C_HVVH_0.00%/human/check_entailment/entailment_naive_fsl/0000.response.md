Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `h` is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when `h` is 12, it should be represented as "12:00 PM" in the 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, leading to incorrect outputs for times like "12:00" and "12:59".

For example, for the input "12:00", the program will output "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". This violates the problem description, making the program incorrect.
