Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic for converting 24-hour format times to 12-hour format times.
- The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
- For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hour `h` and minute `m`.
- The logic for determining whether the time is in the AM or PM period is correct:
  - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and the day is set to 'AM'.
  - If `h` is greater than 12, it is reduced by 12 and the day is set to 'PM'.
  - Otherwise, the day is set to 'PM', and if `h` is exactly 12, it is adjusted to 'AM'.
- The formatted output is printed correctly using f-strings to ensure the hour and minute are displayed with leading zeros if necessary.
- The function does not return any value but prints the results directly, which matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
