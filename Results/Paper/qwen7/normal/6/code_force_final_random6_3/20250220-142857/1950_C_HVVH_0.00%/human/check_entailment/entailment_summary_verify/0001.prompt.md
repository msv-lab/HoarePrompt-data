You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints out each converted time. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but leaves the variables `h`, `m`, and `day` in their final states reflecting the last processed time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day = 'AM'`: This initializes the variable `day` to 'AM', which is correct for the start of the day.
   
2. **Reading Input**:
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - The loop runs `n` times, processing each test case one by one.
   
3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `(h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))`: This correctly splits the input string `hh:mm` into hour (`h`) and minute (`m`), converting them to integers.
   
4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - If `h == 0`, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM.
   - If `h > 12`, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because any hour greater than 12 in 24-hour format needs to be adjusted by subtracting 12 to convert to 12-hour format.
   - Otherwise, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' and checks if `h` is 12 to switch between AM and PM. This logic is flawed because:
     - For `h == 12`, it should be 'PM'.
     - For `h < 12`, it should be 'AM'.

### Correct Logic for Determining AM/PM:
- If `h == 0`, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h > 12`, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, set `day` to 'AM' if `h < 12` and 'PM' if `h == 12`.

### Revised Code:
```python
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has an issue with the logic for determining whether the time is in the AM or PM period. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
