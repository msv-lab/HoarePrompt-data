Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `h` is 12, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The variable `h` is directly assigned the value `12`, overriding its previous value which was an input integer (specifically 0). The `day` variable remains unchanged as 'AM', and the value of `m` remains as an input integer since no operation was performed on it.
