Output State: **`day` is 'PM', `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code sets `day` to 'PM', overriding its previous value which was either 'AM' or 'PM'. The values of `h` and `m` remain unchanged as they are updated to the integers read from the input separated by a colon. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `day` value and the unchanged `h` and `m` values.
