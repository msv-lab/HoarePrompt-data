Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time. It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters (`def func():`), and the description only provides constraints and expected behavior without specifying the exact return values for different cases, we need to clarify the intended functionality more precisely. Based on the given constraints and output cases, the function likely processes the integer `t` and the string `s` to determine a specific outcome.

Given the constraints and the typical nature of such problems, the function might convert the time string `s` into minutes and then compare it with the integer `t` to determine a specific output. But since the function definition does not include these parameters, we'll focus on the general structure:
