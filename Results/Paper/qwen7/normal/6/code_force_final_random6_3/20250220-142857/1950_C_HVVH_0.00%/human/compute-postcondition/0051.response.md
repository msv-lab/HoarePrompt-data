Postcondition: `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12, `m` remains unchanged, and `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is updated to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12, `day` changes to 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains unchanged and `h` and `m` remain as input integer values.
