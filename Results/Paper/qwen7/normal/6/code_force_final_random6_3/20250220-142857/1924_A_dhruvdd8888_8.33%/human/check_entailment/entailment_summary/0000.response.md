Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and the string \( s \).
3. It initializes a set `us` containing the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
4. It uses a set `win` to keep track of characters seen so far from `us` in the string \( s \).
5. As it iterates through the string \( s \), it adds characters to `win` and clears it when \( k \) unique characters have been found.
6. If at least \( n \) unique characters are found in `win`, it prints 'YES'.
7. If fewer than \( n \) unique characters are found, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that includes all missing characters from `us` and appends 'a' to make the total length \( n \).

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop.
- The variable `ps` is used to count the number of unique characters found, but it is not necessary since we can directly check the size of `win`.
- The logic to construct the output string `ans` is flawed because it only appends the last character found and does not ensure that all required characters are included.

Given these points, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all possible strings of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of \( s \).

Correctness: **False**
