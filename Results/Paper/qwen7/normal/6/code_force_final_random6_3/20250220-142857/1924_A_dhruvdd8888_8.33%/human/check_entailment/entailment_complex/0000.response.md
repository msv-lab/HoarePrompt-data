Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `n, k, m`: These are read from the input and represent the required string length, the number of alphabets to consider, and the length of the string `s`, respectively.
   - `s`: The input string of length `m`.
   - `us`: A set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win`: A set that keeps track of the characters seen so far in the string `s`.
   - `ans`: A list that accumulates characters from `s` as they match the first `k` alphabets.
   - `ps`: A counter that tracks the number of unique characters seen in `s`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is in `us`, it adds it to `win` and increments `ps`.
   - Once `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the current character to `ans` and resets `win` and `ps`.
   - After processing the entire string `s`, the function checks if `ps` (which should be at least `n` for all combinations to be present) is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` by appending characters from `us` that are not in `win`, followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where `s` might not contain enough unique characters to form all possible strings of length `n`.
   - The logic for constructing the missing string `ans` ensures that the output meets the requirement of being a valid string of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function accurately implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - The construction of the missing string `ans` is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
