Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `s` is also unaffected. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `s`, and the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `m` remain the same as the initial state.
