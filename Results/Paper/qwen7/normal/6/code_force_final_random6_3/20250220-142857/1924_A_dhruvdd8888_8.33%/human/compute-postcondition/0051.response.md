Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` to iterate over the set `us`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `ps` is `m`.
   - `i` is the second element in `us` but not in `win`.
   - `s` is the same set as `us`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is the second element in `us` and `us` contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, the next value of `i` would be the third element in `us`.

4. **Check the Condition**:
   - The condition `if i not in win:` remains unchanged if `i` is not in `win`. Given that `i` is the second element in `us` and not in `win`, this condition will still hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `win` remains unchanged.
   - `us` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `ps` remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes to the third element in `us`.
   - `s` remains the same set as `us`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ps` is `m`, `i` is the third element in `us` but not in `win`, and `s` is the same set as `us`**.
