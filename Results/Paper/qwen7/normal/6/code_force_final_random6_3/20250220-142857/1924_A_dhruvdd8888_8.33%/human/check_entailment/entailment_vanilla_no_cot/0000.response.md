Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the logic for checking subsequences, but it is not fully implemented. The function should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if they are subsequences of the input string `s`.

2. **Logic for generating and checking subsequences**: The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if these strings are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if a specific sequence of characters forms a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Incorrect handling of output**: The program prints "NO" and a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` when it finds a missing subsequence. However, the program does not correctly generate all possible strings of length `n` and check them against `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(us, repeat=n)]
    
    found_all = True
    for string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(s, string):
            print('NO')
            print(string)
            found_all = False
            break
    
    if found_all:
        print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version:
- Uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Checks each generated string to see if it is a subsequence of the input string `s`.
- Prints "NO" and the first missing string if any are found, otherwise prints "YES".
