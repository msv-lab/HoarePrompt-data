Postcondition: `win` is a set of integers containing the element `i`, `us` is a set of integers, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`, `ps` is 2, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `s` is the same set. This is because if `len(win) == k`, then `win` remains unchanged (since it's an empty set and `k` doesn't affect it), `us`, `ans`, `ps`, `i`, and `s` are updated as specified in the if part, and there is no change in the else part.
