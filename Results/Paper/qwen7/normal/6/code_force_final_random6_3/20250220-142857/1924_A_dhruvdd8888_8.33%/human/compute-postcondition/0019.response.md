Output State: **`win` is a set of integers containing the element `i`, `us` is a set of integers, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`, `ps` is 1, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `s` is the same set.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains the element `i`, after appending `i` again, `ans` now contains two elements, both being `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
