Postcondition: `win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ps` is `m`, `i` is the third element in `us` but not in `win`, and `s` is the same set as `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, the condition remains unchanged.
