Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.

    #State: `win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ps` is `m`, `i` is the last element in `s`, and `s` is the same set.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ps` is `m`, `i` is the last element in `s`, and `s` is the same set, with `ps` being less than `n`
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ps` is `m`, `i` is the last element in `us` but not in `win`, and `s` is the same set as `us`. If any element in `us` is not in `win`, it gets appended to `ans` followed by `a` repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `win` will still contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The variable `us` will also remain the same, containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The list `ans` will have exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The variable `ps` will still be equal to `m`. The variable `i` will be the last element in `us` that is not in `win`. The set `s` will remain unchanged, being the same as `us`. The loop will continue appending elements from `us` to `ans` until all elements in `us` that are not in `win` have been processed, with each appended element followed by `a` repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: n and k (both integers between 1 and 26), m (an integer between 1 and 1000), and s (a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets). It does not return any value but checks if the string s contains at least n distinct characters from the first k lowercase English alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and appends missing characters to the end of the string s, each followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.
