Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `can_survive` is True, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the total bullets needed by adding the `bullets_used` (which is 0) to the `health` of the first monster. Since `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is simply the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
