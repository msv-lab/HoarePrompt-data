Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is now `health`, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)`**.

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` increases the value of `bullets_used` by the value of `health`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `bullets_used` is updated to `health`, and `total_bullets_needed` is now `health + bullets_used`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
