Postcondition: **`monsters` must contain at least one tuple, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
