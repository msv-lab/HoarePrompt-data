Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is now `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `pos` is the position of the next monster in the list, `health` is the health of the next monster in the list**.

The code sets `can_survive` to `False`, which means the condition for survival has been explicitly set to false regardless of the previous state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
