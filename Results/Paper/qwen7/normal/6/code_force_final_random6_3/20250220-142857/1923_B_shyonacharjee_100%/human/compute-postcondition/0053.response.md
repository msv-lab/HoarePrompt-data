Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the next monster, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(pos)` for the next monster.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
