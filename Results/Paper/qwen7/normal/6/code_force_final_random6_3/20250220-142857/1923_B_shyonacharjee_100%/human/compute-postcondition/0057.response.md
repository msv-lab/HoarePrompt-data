Postcondition: `can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(pos)` for the next monster, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`. If `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, the postcondition does not change.
