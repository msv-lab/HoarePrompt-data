Postcondition: `can_survive` is True, `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, and the current value of `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.
