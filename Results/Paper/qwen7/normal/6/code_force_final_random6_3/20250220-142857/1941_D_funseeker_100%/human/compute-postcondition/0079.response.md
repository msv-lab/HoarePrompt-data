Output State: **`c` is a character. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', then no change is made to `temp`. `temp` now contains the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` to be `(q - r) % n`. This operation is only performed if `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged. The initial conditions for `c` and `temp` are preserved except that `temp` is now updated to `(q - r) % n`.
