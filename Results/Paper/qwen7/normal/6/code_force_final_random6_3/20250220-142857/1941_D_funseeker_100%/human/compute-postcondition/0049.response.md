Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` added to it, regardless of the value of `c` being '1' or '?'.

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `ans` maintains its requirement of containing at least one element, and `temp` will include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` irrespective of whether `c` is '1' or '?'.
