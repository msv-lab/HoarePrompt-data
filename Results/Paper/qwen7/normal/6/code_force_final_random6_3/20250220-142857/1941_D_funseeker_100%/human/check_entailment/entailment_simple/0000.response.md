### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and converts the result to an integer, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()` and splits the resulting string into integers, returning a list of these integers.
   - `func_4()` initializes the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`. It also initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`:**
   - The function iterates `m` times, reading each throw's distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include all possible new positions of the ball based on the direction `c` being '0', '1', or '?'.
   - If the final position includes `0`, it replaces `0` with `n` to handle circular indexing correctly.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.

3. **Handling Directions:**
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', the ball can move clockwise, so `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', the ball can move counterclockwise, so `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - This ensures that both possible directions are considered for each throw.

4. **Circular Indexing:**
   - The use of modulo `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly within the range of players.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If the final position includes `0`, it is replaced with `n` to ensure the positions are correctly mapped within the range `[1, n]`.

### Conclusion:

The logic in `func_4` correctly handles all the requirements of the problem statement. It considers all possible directions for each throw and updates the set of possible positions accordingly. The final adjustments ensure that the positions are correctly mapped within the range of players.
