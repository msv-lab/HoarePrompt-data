Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved in this loop are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `ans`. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `ans` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `q` is an element from `ans`, and `ans` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, `ans` will still contain at least one element in the next iteration.
   - The value of `q` will change to the next element in `ans` during the next iteration.

4. **Maintain the Other States**:
   - `temp` contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. These values depend on the current value of `q`, which changes with each iteration.
   - The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?', and this does not change based on the loop condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ans` will still contain at least one element.
- `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
- `temp` will be updated based on the new value of `q`.
- `c` remains either '1' or '?'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'**.
