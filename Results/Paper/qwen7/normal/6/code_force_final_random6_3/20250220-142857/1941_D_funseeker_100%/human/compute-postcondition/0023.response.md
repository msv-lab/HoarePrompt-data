Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', `temp` is now equal to `(q + r) % n`, and `temp` has added the value `(q - r) % n` to itself.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` was previously equal to `(q + r) % n`, after adding `(q - r) % n`, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
