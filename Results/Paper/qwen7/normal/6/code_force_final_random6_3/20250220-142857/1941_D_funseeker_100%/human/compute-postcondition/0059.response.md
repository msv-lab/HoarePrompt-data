Output State: **`ans` now contains all the elements from `temp`, and `temp` no longer exists as a separate variable.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the contents of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now includes all the elements that were previously stored in `temp`. Since `ans` was already containing at least one element and `temp` was holding all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, after this assignment, `ans` will contain all these values. Additionally, since `ans` now holds all the elements from `temp`, the variable `temp` is no longer needed and effectively ceases to exist in the current context.
