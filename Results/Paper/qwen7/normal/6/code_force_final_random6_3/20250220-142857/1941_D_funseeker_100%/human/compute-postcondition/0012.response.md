Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and `ans` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`. After executing the code, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
