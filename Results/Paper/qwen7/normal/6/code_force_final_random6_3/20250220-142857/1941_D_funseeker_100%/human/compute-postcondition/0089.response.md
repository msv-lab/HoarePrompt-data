Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing up to three elements depending on the value of `c` in each iteration, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character, and `q` is the last element processed in the loop.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `ans` will still contain at least one element as it did not change within the loop.
- The variable `temp` will be a set that may contain up to three elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and possibly another element based on the value of `c` in the last iteration.
- The variable `m` remains greater than 0 as it was not modified in the loop.
- The variables `r` and `c` retain their values from the last execution of the loop.
- The variable `q` will hold the last element that was processed in the loop.
