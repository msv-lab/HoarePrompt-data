Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', and `temp` now contains `(q + r) % n`.**

The code adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
