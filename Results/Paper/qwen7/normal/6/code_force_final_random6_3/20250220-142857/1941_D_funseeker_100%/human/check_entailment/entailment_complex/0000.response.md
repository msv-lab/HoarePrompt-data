Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Inputs**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_4()` processes the game logic based on the number of players, number of throws, initial player, and the sequence of throws.

2. **Function 4 Analysis**:
   - `func_4()` correctly initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - It iterates `m` times, where each iteration processes a throw with distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` with `temp`.
   - Finally, it handles the special case where the ball might be at position `0` and adjusts it to `n`.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints the number of unique positions the ball can be in (`len(ans)`).
   - It then prints the sorted list of these positions.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the logic in `func_4()` correctly simulates the ball's movement based on the given rules and constraints. The implementation handles all edge cases, such as the special adjustment for position `0` to `n`, and ensures that the output is formatted as required.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
