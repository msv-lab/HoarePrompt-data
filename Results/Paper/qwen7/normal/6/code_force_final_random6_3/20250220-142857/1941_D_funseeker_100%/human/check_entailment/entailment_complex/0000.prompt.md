Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
t = func_2()
for i in range(t):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The list of moves consists of m tuples, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string. This operation is performed without requiring any input parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. For each of the m lines, r_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1, and c_i is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the function `func_1()` for the given test case parameters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it relies on the test case parameters t, n, m, x, r_i, and c_i which are presumably provided externally. It calls another function `func_1()` for each test case and returns an integer value obtained from `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. Each of the next m lines contains an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting a string returned by func_1() and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is derived by first obtaining a string from `func_1()`, then splitting this string into individual elements, and finally converting each element to an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c for each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws which must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character ('0', '1', or '?').
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws which must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws including `n`, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character ('0', '1', or '?').
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of possible positions the ball can be in after m throws, including n)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted elements of ans (a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after m throws, including n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes the number of players, number of throws, and the initial player position to determine all possible positions the ball can be in after all throws. It then prints the count of these positions and lists them in sorted order.
