Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, `c` is either '1' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained the element `(q + r) % n`, after adding `(q - r) % n`, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
