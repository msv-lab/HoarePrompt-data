Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to handle reading a line, an integer, and a list of integers respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`:
   - If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), it updates the set `temp` with the new positions.
   - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Index**: After processing all throws, it adjusts for the case where the player index might wrap around to zero by adding `n` to the zero index.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their sorted indices.

The program handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
