Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them to form a new rectangle. The key observation here is that for Bob to achieve this, at least one of the dimensions (either \(a\) or \(b\)) must be divisible by 2. This is because:

- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the smallest possible resulting rectangles after cutting will also be odd, and no combination of these can form a rectangle with a dimension that is not odd.
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle with at least one even dimension.

The provided code checks if \(b\) is even using `b % 2 == 0`. If \(b\) is even, it prints 'yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If \(b\) is odd, it prints 'no', indicating that another rectangle cannot be formed. However, this logic is incomplete because we should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, not just \(b\).

Given the problem statement and the need to check both dimensions, the function should be modified to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. Hereâ€™s the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

With this correction, the function correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle.

# Correctness: **False**

The provided function only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient according to the problem requirements. It needs to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
