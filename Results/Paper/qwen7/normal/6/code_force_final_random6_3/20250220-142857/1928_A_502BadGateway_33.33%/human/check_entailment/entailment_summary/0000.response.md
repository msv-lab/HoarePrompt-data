Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the `func_1` function only checks if `b` is even, but it fails to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and form a new one. According to the problem statement, a rectangle can be cut either horizontally or vertically, and the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. 

For instance, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle. However, the current function does not account for such scenarios. It only checks if the second dimension (`b`) is even, which is insufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

Given the execution summary, the function should be more complex to handle all possible cuts and rearrangements. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
