The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the list), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then calculates and prints the maximum value among \( r - l - 1 \), \( n - 1 \), and \( r - l \), based on certain conditions involving consecutive duplicates in the list.
