Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program is flawed and does not cover all necessary cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 1
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `0` because we can make all elements equal by setting the entire array to the value `1` in one operation.

The program's logic is based on checking the first and last elements and counting the number of consecutive identical elements from the start and end. However, it does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal, which might involve selecting a different segment of the array.

A correct approach would involve identifying the most frequent element in the array and calculating the cost to make all other elements equal to this most frequent element. This requires a different algorithmic approach, such as counting the frequency of each element and then determining the minimum cost based on these counts.
