Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `end` is increased by 1.
   - `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - `l` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.
   - We need to ensure that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` hold true for the next iteration.

4. **Analyze each condition**:
   - `r > l`: This condition depends on the values of `r` and `l`. Since `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `r` is still greater than `l` after the decrement.
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]`: This condition depends on the array `a` and the values of `r` and `r - 1`. Since `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration, this condition should still hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure `r > l`, `r` must be greater than `l` after decrementing.
   - To ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `a[r]` must still be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `r` must be greater than `l` after decrementing.
- `a[r]` must still be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`end` is increased by 1, `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration and must be greater than `l`, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.**
