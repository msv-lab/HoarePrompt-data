Output State: `l` is equal to `r - k`, `r` is `n - k - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is `k`, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will be equal to `r - k`, where `k` is the total number of times the loop has executed. This is because `l` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, starting from an initial difference of 1 between `l` and `r`. The variable `r` decreases by 1 with each iteration, so after `k` iterations, `r` will be `n - k - 1`. The variable `st` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `end` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so after `k` iterations, `end` will be `k`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its initial or previous state, as it is not affected by the loop.
