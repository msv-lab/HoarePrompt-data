Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` is greater than 3, `st` is 3, `end` is increased by 1.**

The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After the operation, `end` becomes 1. The values of `l`, `r`, and `st` remain unchanged.
