Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 6, `end` is 3.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, and knowing that `l` increases by 1 with each iteration while `r` decreases by 1, the loop will terminate when `l` equals `r`. Since `l` starts at `n - 1 - 1` (or `n - 2`) and increases by 1 each iteration, and `r` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, they will meet when `l` reaches `n - 1`. This means the loop will run until `l` equals `n - 1`.

From the given information, after 3 iterations, `l` is 4, `r` is 3, `st` is 3, and `end` is 3. Each iteration increases `l` by 1 and `end` by 1. Therefore, if the loop continues until `l` equals `n - 1`, it will run a total of `(n - 1) - 4 + 1 = n - 4` more times. Since we already know it has run 3 times, the total number of iterations is `3 + (n - 4) = n - 1`. 

Given that `st` increments by 1 for each iteration, after all iterations, `st` will be `3 + (n - 4) = n - 1`. However, based on the provided output states, it seems `st` might increment differently or there's another factor involved, but from the given data, we can infer that `st` is 3 after 3 iterations and continues to increment by 1 per iteration, making it 6 after all iterations. Thus, the final state is `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 6, and `end` is 3.
