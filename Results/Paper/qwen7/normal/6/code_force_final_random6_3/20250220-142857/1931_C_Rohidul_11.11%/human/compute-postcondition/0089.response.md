Output State: **`l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`, and `st` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial value that was not explicitly stated but implied to be 1 (since `st += 1` implies an initial value of `st` being 1). The values of `l`, `r`, and the condition `a[2] == a[3]` remain unchanged.
