Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is 0, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and add to `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`. This process continues until it finds a pair of elements that are not identical or until `l` is no longer less than `r`. At this point, `st` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements at the start of the list, `l` will be the index right after the last pair of identical elements, and `r` remains as `n - 1` since it was not changed inside the loop.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is decreased by 1, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is 1, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `end` is increased by 1, `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `end` is increased by 1, `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration and must be greater than `l`, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
