Output State: `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is 0, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and add to `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`. This process continues until it finds a pair of elements that are not identical or until `l` is no longer less than `r`. At this point, `st` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements at the start of the list, `l` will be the index right after the last pair of identical elements, and `r` remains as `n - 1` since it was not changed inside the loop.
