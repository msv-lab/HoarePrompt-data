Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `st, end = 0, 0` assigns the value `0` to both `st` and `end`. The values of `l`, `r`, `ans`, and the conditions related to `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
