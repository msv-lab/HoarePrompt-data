Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `l` is 3
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `st` is 2 (This variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.

Given:
- `l` is currently 3.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

For the loop to continue:
- `l < r` must be true, meaning `3 < r` or `r > 3`.
- `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true, meaning `a[3] == a[4]`.

Since `r` is `n - 1`, for `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 3. Additionally, the equality check `a[3] == a[4]` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` and the condition `a[3] == a[4]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, and `a[3] == a[4]` must be true**
