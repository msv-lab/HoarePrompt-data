Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` is greater than 3, and `a[3] == a[4]` is true; `st` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial state includes `l` being 4, `r` being greater than 3, and `a[3]` being equal to `a[4]`. The code snippet increments `st` by 1. Since `st` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be 1 initially. After executing `st += 1`, `st` becomes 2. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
