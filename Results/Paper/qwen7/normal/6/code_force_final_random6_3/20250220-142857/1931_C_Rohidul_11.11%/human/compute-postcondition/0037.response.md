Postcondition: **`st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if the first and last elements are identical and there are consecutive identical elements at the start, or `len(a) - 1` if the first and last elements are not identical, or `n - 1 - l` otherwise.**
