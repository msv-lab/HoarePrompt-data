Output State: **`l` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `r` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `st` is either 4 or 0, `end` is either 4 or 0, `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `n` remains an input integer, but now `a` is updated to reflect the newly created list.
