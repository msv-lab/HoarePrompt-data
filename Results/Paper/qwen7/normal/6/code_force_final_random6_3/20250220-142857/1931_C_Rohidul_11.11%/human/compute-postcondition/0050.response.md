Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `l` is less than `r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `l` is 3.
   - `r` must be greater than 2.
   - `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`.
   - `st` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).

3. **Checking the Loop Condition**:
   - Given `l = 3`, the condition `l < r` requires `r > 3`.
   - The condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` translates to `a[3] == a[4]`. We know from the current state that `a[2] == a[3]`, but this doesn't directly help us determine `a[3] == a[4]`.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true.
   - Since `l` is 3, the first condition `l < r` requires `r > 3`.
   - The second condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` requires `a[3] == a[4]`. We don't have direct information about `a[4]`, but we know `a[2] == a[3]`. Therefore, `a[3] == a[4]` must hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `r` must be greater than 3.
   - Additionally, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]` for the second condition to hold true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`**
