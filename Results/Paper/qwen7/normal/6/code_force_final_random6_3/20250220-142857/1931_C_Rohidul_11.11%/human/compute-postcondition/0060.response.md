Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` is 3, `st` is 3, `end` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was previously increased by 1 (though the exact value before this operation was not specified), we can say that `end` is now increased by 1 from its previous state. The other variables (`l`, `r`, and `st`) remain unchanged.
