Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting the maximum length of consecutive identical elements. It then determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break this pattern. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The current logic only counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements but does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array. The logic should focus on identifying the longest segment of identical elements and calculating the number of removals required to break this segment.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array has multiple segments of identical elements or when the array is already non-beautiful.

3. **Output Logic**: The current logic outputs `-1` if `n == 1` or `ans == n`, which is incorrect. It should output `-1` only if it is impossible to remove elements to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Resetting `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is reset at the start of each iteration, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
