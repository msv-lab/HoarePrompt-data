Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is either 1 (if `a[0] == tmp`) or 0 (if `a[0] != tmp`).

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the State of `cnt`:**
   - The value of `cnt` does not change within the loop head and is not directly affected by the loop itself. Therefore, its value remains the same.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `cnt` remains either 1 (if `a[0] == tmp`) or 0 (if `a[0] != tmp`).

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `cnt` is either 1 (if `a[0] == tmp`) or 0 (if `a[0] != tmp`).**
