Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` retains its original value, and `n` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is initially 0, `ans` will either remain unchanged (if `ans` is less than or equal to 0) or be updated to 0 (if `ans` is greater than 0). The values of `i`, `n`, `tmp`, and `cnt` are updated as specified.
