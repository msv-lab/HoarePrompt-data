Output State: **`t` is 0, `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `tmp` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The variable `t` is explicitly stated to be 1 less than its current value, which means `t` becomes 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input converted to an integer using `int(input())`. All other variables (`ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
