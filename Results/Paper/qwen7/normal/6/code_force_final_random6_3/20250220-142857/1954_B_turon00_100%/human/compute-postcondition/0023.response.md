Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Analyze the given postconditions**:
   - `cnt` is updated.
   - `i` is incremented.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `tmp` remains the same.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
   - If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is reset to 0.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
   - `cnt` is updated but its exact value depends on the loop body, but it will be used in the next iteration.

Given the loop condition `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, while `n` remains the same, and all other variables (`a`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

**State: **`cnt` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is reset to 0.**
