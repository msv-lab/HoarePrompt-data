Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the requirement to remove the minimum number of elements to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of the same element and prints the complement of this count as the result. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the array stops being beautiful after the removals.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing the second element (index 1) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful. However, the program would incorrectly output `1` because it simply counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of the same element.

To fix this, the program needs to properly track and remove elements to break the beauty condition, ensuring the minimum number of removals is made.
