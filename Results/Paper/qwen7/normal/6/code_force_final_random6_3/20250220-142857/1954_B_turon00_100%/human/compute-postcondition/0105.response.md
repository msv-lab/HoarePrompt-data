Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `i` is not equal to `n`.
   - `tmp` retains its original value.
   - `n` retains its original value.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, `ans` must be 0 if it was greater than 0, or remain 0 if it was already 0.
   - Therefore, `ans` is 0.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
