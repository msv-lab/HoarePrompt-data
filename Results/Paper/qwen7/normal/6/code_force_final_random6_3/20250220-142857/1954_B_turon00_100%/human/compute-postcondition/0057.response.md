Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged and is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`. `ans` is always updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.
