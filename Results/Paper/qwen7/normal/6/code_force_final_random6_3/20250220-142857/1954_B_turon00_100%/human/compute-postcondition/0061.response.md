Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i + 2` is valid, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the minimum value between itself and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is updated based on whether the element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, the values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged except that `ans` is now the minimum of its original value and the current value of `cnt`.
