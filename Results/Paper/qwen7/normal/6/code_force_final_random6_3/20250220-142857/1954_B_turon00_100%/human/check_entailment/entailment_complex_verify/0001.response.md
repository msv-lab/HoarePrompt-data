### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0. `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. If it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If the array has only one element or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` and updating `ans` when encountering a different element seems correct.
   - However, the program does not fully address the requirement to ensure the array stops being beautiful. The current logic only counts consecutive elements but does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program does not implement the actual removal of elements and check if the array becomes non-beautiful after removals.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the program.
   - The program indeed counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - The logic of updating `ans` and handling the edge cases (single element or `ans` equals `n`) is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It does not need to simulate the actual removal process because the problem guarantees that the array is beautiful and the count of consecutive identical elements directly translates to the minimum number of removals needed.
   - The program meets the requirements of the problem statement and correctly implements the logic to find the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct as it accurately determines the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful, based on the constraints and the nature of the problem.
