Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input; `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `n`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `_`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
