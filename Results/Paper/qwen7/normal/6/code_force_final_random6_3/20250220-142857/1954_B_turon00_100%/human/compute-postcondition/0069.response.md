Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- `i` is equal to `n - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains the same list of integers.
- `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
- The condition `n == 1 or ans == n` is true.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(-1)` will execute. Since there is no further information about the values of `n`, `a`, or the loop iterations, we can directly determine that the print statement will output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
