Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- `i` is equal to `n - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains the same list of integers.
- `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
- Either `n` is not equal to 1 or `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Since `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution must be 0. This is because `cnt` is always set to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, and there is no indication that it ever gets incremented to any value other than 0 within the loop.

Therefore, `ans` will hold the value 0, as this is the only value `cnt` can take during each iteration.

Output: **0**
