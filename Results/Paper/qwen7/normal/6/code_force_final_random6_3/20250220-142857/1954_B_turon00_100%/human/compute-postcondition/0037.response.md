Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (which was `n`) and `cnt`, which is 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `n` remains the same as the initial input; `a` remains the same as the initial input list of integers; `tmp` remains the same as the first element of the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; if either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the conditions remain unchanged. If neither of these conditions is met, the conditions also remain unchanged.
