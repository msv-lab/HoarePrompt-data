Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list.
   - `tmp` is an integer.
   - `cnt` is reset to 0.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `cnt` and `ans` will retain their values unless the condition inside the loop changes them.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

However, since the exact value of `i` and the condition for updating `cnt` and `ans` depend on the loop body, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

So, the final state is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
