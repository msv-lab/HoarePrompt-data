Output State: **`t` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual elements, converts each element back to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The other variables (`t`, `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `n`, and `tmp`) are not affected by this operation.
