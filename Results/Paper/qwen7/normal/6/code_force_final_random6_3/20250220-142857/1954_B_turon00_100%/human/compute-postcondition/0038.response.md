Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (which was `n`) and `cnt`, which is 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `n` remains the same as the initial input; `a` remains the same as the initial input list of integers; `tmp` remains the same as the first element of the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
