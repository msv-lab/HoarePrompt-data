Postcondition: `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `sm` is adjusted based on the comparison between `ca[a[r - m]]` and `cb[a[r - m]]`. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is incremented by 1. `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `sm` compared to `k`.
