Postcondition: `ca[a[(r + 1) - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged depending on the condition `ca[a[(r + 1) - m]]` <= `cb[a[(r + 1) - m]]`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is 2 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
