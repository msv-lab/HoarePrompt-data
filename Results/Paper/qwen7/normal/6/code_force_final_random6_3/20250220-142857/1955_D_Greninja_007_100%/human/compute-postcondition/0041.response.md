Output State: **`ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `sm` is 0, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` decrements the value of `sm` by 1. Initially, `sm` is 1, so after executing the code, `sm` becomes 0. The other variables (`ca[a[r]]`, `m`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
