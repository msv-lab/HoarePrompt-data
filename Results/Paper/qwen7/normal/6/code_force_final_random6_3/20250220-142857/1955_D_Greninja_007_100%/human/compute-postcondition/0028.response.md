Output State: **`ca[a[(r + 1) - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is incremented by 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is 2 if `sm + 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code increments `ca[a[r]]` by 1. This affects only the value of `ca[a[r]]`. The other variables (`ca[a[(r + 1) - m]]`, `sm`, `m`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as per the initial postconditions, with the exception that `sm` is incremented by 1. The condition for `ans` remains the same, but now `sm` is `sm + 1`.
