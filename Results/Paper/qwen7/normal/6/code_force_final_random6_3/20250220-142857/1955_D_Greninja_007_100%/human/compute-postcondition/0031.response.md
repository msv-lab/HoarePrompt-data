Postcondition: `ca[a[(r + 1) - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is incremented by 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is 2 if `sm + 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `ca[a[(r + 1) - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is 0, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is 2 if `sm + 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
