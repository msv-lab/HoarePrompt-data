Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine how many subsegments of array `a` of length `m` contain at least `k` elements that are also in array `b`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `cb` is a counter of the sorted elements in `b`.
   - `ca` is a counter of the sorted elements in the initial segment of `a` of length `m`.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - `sm` is initialized as the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`.
   - If `sm` is already greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`) by 1. This checks if the initial segment of `a` of length `m` is good.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent segment of `a` of length `m`, the code updates `ca` to include the new element `a[r]` and exclude the element `a[r - m]`.
   - It adjusts `sm` based on whether the new element `a[r]` or the excluded element `a[r - m]` contributes to the count of common elements.
   - If `sm` becomes greater than or equal to `k` after these adjustments, it increments `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the sliding window correctly by updating the counters and adjusting `sm` appropriately.
   - The logic ensures that all possible subsegments of `a` of length `m` are checked.

6. **Output**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the total count of good subsegments.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
