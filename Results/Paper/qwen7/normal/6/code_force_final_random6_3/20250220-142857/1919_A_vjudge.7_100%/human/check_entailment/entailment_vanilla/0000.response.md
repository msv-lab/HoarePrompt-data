### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After each move, a coin is removed from the current player's wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
   - This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is left with no coins, at which point Bob can also make no more moves.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by mirroring his moves similarly.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided function reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` and `b` and checks if their sum is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the total number of coins, it correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins being even or odd. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
