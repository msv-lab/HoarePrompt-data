Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game according to the rules described. The logic in the `if` statement checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, which does not accurately determine the winner based on the game's rules.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (even or odd nature) of the initial number of coins in Alice's wallet (`a`). Hereâ€™s why:

- If `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that after her moves, the total number of coins is even when it's Bob's turn.
- If `a` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure that the total number of coins is even when it's Alice's turn, forcing Alice into a losing position.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This solution correctly determines the winner based on the initial number of coins in Alice's wallet.
