Reasoning:
1. The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
2. The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets determines the winner. This is because:
   - If the sum of coins is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally. This is because after each move, the sum of coins changes by at least 1 (either 2 coins are removed or one coin is swapped and one is removed), and the parity of the sum will alternate between even and odd. Since Alice starts with an even sum, she will eventually face an odd sum, and Bob will face an even sum. When the sum becomes 0 (an even number), Bob will be the one to face it, thus losing.
   - If the sum of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally. This is because the same logic applies but starting with an odd sum means Alice will face an even sum when the game reaches its end state.

3. The provided annotated program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. It prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd for each test case.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
