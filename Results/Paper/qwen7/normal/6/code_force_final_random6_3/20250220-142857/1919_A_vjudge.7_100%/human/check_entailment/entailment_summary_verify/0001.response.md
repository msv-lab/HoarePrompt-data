### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After each move, a coin is removed from the current player's wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
   - This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is left with no coins, at which point Bob can also make no more moves.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by mirroring his moves similarly.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided function reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` and `b` and checks if their sum is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - However, the implementation does not accurately reflect the game's rules. The key issue is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of coins remaining in each player's wallet, not just the total number of coins.
   - The provided function simply checks the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`), which is insufficient to determine the winner based on the actual game logic.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Game Logic vs. Implementation:**
  - The game logic requires checking the parity of the number of coins in each player's wallet after each move.
  - The provided function only checks the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`), which does not account for the actual state of the game after each move.
  - For example, consider the test case where `a = 1` and `b = 4`:
    - Initially, `a + b = 5` (odd), so the function would incorrectly print 'Alice'.
    - However, in the game, Alice can swap wallets, reducing `a` to 0 and `b` to 4. Now, Bob must remove a coin from his wallet, leaving `a = 0` and `b = 3`. Alice can then swap back, leaving `a = 3` and `b = 2`. Bob removes a coin, leaving `a = 2` and `b = 1`. Alice removes a coin, leaving `a = 1` and `b = 0`. Bob cannot make a valid move, so Alice wins.
  - The function fails to capture this dynamic nature of the game.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. It only checks the parity of the total number of coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner based on the actual game rules.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
