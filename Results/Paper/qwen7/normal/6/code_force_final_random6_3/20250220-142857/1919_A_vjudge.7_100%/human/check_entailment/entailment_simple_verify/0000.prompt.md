You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `test` must be equal to the total number of iterations, `t` will be `test`, `a` and `b` will be the last input integers split from the final input provided within the loop, and the loop has printed 'Bob' if `a + b` is even and 'Alice' if `a + b` is odd for each iteration based on the given inputs.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. According to the problem description, the player who ends up with an odd number of coins after all optimal moves will win. However, the program checks if the sum of coins `a + b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that. This logic is incorrect because the key is not the parity of the total sum but the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `Bob`
- Program Output: `Bob`

This case works correctly. However, consider another case:
- Input: `1 2`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

In this case, Alice can always win by swapping wallets and removing a coin until Bob is left with 1 coin, making Alice the winner. The program incorrectly outputs `Bob`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and should be marked as incorrect.
