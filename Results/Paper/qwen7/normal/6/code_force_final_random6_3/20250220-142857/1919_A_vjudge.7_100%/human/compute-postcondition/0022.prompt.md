Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, test is an integer obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(test):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a + b & 1 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `test` must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test` must be at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `a + b` is even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test` must be at least 1, `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers split from the input. Regardless of whether `a + b` is even or odd, the values of `test`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
