Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\).
- `n` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n` and `2 * k - 2`.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the expression `n - k + 1`.

1. **Value of `k`:** Since `k` is an integer read from standard input, its exact value is unknown until it is provided. Let's denote this value as `k_value`.

2. **Value of `n`:** The value of `n` is determined by the minimum of `n` and `2 * k_value - 2`. Therefore, `n` will be the smaller of these two values:
   - If `n >= 2 * k_value - 2`, then `n = n`.
   - If `n < 2 * k_value - 2`, then `n = 2 * k_value - 2`.

Given these conditions, the expression `n - k + 1` can be analyzed as follows:
- If `n >= 2 * k_value - 2`, then `n - k + 1` simplifies to `n - k + 1`.
- If `n < 2 * k_value - 2`, then `n - k + 1` simplifies to `(2 * k_value - 2) - k + 1 = 2 * k_value - k - 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the output based on the formula derived.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n is the minimum of n and 2 * k_value - 2, and k_value is the integer read from standard input)**
