Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
2. `n` is equal to `k`, where `k` is an integer read from standard input.
3. `_` is explicitly defined as `1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
