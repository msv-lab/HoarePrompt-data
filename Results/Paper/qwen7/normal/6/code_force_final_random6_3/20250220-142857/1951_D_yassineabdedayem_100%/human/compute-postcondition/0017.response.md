Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, no changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is set to a value such that `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.
