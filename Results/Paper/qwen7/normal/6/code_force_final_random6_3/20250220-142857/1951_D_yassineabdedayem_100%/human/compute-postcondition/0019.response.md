Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, and if `n` equals `k`, no changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `2 * k`, then no changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is set to a value such that `n + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * k`.
