Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\).
   - `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\).
   - `k` is an integer read from standard input.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `k` is an integer read from standard input, so its value is not explicitly defined here.
- `n` is determined by taking the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\).

Given these points, the expression `n - k + 1` will be evaluated with the actual value of `k` that is read from standard input and the value of `n` which is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\).

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n - k + 1`. However, we can describe it in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n is the minimum of the original n and 2 * k - 2, and k is an integer read from standard input)**
