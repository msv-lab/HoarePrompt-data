Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\).
- `n` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n` and `2 * k - 2`.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer `2`.

Since the value of `2` is explicitly stated in the code and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **2**
