State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is now 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts, but since the loop runs from `range(t)`, the first valid value for `_` is 1.
- The variable `t` is determined by user input, and it must be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is within the valid range and `_` starts from 1.
