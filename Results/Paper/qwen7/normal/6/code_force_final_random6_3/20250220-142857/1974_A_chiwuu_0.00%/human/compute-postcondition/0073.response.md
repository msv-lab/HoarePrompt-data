Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and updates the value of \(t\) based on specific conditions. Initially, \(t\) is set to \(2 \times b\), then it is adjusted based on whether \(t\) is divisible by 5, and further modified based on the comparison between \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4\) and \(a\). Finally, the function prints the updated value of \(t\) for each test case.**
