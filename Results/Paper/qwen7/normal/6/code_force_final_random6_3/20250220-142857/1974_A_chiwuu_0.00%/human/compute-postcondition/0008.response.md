Output State: **`t` is equal to `b` * 2 // 5, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`, which means `t` is now equal to its original value divided by 5 using integer division. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is divisible by 5 is maintained because the operation is integer division.
