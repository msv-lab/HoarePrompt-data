Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns the variable `t` to its current value. Therefore, the value of `t` remains as it was before, which is `b * 2`. All other variables (`t1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as well.
