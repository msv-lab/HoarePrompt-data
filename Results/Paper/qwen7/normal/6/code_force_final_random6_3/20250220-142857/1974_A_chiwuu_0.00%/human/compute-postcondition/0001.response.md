Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `n` must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Initial State Provided**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we assume it starts at 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 0) for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we can formulate the required state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
