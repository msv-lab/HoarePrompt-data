Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, and `b` is an integer from the second input split. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and `t` is adjusted based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. `t1` is less than `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t` is updated as follows: if `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1 % 15 != 0`, or `t + (a - t1) // 15` if `a - t1 % 15 == 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `b * 2 + 1`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
