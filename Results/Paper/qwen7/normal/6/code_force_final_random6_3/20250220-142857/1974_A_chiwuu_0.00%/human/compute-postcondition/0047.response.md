Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.
