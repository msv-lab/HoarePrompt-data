Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + (a - t1) // 15**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, the new value of `t` is `b * 2 + (a - t1) // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
