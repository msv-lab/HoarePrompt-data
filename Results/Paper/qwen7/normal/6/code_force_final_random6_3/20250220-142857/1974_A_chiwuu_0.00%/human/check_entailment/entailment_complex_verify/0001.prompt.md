You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop has executed all its iterations will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration. After the loop completes, `t` will be updated based on the conditions provided within the loop body. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, then adjusted according to the following rules:
    #
    #1. If `t % 5 == 0`, `t` is set to `t // 5`.
    #2. Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`.
    #3. Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #4. If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
    #5. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
    #6. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
    #7. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of these updates based on the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop. The exact value of `t` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of applying the above logic iteratively for `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and updates the value of \(t\) based on specific conditions. Initially, \(t\) is set to \(2 \times b\), then it is adjusted based on whether \(t\) is divisible by 5, and further modified based on the comparison between \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4\) and \(a\). Finally, the function prints the updated value of \(t\) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized as `b * 2`. This represents the total number of cells that would be occupied if all 2x2 icons were placed.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is set to `t // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`. This calculation seems to be an attempt to convert the total cells into the number of screens needed, but it is not accurate because it does not account for the layout constraints properly.

3. **Adjusting for Remaining Cells:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons, but the logic is flawed.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and `t` is adjusted accordingly. Again, this logic is incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Final Calculation and Output:**
   - The final value of `t` is printed, which is supposed to be the minimum number of screens needed.

### Correctness Analysis

The program's logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screen Requirements:**
   - The initial calculation of `t` as `b * 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the layout constraints of the grid.
   - The subsequent adjustments (`t1`, `t2`) are also incorrect and do not accurately reflect the placement of icons on the grid.

2. **Layout Constraints:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the layout constraints of the 5x3 grid and the different sizes of icons (1x1 and 2x2).

### Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program outputs `1`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program outputs `1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program outputs `2`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program outputs `2`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program outputs `1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program outputs `1`.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program outputs `0`.

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program outputs `1`.

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program outputs `1`.

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - The program outputs `2`.

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Expected Output: `3`
    - The program outputs `5`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. It fails to account for the layout constraints and the different sizes of icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
