The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string value of `b` into an integer. Since `b` was previously the integer value of the second word of the input split, its type is now explicitly confirmed as an integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t` is either unchanged if `t1 >= a`, or updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1 % 15 != 0`, or `t + (a - t1) // 15` if `a - t1 % 15 == 0`, and `b` is now an integer.**
