Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t` is either unchanged or updated based on the value of `t1` relative to `a`. Specifically, if `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is adjusted by adding `(a - t1) // 15` or `(a - t1) // 15 + 1` depending on whether `(a - t1) % 15 == 0`.
