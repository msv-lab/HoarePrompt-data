Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 + 1`, and `b` is now an integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by performing integer division by 5 and then adding 1. Initially, `t` is defined as `b * 2`. After executing `t = t // 5 + 1`, `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. Since `b` is an integer, the division operation results in an integer value. All other variables remain unchanged.
