Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to `t // 5 + 1`. Given that `t` was initially `b * 2`, the new value of `t` is now `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
