Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`. If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is set to `t // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `t1` the value of `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is determined based on the condition provided, but since the exact value of `t` is not specified in the initial state, it remains as described.
