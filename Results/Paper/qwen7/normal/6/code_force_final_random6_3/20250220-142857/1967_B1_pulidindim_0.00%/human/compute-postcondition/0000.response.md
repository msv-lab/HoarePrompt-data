Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and it is guaranteed that for each test case, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**
