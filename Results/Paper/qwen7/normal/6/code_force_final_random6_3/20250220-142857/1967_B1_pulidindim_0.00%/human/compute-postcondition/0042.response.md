Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / m`**

Explanation: The code `countmins = count - 1` updates the value of `countmins` by subtracting 1 from the current value of `count`. Initially, `count` is 2, so `countmins` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
