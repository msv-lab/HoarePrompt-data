Postcondition: `t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be greater than 3, `count` is now `count - 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1) + (n / (count - 1)) + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is updated to `n / (count - 1)`.

Explanation: If `g < countmins`, then `g` is updated to `n / (count - 1)`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part.
