Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) + 1 + (n / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / 4 - countmins`.**

Explanation: The code `g -= countmins` subtracts the value of `countmins` from `g`. Since `countmins` is 0, `g` is updated to `n / 4 - 0`, which simplifies to `n / 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
