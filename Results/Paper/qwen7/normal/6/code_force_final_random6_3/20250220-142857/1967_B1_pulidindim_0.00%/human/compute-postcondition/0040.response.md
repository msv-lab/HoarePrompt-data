Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is the second integer input split from `input().split()`, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / m`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value of `n`, while `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` retain their original values.
