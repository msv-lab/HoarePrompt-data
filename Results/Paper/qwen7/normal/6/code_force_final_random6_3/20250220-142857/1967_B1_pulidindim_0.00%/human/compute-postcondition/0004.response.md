Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is the second integer input split from `input().split()`, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
