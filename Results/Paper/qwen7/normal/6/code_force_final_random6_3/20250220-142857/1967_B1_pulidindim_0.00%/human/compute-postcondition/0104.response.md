Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to `m`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `n / count - (count - 1)`, `ans` is `ans + (n / (4 * count) - 3 / 5 + 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is `count - 1`. Therefore, the new value of `g` is `n / count - (count - 1)`. The values of `count`, `countmins`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
