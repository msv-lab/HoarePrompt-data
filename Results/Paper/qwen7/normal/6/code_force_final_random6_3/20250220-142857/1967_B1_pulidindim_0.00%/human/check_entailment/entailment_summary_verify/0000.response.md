### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare its logic with the problem statement and the provided examples.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates through values of \(b\) from 3 to \(m\) and updates a cumulative sum `ans` based on some arithmetic operations. Here is the relevant part of the code:
```python
count = 2
ans = n
while count <= m:
    countmins = count - 1
    g = n / count
    if g < countmins:
        break
    g -= countmins
    ans += g / count + 1
    count += 1
```

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The variable `count` starts at 2, but the problem requires \(1 \le b \le m\). Therefore, the loop should start from 1.
   - The variable `countmins` is calculated as `count - 1`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. It should be directly set to 1 since \(1 \le b \le m\).

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses `g = n / count`, which is not equivalent to \(\gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is incorrect. It should check the condition based on the actual \(\gcd(a, b)\) and the relationship between \(a + b\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Summation Logic**:
   - The summation logic `ans += g / count + 1` is not aligned with the problem requirements. It should increment `ans` based on the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops and the `math.gcd` function.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

#### Evaluation:
The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. After analyzing the provided program and the correct approach, we can see that the original assessment was accurate. The given program has significant logical errors and does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Final:
Final: **False**
