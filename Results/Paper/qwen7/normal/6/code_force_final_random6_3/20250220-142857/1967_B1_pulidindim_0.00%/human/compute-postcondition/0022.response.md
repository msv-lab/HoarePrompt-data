Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` must be greater than 3, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / 4 - countmins`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Since `countmins` is 0, `g` is updated to `n / 4 - 0`, which simplifies to `n / 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
