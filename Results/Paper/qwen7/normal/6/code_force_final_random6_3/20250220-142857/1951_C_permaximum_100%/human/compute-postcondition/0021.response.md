Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price` is `price + price_increase`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy < k`; `price` is increased by `price_increase`.**

In more natural language: The `price_increase` is added to the `price`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price` is `price + price_increase`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy < k`. The only change is that `price` is now `price + price_increase`.
