Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price, day` are the values popped from the heap.**

In more natural language: The `price` and `day` values are popped from the heap `pq`. The `total_cost` is increased by the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy`. The heap `pq` now has one less element. The variable `tickets_bought` is updated to its current value plus `tickets_to_buy`. The `price_increase` is updated to its current value plus `tickets_to_buy`. The `tickets_to_buy` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `tickets_bought` remain unchanged from their initial states.
