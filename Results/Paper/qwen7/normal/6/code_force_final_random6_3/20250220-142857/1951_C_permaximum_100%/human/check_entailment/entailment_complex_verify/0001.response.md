### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices. This part is handled accurately.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and their corresponding indices. This is done using `heapq.heapify`, which is appropriate for finding the minimum cost.

3. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to keep buying tickets until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. This is a correct approach.
   - For each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, adjusts the price by adding `price_increase`, and calculates how many tickets can be bought (`tickets_to_buy`). This is also correct.
   - It then updates the total cost and increases the `price_increase` accordingly. This is correct as well.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of tickets to buy exceeds the number of available tickets in a single day by limiting the number of tickets to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. This is a good edge case handling.
   - The logic ensures that the price increase is applied correctly after purchasing tickets on a particular day. This is also correct.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case. This is correct.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, we need to ensure that the program correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets to buy exceeds the number of available tickets in a single day. Specifically, we need to verify if the program correctly handles the situation when the remaining tickets to buy are less than `m`.

Consider the following scenario:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 5`
- `prices = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

The correct sequence of operations would be:
1. Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at price 1, total cost = 2, `price_increase` = 2, remaining tickets to buy = 3.
2. Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at price 3 (increased by 2), total cost = 2 + 2*3 = 8, `price_increase` = 4, remaining tickets to buy = 1.
3. Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at price 5 (increased by 4), total cost = 8 + 1*5 = 13.

The program correctly handles this scenario, but let's verify the general logic.

Upon re-evaluating the logic, we see that the program correctly implements the logic for buying tickets and updating the price increase. The program ensures that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed `m` and that the price increase is correctly applied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given conditions.

### Final:
**True**
