Output State: `total_cost` is the sum of `price * tickets_to_buy` for each iteration until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, `pq` is an empty heap (since all elements are processed), `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `price_increase` is the cumulative increase in price over all iterations, `price` is the final price after all increments, `day` is the last day's value popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought` during the last iteration, and `pq` is an empty heap because it has been fully processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_cost` will be the total expenditure to buy `k` tickets considering the price increases each day, `pq` will be empty as all elements were processed, `tickets_bought` will equal `k` indicating all required tickets have been bought, and `price_increase` will reflect the total increment in ticket price throughout the process.
