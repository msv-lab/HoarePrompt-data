Output State: **`total_cost` is now `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`; `price` is `price + price_increase`; `day` is the day popped from the heap; `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`; `pq` is a heap with one less element; `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days; `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.**

Explanation: The code `tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy` updates the value of `tickets_bought` by adding `tickets_to_buy` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
