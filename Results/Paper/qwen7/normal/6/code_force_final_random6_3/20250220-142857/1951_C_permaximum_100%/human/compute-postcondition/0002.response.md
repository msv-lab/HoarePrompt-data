Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.**

Explanation: The code initializes `total_cost` to 0. It does not affect the values of `pq`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
