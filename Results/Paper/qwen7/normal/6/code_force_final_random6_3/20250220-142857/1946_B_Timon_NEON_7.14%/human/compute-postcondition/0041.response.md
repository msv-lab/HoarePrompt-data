Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(arr)`.

3. **Analyze the given states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_sum` remains -1 (unchanged)
   - `new_segment` becomes either `[arr[3], 3]` or `[arr[4] + arr[2], 2]`
   - `max_segment` becomes either `[1 + arr[1], 0]`, `[1 + arr[3], 0]`, or `[1 + arr[4], 0]`
   - `segments_variants` remains either `[0, 0, 2]`, `[new_segment + [2]]`, or an empty list
   - `i` becomes either 4 or 5
   - `arr` remains a non-empty list

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < len(arr)`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`.
   - Given that `i` can be either 4 or 5, the next value of `i` should be 5 (since 5 is the higher value and if it is less than `len(arr)`, the loop will continue).

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The states of `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `arr` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either [arr[3], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [1 + arr[1], 0], [1 + arr[3], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0], `segments_variants` remains either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], or an empty list, `i` is 5, and `arr` remains a non-empty list**.
