Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `arr` is a non-empty list, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.**

The code `new_segment = []` initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
