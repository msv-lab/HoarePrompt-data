Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2], 2]` or an empty list, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This operation updates the value of `new_segment` while keeping all other variables unchanged.
