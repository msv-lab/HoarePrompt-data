Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the entire array, as this will maximize the sum.
   - The sum of the array can be calculated directly and then multiplied by \(2^k\) to account for the `k` operations.
   - The sum of the array needs to be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the number of operations (`k`).
   - It reads the array elements.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment sum, which seems unnecessary given the problem's solution strategy.
   - It calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It calls `func_1` to ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation.
   - `func_2` attempts to find the maximum segment sum but is overly complex and not necessary for the solution. The maximum segment sum is effectively the sum of the entire array if all elements are non-negative or the largest positive segment if there are negative elements.
   - Given the problem's constraints and the optimal strategy, `func_2` is redundant and can be simplified.

5. **Simplification**:
   - Instead of calling `func_2`, we can directly compute the sum of the array and use the formula `sum(a) * 2 ** k % (10^9 + 7)`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation is unnecessarily complex but still works correctly for the given problem constraints.
   - The core logic of the program is sound and achieves the desired result.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy of repeatedly inserting the sum of the entire array and handles the modulo operation appropriately. The complexity introduced by `func_2` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
