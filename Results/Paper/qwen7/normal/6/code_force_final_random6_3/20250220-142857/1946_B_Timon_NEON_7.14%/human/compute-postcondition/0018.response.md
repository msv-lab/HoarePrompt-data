Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is [1, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `arr` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increases the first element of `new_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. Since `i` is initially 2, the first element of `new_segment` is increased by `arr[2]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
