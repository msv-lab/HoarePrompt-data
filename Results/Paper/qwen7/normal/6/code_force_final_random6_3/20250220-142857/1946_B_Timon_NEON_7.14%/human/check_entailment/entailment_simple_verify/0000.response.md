### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007
```
- This function correctly computes the remainder when the input number is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary to ensure the result fits within the required modulo constraint.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
    
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
    
    if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    return total_max_segment
```
- The function `func_2` aims to find the maximum sum subarray in the array `arr`. However, it does not handle the insertion of sums into the array. Instead, it only finds the maximum sum subarray and returns its start and end indices along with the sum.
- The logic inside the function is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of inserting multiple sums into the array to maximize the final sum. For example, it does not account for the scenario where inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can lead to a higher overall sum.

#### Function `func_3`:
```python
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
```
- This function is incomplete and does not provide any functionality related to the problem. It simply initializes `answer` to 0 without any further computation.

### Evaluation:
- **Function `func_1`**: Correctly handles the modulo operation.
- **Function `func_2`**: Incorrectly implemented; it only finds the maximum sum subarray but does not handle the insertion of sums.
- **Function `func_3`**: Incomplete and irrelevant to the problem.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
