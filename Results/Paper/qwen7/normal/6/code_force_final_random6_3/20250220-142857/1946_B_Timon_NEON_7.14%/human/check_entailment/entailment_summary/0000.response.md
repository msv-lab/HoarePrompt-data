Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the largest possible subarray sums.
   - The `func_2` function finds the segment with the maximum sum in the array.
   - The `func_1` function returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` correctly identifies the segment with the maximum sum.
   - It handles both positive and negative segments appropriately.
   - It considers the entire array as a potential segment.

4. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` correctly returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Analysis of the Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula accounts for the maximum sum segment being added `2^k` times and the rest of the array sum being adjusted accordingly.
   - The result is then processed by `func_1` to ensure it is within the required modulo.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, setting it to zero is appropriate since adding a negative sum would decrease the overall sum.
   - The logic handles the case where no valid segment is found by returning `[-1]`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
