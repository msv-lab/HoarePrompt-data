Postcondition: `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either [arr[5], 5] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [1 + arr[3], 0], [1 + arr[4], 0], or [1 + arr[5], 0], `segments_variants` remains either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], or an empty list, `i` is 6, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.
