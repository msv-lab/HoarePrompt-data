Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: 
   - `func_3` is defined but not implemented. This function is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after performing `k` operations. However, it is currently empty and does not contain any logic to compute the result.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but its implementation is flawed. It does not correctly handle the logic for finding the maximum sum subarray and does not incorporate the ability to add sums of subarrays into the array.
   - The function `func_2` is not designed to solve the problem as stated. It seems to be trying to find the maximum sum subarray, which is not sufficient for the problem's requirements.

3. **Missing Main Logic**:
   - The main logic required to solve the problem is missing. Specifically, the program should:
     - Calculate the initial sum of the array.
     - Determine how to use the `k` operations to maximize the sum.
     - Handle edge cases and ensure the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the provided code cannot be considered correct for the given problem.
