Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the optimal strategy is to maximize the sum of the array by repeatedly adding the largest possible positive subarray sums. This is achieved by identifying the maximum sum subarray and then multiplying its sum by \(2^k\) and adding the sum of the original array minus the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2**: This function correctly identifies the maximum sum subarray. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the current segment sum and updating the maximum segment sum found so far. It handles both positive and negative segments appropriately.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code and is not relevant to the solution.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly uses `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it applies `func_1` to ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like empty subarrays and negative sums correctly.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the analysis, the program logic and the functions are consistent with the problem requirements and handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
