Output State: **`total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`; `segment` retains its original values.**

Explanation: The line `total_max_segment = segment` assigns the entire `segment` list to `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` now holds the same elements as `segment`. The initial condition that the first element of `total_max_segment` was less than the first element of `segment` is no longer true since they are now the same list. However, the problem does not ask to change the initial condition, so we only update `total_max_segment` to reflect its new assignment.
