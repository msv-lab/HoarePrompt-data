Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list where the first element is `arr[4] + arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either [1 + arr[1], 0] or [1 + arr[3], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2]]` or an empty list, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increases the first element of `new_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, the first element of `new_segment` is updated to `arr[4] + arr[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
