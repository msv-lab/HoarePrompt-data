Postcondition: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2], 2]` or an empty list, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It indicates that regardless of whether the condition `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is true or false, the final state of the variables will conform to the specified conditions.
