You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])

    #State: Output State: `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either an empty list, [arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], n-1], [arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 2], [arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 5], or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [2 + arr[1] + arr[3] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [2 + arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[1] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[4] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0] or [1 + arr[3], 0], `segments_variants` becomes a list containing all possible valid segment variants found during the loop execution, `i` is n (where n is the length of `arr`), and `arr` remains a non-empty list.
    #
    #This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `max_segment` will hold the maximum sum of any subarray encountered during the loop, and `segments_variants` will contain all such subarrays that had the maximum sum. The `new_segment` and `max_sum` will reflect the last state of the algorithm as it processes the entire array `arr`.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `total_max_segment` is the list with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`, and `segment` is the last element in `segments_variants`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from all the segments considered in `segments_variants`. The variable `segment` will be the last segment evaluated in the loop, which, in this case, would be the last element in the `segments_variants` list since the loop updates `total_max_segment` whenever it finds a segment with a higher sum. All other variables remain unchanged from their final states after the third iteration.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `total_max_segment` is the list with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`, and `segment` is the last element in `segments_variants`. If `len(total_max_segment)` equals 1, then `total_max_segment` is [-1].
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns the list `total_max_segment` which contains the segment with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is set to [-1]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns a list `total_max_segment` containing the segment with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is set to [-1].

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `total_max_segment` which contains the segment with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is set to [-1]


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
