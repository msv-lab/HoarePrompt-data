Output State: **`max_segment` becomes either [arr[3], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2]; `new_segment` becomes either [arr[3], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2]; `max_sum` remains -1; `segments_variants` becomes either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], or an empty list plus `[new_segment + [4]]`; `i` is 6; `arr` remains a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The line `max_segment = new_segment` updates `max_segment` to be equal to `new_segment`. Since `new_segment` can be either `[arr[3], 3]` or `[arr[4] + arr[2], 2]`, `max_segment` will also take on one of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
