### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is likely intended to handle the final result, but it does not contribute to solving the main problem.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function aims to find the maximum sum segment in the array. However, it does not actually perform any operations to insert the sum of the segment back into the array. Instead, it returns a list containing the start and end indices of the maximum sum segment found so far.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the context of the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any meaningful operations.

3. **Function Summaries**:
   - **Function 1**: Returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Function 2**: Returns a list of indices indicating the start and end of the maximum sum segment.
   - **Function 3**: Sets `answer` to 0 but does not return any value.

Given the above analysis, the code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not handle the core requirement of inserting the sum of selected subarrays back into the array to maximize the final sum. `func_1` only handles the modulo operation for the final result, which is not sufficient.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.
