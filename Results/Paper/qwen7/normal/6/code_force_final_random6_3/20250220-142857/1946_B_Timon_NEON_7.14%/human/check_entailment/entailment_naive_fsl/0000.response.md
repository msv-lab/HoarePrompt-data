Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main task of performing the specified operations to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.

- `func_1` simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
- `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum segment in the array but does not handle the insertion of sums into the array. It also does not account for the possibility of inserting multiple sums in different positions to maximize the final array sum.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not provide any functionality related to the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
