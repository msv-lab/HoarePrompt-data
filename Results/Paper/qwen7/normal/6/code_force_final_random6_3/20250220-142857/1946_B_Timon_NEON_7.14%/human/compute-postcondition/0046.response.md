Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_segment` becomes either [1 + arr[1], 0], [1 + arr[3], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0], `segments_variants` becomes either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], [max_segment + [4]], or an empty list plus [new_segment + [4]], `i` is 6, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` assigns an empty list to `new_segment`. This changes the value of `new_segment` from its previous state (either [arr[3], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2]) to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
