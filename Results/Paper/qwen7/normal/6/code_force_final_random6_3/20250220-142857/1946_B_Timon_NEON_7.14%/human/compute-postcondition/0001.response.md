The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer representing the sum of the original array, and `quantity`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations (k). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. Based on the parameters, it seems the function might modify or process these values in some way, but the exact operation is not specified.
