Output State: `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either an empty list, [arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], n-1], [arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 2], [arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 5], or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [2 + arr[1] + arr[3] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [2 + arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[1] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[4] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0] or [1 + arr[3], 0], `segments_variants` becomes a list containing all possible valid segment variants found during the loop execution, `i` is n (where n is the length of `arr`), and `arr` remains a non-empty list.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `max_segment` will hold the maximum sum of any subarray encountered during the loop, and `segments_variants` will contain all such subarrays that had the maximum sum. The `new_segment` and `max_sum` will reflect the last state of the algorithm as it processes the entire array `arr`.
