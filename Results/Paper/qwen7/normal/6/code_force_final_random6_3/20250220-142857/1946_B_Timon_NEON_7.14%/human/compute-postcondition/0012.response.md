Output State: **`max_segment` is `new_segment`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_segment` to the value of `new_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
