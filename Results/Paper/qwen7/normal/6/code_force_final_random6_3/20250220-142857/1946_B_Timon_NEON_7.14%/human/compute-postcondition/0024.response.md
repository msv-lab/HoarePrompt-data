Output State: **`max_segment` is now `[arr[1], 0]`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, `max_segment` is `[arr[1], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. Initially, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, and `i` is 1, so `max_segment[0]` (which is 0) is updated to `arr[1]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
