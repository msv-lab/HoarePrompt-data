Postcondition: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `arr[i] >= 0` is true, then `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `i` are updated as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is false.
