Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, `i` is 1, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the new segment extended by the index `i - 1` to the `segments_variants` list. Since `i` was initially 0, `i - 1` evaluates to -1, but since `new_segment` is a non-empty list, the appended element will be `[new_segment[0], -1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
