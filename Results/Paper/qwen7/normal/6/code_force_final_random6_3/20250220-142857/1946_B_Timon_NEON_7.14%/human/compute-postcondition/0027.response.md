Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` is being incremented in each iteration of the loop. The loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is -1
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`
   - `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1, 0]` or `[arr[1], 0]`
   - `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` or an empty list
   - `i` is either 2 or 3
   - `arr` is a non-empty list

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 2, then the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - If `i` was 3, then the loop will terminate because `range(len(arr))` will stop at `len(arr) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is being incremented, if `i` was 2, it will become 3.
   - If `i` was 3, the loop will terminate.

Given the current state, let's assume `i` was 2 (since it could also be 3 but the loop would terminate in that case):

- `max_sum` remains -1
- `new_segment` remains as it was (either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`)
- `max_segment` remains as it was (either `[0, 0]` or `[1, 0]` or `[arr[1], 0]`)
- `segments_variants` remains as it was (a list containing `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` or an empty list)
- `i` becomes 3
- `arr` remains a non-empty list

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (if `i` was 2) should be:

State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] or [arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2]]` or an empty list, `i` is 3, `arr` is a non-empty list**
