Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either [arr[3], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [1 + arr[1], 0], [1 + arr[3], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0], `segments_variants` becomes either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], or an empty list plus `[max_segment + [4]]`, `i` is 6, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Given that `i` was 5 before the code execution, `i - 1` evaluates to 4. Therefore, the new segment added to `segments_variants` is `max_segment + [4]`. The values of `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `arr` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new segment to `segments_variants`.
