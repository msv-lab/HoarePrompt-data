Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged. The input function waits for user input, which is then converted to an integer using `int()`. Therefore, `n` is now an integer that holds the value of the user's input, while `start`, `end`, and `t` retain their original conditions and values.
