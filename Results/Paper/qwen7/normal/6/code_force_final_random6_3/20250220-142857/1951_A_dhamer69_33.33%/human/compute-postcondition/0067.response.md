Output State: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`; `t` is `0`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be `0` since it is decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The values of `n` and `s` will be the last inputs provided by the user during the loop's final iteration, and `count_1` will be the count of '1's in the string `s` from that last iteration.
