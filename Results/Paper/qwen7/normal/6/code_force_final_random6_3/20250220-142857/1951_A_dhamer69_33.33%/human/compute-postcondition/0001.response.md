Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is an input integer.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an input integer, but we don't know its exact value yet.

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
