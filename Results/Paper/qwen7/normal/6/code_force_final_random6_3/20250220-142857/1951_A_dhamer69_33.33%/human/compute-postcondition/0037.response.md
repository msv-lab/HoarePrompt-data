Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'.
- If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s` and `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. Since there are no variables or objects that need to be evaluated or substituted, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
