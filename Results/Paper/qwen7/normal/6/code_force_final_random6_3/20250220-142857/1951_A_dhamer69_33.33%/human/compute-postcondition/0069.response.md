Functionality: **The function processes multiple inputs where each input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It checks specific conditions on `s` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 2, it checks if `s` is exactly "00". For other values of `n`, it counts the number of '1's in `s` and checks if the count is odd or if there is only one occurrence of "11". Based on these conditions, it prints either "YES" or "NO". After processing all inputs, the function ensures that the counter `t` is set to 0.**
