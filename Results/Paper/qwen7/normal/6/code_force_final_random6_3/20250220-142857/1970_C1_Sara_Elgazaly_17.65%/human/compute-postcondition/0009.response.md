Output State: **`x` must be at least 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a, b]`**.

Explanation: The code `lst[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the list `lst`. Given the initial state where `lst[b]` contains the value `[b]`, after executing the code, `lst[b]` will contain `[b, a]`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
