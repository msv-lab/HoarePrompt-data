Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is the same as `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and the first element of `lst[y]` is not an empty list, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This means that `lst[x]` is now an empty list, and `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
