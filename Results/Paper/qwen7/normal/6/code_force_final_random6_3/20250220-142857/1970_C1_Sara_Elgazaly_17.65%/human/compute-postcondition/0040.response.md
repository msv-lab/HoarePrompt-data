The loop condition is `lst[x] != []`, which means the loop continues as long as `lst[x]` is not an empty list. At the end of the previous iteration, `lst[x]` is an empty list. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[x]` must not be an empty list.

Let's break down the relevant states:

- `s` is False
- `x` is equal to `y`
- `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user
- `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`
- `lst[x]` is now an empty list

To make `lst[x]` not an empty list, we need to ensure that `lst[x]` is not empty before the loop starts. Since `lst[x]` is currently an empty list, we need to change this state.

State: **`s` is False, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is no longer an empty list**
