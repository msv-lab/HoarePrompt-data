Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the final popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `s = not s` changes the value of `s` from `False` to `True` because the initial state of `s` is `False`. All other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, `y`, and `lst[x]`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, the updated state of `s` is `True`, while `x` is still equal to `y`, `a` and `b` remain as the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the final popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is now an empty list.
