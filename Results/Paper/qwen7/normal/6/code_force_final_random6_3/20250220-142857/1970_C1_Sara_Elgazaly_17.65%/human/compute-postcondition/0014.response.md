Output State: The loop will execute `x-1` times in total. After all iterations, `x` must be at least the number of iterations plus one (i.e., `x` must be at least `n+1` since the loop runs `x-1` times and `x` starts from an integer value). The variable `a` and `b` will hold the values entered by the user during each iteration. The list `lst[b]` will contain a list of integers representing the nodes connected to node `b`, with each node being added twice (once for each edge connecting them) until the loop completes.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `x` will be the total number of inputs provided minus one. The list `lst[b]` will contain a series of integers representing the connections between nodes based on the inputs given, with each connection listed twice due to bidirectional edges.
