Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the list `lst`. Initially, `lst[b]` contained the value `b`. After executing the code, `lst[b]` will contain `[b, a]` since the append operation adds `a` as a new element to the existing list at index `b`. However, since the initial state only mentions that `lst[b]` contains `b`, and no list is explicitly defined, we assume `lst[b]` was a single value `b` before the append operation. After the operation, `lst[b]` becomes a list containing `[b, a]`.
