The function constructs an undirected graph using a dictionary where each key represents a node and its value is a list of nodes connected to it. It then traverses the graph starting from the node `x` until all nodes are visited, toggling a boolean flag `s` with each traversal. Finally, it prints either "Hermione" or "Ron" based on the state of `s` after the traversal. The function does not return any value but prints "Ron" in all cases.
