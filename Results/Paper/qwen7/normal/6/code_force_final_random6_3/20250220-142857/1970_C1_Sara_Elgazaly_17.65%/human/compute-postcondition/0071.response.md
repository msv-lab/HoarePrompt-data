Postcondition: `s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` contains at least one element before the pop operation; if `lst[y]` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
