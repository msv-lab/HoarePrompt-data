Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`, `q2` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `q2` by 1. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, `i` remains `n - 3`, `n` remains greater than 2, `k` remains updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `y[i]` remains assigned the value of `k`.
