Postcondition: `k` is updated based on either `k * a[q2] % m` with `q2` incremented by 1 or `k * a[q1] % m` with `q1` decreased by 1; `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`; `i` is `i-1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`; `n` remains greater than or equal to 2; the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false; `q2` is incremented by 1 if `t[i] == 'R'`, otherwise `q1` is decreased by 1.
