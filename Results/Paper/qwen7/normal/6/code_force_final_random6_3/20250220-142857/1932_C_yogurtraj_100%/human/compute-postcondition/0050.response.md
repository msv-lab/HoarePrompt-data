Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be -1 after the loop completes, indicating all iterations have been executed.
- `k` holds the final value after all multiplications and mod operations within the loop.
- The list `y` contains the values of `k` for each iteration, starting from the last index down to the second index, with `y[-1]` being set to `k` in the last iteration.

Given this, the `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y`, which contains the sequence of values of `k` from the last iteration to the second iteration.

Output: **[k, k, ..., k] (where k is the final value of k after all iterations of the loop)**
