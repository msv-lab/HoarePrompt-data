Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the count of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1**.

Explanation: The code `q2 = l + 1` updates the value of `q2` to be `l + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
