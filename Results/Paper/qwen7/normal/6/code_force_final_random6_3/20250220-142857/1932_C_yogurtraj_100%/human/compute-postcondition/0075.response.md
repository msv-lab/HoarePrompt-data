Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, and `t[i]` is not equal to 'R', `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is `q1 - 1`**.

The value of `q1` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `q1` before the decrement is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
