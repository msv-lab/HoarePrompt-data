Output State: **`k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`, `q1` is decreased by 1, `i` is `i-1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 2, the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false.**

This means that the value of `k` is now updated to the result of `k * a[q1] % m`. The value of `y[i]` is set to the new value of `k`. The index `q1` is decremented by 1, and `i` is decremented by 1, ensuring it remains non-negative. The conditions related to `n`, `t[i+1]`, and the relationship between `q2` and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
