Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, a list of n integers a, an integer m, and a string s of length n. t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, n and m are positive integers with n ranging from 1 to 2â‹…10^5 and m from 1 to 10^4. The array a contains n integers each between 1 and 10^4. The string s consists of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input according to the given constraints.**
