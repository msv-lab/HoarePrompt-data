Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The variables `ii` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `m` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, `ii` is still 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, and `a` is a list containing the integers from the input split by spaces.
