Postcondition: `i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, `n` is greater than 2, `q1` and `q2` are updated accordingly, `k` is updated to either `k * a[q2] % m` (if `t[i] == 'R'`) or `k * a[q1] % m` (if `t[i] != 'R'`), and `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`. If `t[i] == 'R'`, `q2` is increased by 1; otherwise, `q1` is decreased by 1.
