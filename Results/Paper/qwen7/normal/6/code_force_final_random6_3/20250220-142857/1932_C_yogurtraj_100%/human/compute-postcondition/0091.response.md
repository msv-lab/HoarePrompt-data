Output State: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, `n` is greater than 2, `q1` is decreased by 1, `q2` is updated accordingly, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k * a[q1] % m`.**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decreases the value of `q1` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `q2`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
