Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \), the modulus \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( t \) of length \( n \) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of values based on the direction indicated by 'L' and 'R' in \( t \) and stores these values in a list \( y \). The final list \( y \) is printed, where each element \( y[i] \) represents the product of certain elements in \( a \) modulo \( m \), depending on the direction specified by \( t \).**
