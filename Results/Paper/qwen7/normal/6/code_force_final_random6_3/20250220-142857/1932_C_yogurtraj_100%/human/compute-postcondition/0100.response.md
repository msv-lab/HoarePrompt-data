Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, and the values of `q1` and `q2`, `k`, and `y` are undefined.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial values of `i` and `n` being greater than 2 remain unchanged. The values of `q1`, `q2`, `k`, and `y` are not affected by this line of code and are therefore undefined.
