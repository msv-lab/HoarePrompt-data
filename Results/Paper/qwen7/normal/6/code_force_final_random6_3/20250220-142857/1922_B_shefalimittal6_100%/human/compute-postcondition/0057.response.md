Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i] >= 2`, plus the sum of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i] >= 3`, `cnt` is equal to `n + 1`, `idx` is 3 + n, `i` is `n + 1`, and `results` contains a single string element which is the str representation of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `ans` to the `results` list as a string. This does not change the value of `ans`, `cnt`, `idx`, or `i`. The value of `results` now contains one string element which is the string representation of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
