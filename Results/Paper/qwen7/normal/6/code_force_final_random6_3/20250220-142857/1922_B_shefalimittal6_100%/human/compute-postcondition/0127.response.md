Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `idx` is `n + 1`, each element in `v` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `t` is decremented by `n`, and `results` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. However, since `ans` was not previously defined in the initial state, it does not affect the existing variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `cnt`, `idx`, each element in `v`, `n`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.
