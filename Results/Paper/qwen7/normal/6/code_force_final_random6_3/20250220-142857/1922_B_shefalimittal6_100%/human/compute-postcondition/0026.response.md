Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `idx` is 3 + n.
   - `cnt` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(n + 1)` requires `n` to be at least 0).
   - The initial value of `i` is 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is a non-negative integer and `i` is set to its initial value of 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 0, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**
