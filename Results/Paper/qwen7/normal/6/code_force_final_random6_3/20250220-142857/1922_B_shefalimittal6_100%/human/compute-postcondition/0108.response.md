Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop variable is an underscore `_` (a dummy variable) and the loop runs `t` times.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop variable `_` is a dummy variable, it does not affect the state of any other variables.
   - The only relevant variables affected by the loop are `results`, `cnt`, and `ans`.

3. **Analyze the Effects of Each Iteration:**
   - `results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it.
   - `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`.
   - `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it.
   - `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`.
   - `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - After the previous iteration, `t` is reduced by 1.
   - Therefore, `t` must be `t - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state adjustments for the next iteration are:

- `t` is reduced by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
- `results`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range, and `t` is `t - 1`**.
