Output State: **`i` is in the range `[0, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Since `v[i]` is initially greater than or equal to 2, the updated value of `ans` includes the previous increment (`cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`) plus the new increment (`v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`). All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
