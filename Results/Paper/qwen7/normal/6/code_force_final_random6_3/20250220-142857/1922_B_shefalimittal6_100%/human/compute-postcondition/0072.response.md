Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 2; `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx-1]`; `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `idx` was initially incremented by 1, after this line, `idx` is incremented by 2 in total. The value of `x` is still assigned the value of `data[idx]`, but since `idx` has now been incremented by 1 more time, `x` is now assigned the value of `data[idx-1]`. The condition that `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
