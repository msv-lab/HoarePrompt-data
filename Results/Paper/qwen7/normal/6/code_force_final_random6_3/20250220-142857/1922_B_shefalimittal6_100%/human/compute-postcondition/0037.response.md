Output State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. Given the initial state, `v[i]` is now `v[1]` which is 1. So, `cnt` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to 1. The other variables (`ans`, `idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3 is false, `ans` is updated according to the condition provided, which adds `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6` to the existing value of `ans`.
