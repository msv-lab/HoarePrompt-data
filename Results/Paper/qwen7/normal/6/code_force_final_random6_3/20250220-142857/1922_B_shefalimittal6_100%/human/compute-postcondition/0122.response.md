Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `idx` is not provided initially. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `idx` is increased by 1.
