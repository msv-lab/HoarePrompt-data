Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
