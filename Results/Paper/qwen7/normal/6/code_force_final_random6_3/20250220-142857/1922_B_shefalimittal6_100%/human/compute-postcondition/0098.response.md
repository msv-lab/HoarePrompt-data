Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[2, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is in the range `[2, n + 1)` and `v[i + 1]` is not considered in the current line of code.**

The code `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value. The other conditions and the value of `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ans` and the unchanged states of `cnt`, `i`, `n`, and the condition for `v[i + 1]` which is not evaluated in this line of code.
