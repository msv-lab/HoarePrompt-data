Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1**

The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. However, the initial values or expressions for `v`, `x`, `n`, and `idx` are not provided. Therefore, we can only state that `v[x]` is increased by 1. The conditions and previous states of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged.
