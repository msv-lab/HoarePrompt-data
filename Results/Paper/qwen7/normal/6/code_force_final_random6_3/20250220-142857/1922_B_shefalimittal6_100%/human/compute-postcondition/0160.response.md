Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list of non-negative integers a where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the given test cases, where the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It processes these inputs and produces an output based on the specified conditions, without directly accepting any parameters within its definition.
