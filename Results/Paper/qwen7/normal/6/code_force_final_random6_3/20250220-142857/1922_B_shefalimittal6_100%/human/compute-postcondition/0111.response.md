Output State: **`data[idx]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, `results` contains a string representation of `ans` appended to it, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `data[idx]`, `n`, `results`, `cnt`, `ans`, `t`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and the new state of `v` is described as above.
