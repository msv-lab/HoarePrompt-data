Output State: `idx` is increased by `n`; `v[x]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx-1]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations executed, which is the length of `data` minus the initial `idx` value.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be equal to the initial `idx` plus the total number of iterations (`n`), `v[x]` will have been incremented for each element in `data` that was processed, and `n` will be at least as large as the number of elements processed, ensuring the loop ran the required number of times.
