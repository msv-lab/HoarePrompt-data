Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n)`. The only variable involved here is `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`idx` and `v[x]`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `n` must remain greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again, we keep this condition as it is. The other states (`idx` and `v[x]`) are not part of the loop head and hence do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
