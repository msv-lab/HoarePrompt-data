Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[0, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increases the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. The conditions related to `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
