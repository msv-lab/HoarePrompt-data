Output State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2 + v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, if `v[3]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt` is incremented by `v[3]`. Since `cnt` was initially 1, after the increment, `cnt` becomes 2. All other variables (`ans`, `idx`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
