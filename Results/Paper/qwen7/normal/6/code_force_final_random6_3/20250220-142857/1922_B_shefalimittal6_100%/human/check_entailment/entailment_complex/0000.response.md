Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case as described in the problem statement.
2. It initializes an array `v` to count the occurrences of each possible stick length (from 0 to \( n \)).
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to form a triangle using the formula derived from combinatorial mathematics:
   - Triangles with two sides having the same length: \( \text{cnt} \times v[i] \times (v[i] - 1) // 2 \)
   - Triangles with all three sides having the same length: \( v[i] \times (v[i] - 1) \times (v[i] - 2) // 6 \)
4. The variable `cnt` keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks seen so far, which is used in the calculation for triangles with two sides having the same length.
5. The final result for each test case is stored in the `results` list, and the results are printed correctly.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the program, it accurately follows the problem's requirements and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
