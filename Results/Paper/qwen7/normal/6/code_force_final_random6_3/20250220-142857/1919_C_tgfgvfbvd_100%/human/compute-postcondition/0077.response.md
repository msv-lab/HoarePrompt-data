Output State: **`a` is the value of `l[x]`, `b` is infinity, `c` is either 2 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was either 0 or 1 initially, it now becomes either 1+1=2 or 0+1=1. The values of `a`, `b`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged.
