Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `x` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will be the minimum value found in the list `l`, `b` will be the second smallest value found in the list `l`, and `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than `b`. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

In more detail:
- `x` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- `a` will hold the minimum value from the list `l` because any value less than or equal to `a` replaces `a`, and `a` is set to `b` when `a` is not greater than `b`.
- `b` will hold the second smallest value from the list `l` because it is updated only when `l[x]` is between `a` and `b`.
- `c` will count how many times `a` is replaced by `l[x]` (i.e., how many elements are strictly greater than `b`), which happens whenever `l[x]` is greater than `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is the minimum value from the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest value from the list `l`, `c` is the count of unique elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`, and `n` is the length of the list `l`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will hold the smallest value in the list `l`, and `b` will hold the second smallest value. The variable `c` will count how many elements in the list are greater than both `a` and `b`. The values of `l`, `x`, and `n` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be equal to `n-1`, `a` will be the minimum value in the list `l`, `b` will be the second minimum value in the list `l` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise `b` will be positive infinity, and `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
