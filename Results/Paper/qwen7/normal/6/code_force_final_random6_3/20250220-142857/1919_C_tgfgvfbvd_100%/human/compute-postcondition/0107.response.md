Output State: **`x` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is now equal to `l[x]`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, and `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Since `x` is 0, `a` is now set to the value of `l[0]`. The other variables (`n`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
