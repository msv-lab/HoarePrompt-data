Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to split the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) does not ensure that the penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\) is minimized. The program attempts to find a way to split the array such that the maximum value between two consecutive elements is minimized, which is not equivalent to minimizing the penalty defined in the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct minimum penalty should be 1, as we can split the array into \(s = [1, 2]\) and \(t = [3, 4]\), resulting in penalties \(p(s) = 1\) and \(p(t) = 0\). However, the provided program might not find this optimal split and could instead produce a different result, leading to an incorrect penalty calculation.
