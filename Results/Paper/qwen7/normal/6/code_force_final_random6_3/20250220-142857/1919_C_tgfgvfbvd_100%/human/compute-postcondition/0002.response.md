Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
