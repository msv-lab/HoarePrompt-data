Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for x in range(n)`. The only variable here is `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `x` is 1
   - `a` is equal to the original value of `b`
   - `b` is either `l[1]` or the original value of `a`
   - `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is greater than `b` and `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is 2
   - `n` remains unchanged if `a` is not greater than `b`

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 2.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` do not change based on the loop head alone; they depend on the loop body, which is omitted. Therefore, these values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is either `l[1]` or the original value of `a`, `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is greater than `b` and `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged if `a` is not greater than `b`**
