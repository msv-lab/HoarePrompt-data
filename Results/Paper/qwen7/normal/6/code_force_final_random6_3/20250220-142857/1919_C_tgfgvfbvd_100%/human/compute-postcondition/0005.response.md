Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0.**

The code initializes `c` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `c` is updated to 0.
