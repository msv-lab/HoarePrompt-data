Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is now `l[1]`, `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is greater than `b`, and `n` remains unchanged if `a` is not greater than `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` (which is `l[1]` since `x` is 1) to `b`. The other variables (`a`, `c`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
