Output State: **`x` is 0, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `c` is 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `l[0]` is greater than `b`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Initially, `c` was not defined, so it is assumed to be 0. After executing the code, `c` becomes 1. All other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `l[0]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
