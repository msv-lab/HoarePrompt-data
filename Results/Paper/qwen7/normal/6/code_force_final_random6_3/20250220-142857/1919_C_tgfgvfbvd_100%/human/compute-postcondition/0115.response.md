Output State: **`x` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, and `c` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Initially, `c` was not defined, so it is assumed to be 0 (since no other value is given). After executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` becomes 1. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
