You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
    continue

def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer \( n \) and computes a sequence using a specific formula. After iterating through values up to \( n \), it returns the last element of the computed sequence, which is 1070834 for any valid input \( n \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic to update `n` (the size of the board) is incorrect. When a move is made, the board size should be reduced by the number of unattacked rows and columns, not just by 2 or 1. The current implementation simply subtracts 2 or 1 from `n` without considering the actual reduction in available positions due to the placement of rooks.

For example, consider a 4x4 board with one move placed at (1, 2). The correct reduction would be to subtract 2 rows and 2 columns, leaving a 2x2 board. However, the current code only reduces `n` by 2, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of the attacked rows and columns and adjust the board size accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    attacked_rows = set()
    attacked_cols = set()
    
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        attacked_rows.add(a)
        attacked_cols.add(b)
    
    # Calculate the number of unattacked rows and columns
    unattacked_rows = n - len(attacked_rows)
    unattacked_cols = n - len(attacked_cols)
    
    # The final board size is the product of unattacked rows and columns
    final_board_size = unattacked_rows * unattacked_cols
    
    print(final_board_size % (10**9 + 7))
```

This corrected version properly accounts for the reduction in available positions and calculates the correct number of possible final configurations.
