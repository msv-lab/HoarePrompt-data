Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Adjustment of Chessboard Size**: The program correctly adjusts the size of the chessboard `n` by subtracting 2 for each non-diagonal move and subtracting 1 for each diagonal move. This ensures that the remaining valid positions on the board are accurately reflected in `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` computes the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The base case is initialized as `[1, 1]`, representing the number of configurations for a 1x1 and 2x2 board. The recurrence relation used is correct and matches the problem statement:
   - Each new element in the DP array is computed as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - The function correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow and ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Output**: The function returns the correct value for the number of possible final configurations, which is the last element of the DP array.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
