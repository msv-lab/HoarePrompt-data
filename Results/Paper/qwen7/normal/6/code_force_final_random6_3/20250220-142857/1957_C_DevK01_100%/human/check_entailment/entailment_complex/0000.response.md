### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of unique final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of valid moves where you and the computer place rooks alternately. Each move ensures no two rooks attack each other, and the computer mirrors your moves unless the coordinates are the same.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then processes each of the \( k \) moves, reducing the effective size of the board by 1 or 2 depending on whether the mirrored move is allowed.
   - Finally, it calls the function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1(n)` Analysis**:
   - The function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This relation is derived from combinatorial arguments and ensures that the number of configurations is correctly computed for each board size.
   - The function correctly initializes the base cases and iterates to compute the required value.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to handle the specific problem constraints and correctly computes the number of configurations.
   - The example provided in the problem statement matches the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1(n)` accurately computes the number of possible final configurations for the given board size \( n \).

**Correctness: True**
