Output State: `vals` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over; `den` is the final result obtained by successively applying the `func_1(den, x)` function to each element `x` in the original list `vals`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `vals` will be exhausted (i.e., it will be empty), and the variable `den` will hold the cumulative result of applying the `func_1` function to each element of the original list `vals`, starting with the initial value of `den`.
