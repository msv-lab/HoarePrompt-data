Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the coins in a way that ensures the total bet is less than the winnings for any winning outcome. However, the logic in `func_2` does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3
5 5 5
```

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributes the coins based on the LCM. For the input `5 5 5`, the LCM is 5. The program then prints `1 1 1`, which means betting 1 coin on each outcome. However, if the first outcome wins, you would get back `5 * 1 = 5` coins, which is not strictly greater than the total bet of `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` coins.

To ensure the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome, the program needs to find a distribution where the sum of the bets is less than the product of each multiplier and the corresponding bet. The current implementation does not guarantee this condition is met for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
