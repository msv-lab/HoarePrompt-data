Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program only partially addresses the problem. Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `den`:**
   - The variable `den` is initialized with the first value from the input list, which is not necessarily the correct denominator.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, but the logic to compute the LCM for all elements in the list is flawed. It should calculate the LCM of all elements, not just sequentially.

2. **Incorrect Distribution Logic:**
   - The logic to distribute the coins (`vprod`) is based on the LCM calculation, which might not correctly reflect the requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

3. **Missing Handling of Multiple Solutions:**
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple solutions exist, although the problem statement mentions that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that satisfies the constraints.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function to compute LCM of a list of numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_list(numbers):
    return reduce(lcm, numbers)

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve_test_case():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Calculate the LCM of all multipliers
    den = lcm_list(vals)
    
    # Distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM
    if den < min(vals):
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Distribute the coins
    result = [den // val for val in vals]
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())

for _ in range(T):
    solve_test_case()
```

This approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome, and it handles the LCM calculation correctly for all multipliers.
