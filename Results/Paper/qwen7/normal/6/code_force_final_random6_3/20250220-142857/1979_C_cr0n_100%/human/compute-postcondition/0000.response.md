Output State: **N is an input integer, 1 ≤ N ≤ 50**.

Explanation: The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial condition that `N` is an integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 50` remains valid, and the value of `N` is updated based on the user's input. The list `vals` is not affected by this code snippet.
