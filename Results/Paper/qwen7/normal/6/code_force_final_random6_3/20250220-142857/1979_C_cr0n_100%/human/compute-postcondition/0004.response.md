Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `vals`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `den` is the first element of the list `vals`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `den` is the first element of `vals`, `vals` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - We don't need to change `N` or `den` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `vals` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
