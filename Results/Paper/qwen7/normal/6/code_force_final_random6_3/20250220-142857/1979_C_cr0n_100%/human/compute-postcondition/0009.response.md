Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in vals`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `vals`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the next element in the list `vals`.
   - `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must still have at least one element.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `vals`.
   - `den` will be updated to the result of calling `func_1(den, x)` again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `vals` still has at least one element, `x` is now the next element in the list, and `den` is updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `x` is the next element in the list `vals`; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`**.

However, since `vals` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue, and `x` will be the next element, we can simplify the state to focus on what changes:

State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `x` is the next element in the list `vals`; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`**.

This state indicates that the loop can continue as long as `vals` has at least one element, and `x` and `den` are updated accordingly.
