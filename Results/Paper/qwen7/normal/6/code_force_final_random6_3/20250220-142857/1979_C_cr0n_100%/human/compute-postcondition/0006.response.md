Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in vals`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `vals`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `vals`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is being iterated over from the list `vals`, after each iteration, `x` takes the next value from `vals`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must still have at least one element left.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `den` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head and its value is determined by the function call `func_1(den, x)` which happens inside the loop body.
   - `vals` must have at least one element remaining for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`**.

However, to be more specific about the exact state at the start of the next iteration, we would need to know the exact value of `x` from the previous iteration and ensure that `vals` still has at least one element. But based on the given information, the general state remains the same.

So, the final state is:

**`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`**.
