Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `vals`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `den` is the first element of the list `vals`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `vals`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `vals` must contain at least one element. Since `den` is defined as the first element of `vals`, `vals` must have at least one element.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of each element in `vals` during each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `vals` must have at least one element.
- `x` will take the value of each element in `vals` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: `N` is an input integer, 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `den` is the first element of the list `vals`, and `x` will take the value of each element in `vals` during each iteration.**

However, since we are asked to focus on the loop head variables, the final answer will be:

**State: `x` will take the value of each element in `vals` during each iteration, `vals` must have at least one element.**
