Output State: **`N` is an input integer, 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code takes an input integer `N` (where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\)) and then splits the input into a list of integers. The variable `vals` is assigned a list comprehension that converts each element from the split input into an integer. The initial state of `N` remains unchanged, and a new list `vals` is created based on the input.
