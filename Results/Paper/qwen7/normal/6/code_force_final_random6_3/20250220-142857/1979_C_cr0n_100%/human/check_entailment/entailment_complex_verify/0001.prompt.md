You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3

    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Annotated Code:

cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 20 and gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range of 2 to 20 inclusive, and returns their least common multiple (LCM). This is calculated by dividing the product of `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, and vals is a list of N integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `vals` is an empty list or has no elements left to iterate over; `den` is the final result obtained by successively applying the `func_1(den, x)` function to each element `x` in the original list `vals`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `vals` will be exhausted (i.e., it will be empty), and the variable `den` will hold the cumulative result of applying the `func_1` function to each element of the original list `vals`, starting with the initial value of `den`.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `vals` is an empty list; `den` is `den - sum(vprod)`. `den` is greater than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: ' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]) (where vprod is a list of numbers whose sum is subtracted from den)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer \(N\) representing the size of the list, and the second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers. It then calculates a cumulative result using the `func_1` function on these integers, storing the result in `den`. After processing, it computes a new list `vprod` based on `den` and the original list `vals`. If `den` becomes less than or equal to zero after adjusting it with `vprod`, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string and returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The multipliers for the winnings are given as \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).

### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and processes it to find a valid distribution of coins.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
- **Reading Input**: It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
- **Calculating LCM**: It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
- **Distributing Coins**: It computes the required bet amounts for each outcome by dividing `den` by each multiplier. It then subtracts the sum of these bet amounts from `den` to get the remaining value.
- **Output**: If the remaining value is non-positive, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the bet amounts are distributed in a way that minimizes the total bet while ensuring the condition is met.
2. **Bet Distribution**: The bet amounts are correctly calculated as `den // r` for each multiplier \( r \). These amounts ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the winnings by checking if the remaining value after distributing the bets is non-positive.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: \( N = 3 \), multipliers \( [3, 2, 7] \)
  - LCM of \( 3, 2, 7 \) is \( 42 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 42 // 3 = 14 \), \( 42 // 2 = 21 \), \( 42 // 7 = 6 \).
  - Total bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \).
  - Winnings: \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \), \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \), \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \).
  - Condition satisfied: \( 41 < 42 \).

- **Test Case 2**: \( N = 2 \), multipliers \( [3, 3] \)
  - LCM of \( 3, 3 \) is \( 3 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \), \( 3 // 3 = 1 \).
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
  - Winnings: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \), \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \).
  - Condition satisfied: \( 2 < 3 \).

- **Test Case 3**: \( N = 5 \), multipliers \( [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - LCM of \( 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 \) is \( 5 \).
  - Bet amounts: \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \).
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).
  - Winnings: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \).
  - Condition not satisfied: \( 5 \not< 5 \).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins. However, it fails to handle cases where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`.
