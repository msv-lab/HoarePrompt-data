### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The solution involves finding a common denominator that ensures this condition holds for all multipliers.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \). It does so by dividing the product of \( a \) and \( b \) by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the input for each test case.
   - It initializes `den` with the first element of the list `vals`.
   - It iterates through the list `vals`, updating `den` by calculating the LCM of `den` and each element in `vals`.
   - After the loop, it computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - It then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`.
   - If `den` is non-positive, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the LCM of all multipliers, ensuring that the total bet is less than the potential winnings for any outcome.
   - The subtraction of the sum of `vprod` from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the potential winnings for any outcome.
   - The use of `vprod` ensures that the bet on each outcome is calculated correctly based on the LCM.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
