Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more lines of input left in the file. For each line, `s` will be the line of input, `n` will be the first integer split from `s`, and `k` will be the second integer split from `s`. After all iterations, the final output will consist of the results of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluated for each line of input.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the output will include the result of the given expression for every line of input provided, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`.
