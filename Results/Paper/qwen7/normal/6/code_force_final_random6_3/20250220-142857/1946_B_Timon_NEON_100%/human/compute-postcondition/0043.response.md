Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or a segment ending at some index i-1 based on the sum comparison, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
