### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`
This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is not used in the context of solving the problem and does not contribute to the solution. This part of the code is irrelevant to the main logic.

#### Function `func_2`
This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array multiple times. The logic inside the function is indeed flawed and does not handle the insertion of sums into the array as required. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**:
   - The function tries to identify segments where the sum is maximized, but it does not consider the possibility of inserting the sum of these segments back into the array. Instead, it only considers the sum of the segment up to the last element.
   - For example, if the array is \([-4, -7]\), the function will return \([0, 0]\) because it only considers the sum up to the last element, which is zero. However, the correct approach should allow inserting the sum of the entire array, which would be \(-11\).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Segment Identification**:
   - The function uses `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of segments, but it does not correctly update these variables to reflect the sum of the entire array or any subarray that could be inserted back into the array.

#### Function `func_3`
This function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the array sum through the specified operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem. It fails to handle the insertion of the sum of any subarray into the array and does not account for the required operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
