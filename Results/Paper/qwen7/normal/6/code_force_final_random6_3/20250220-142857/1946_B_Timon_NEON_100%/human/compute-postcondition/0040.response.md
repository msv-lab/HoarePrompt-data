Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or a segment ending at some index i-1 based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `new_segment`, which is now `[arr[i], i]`. This means the first element of `new_segment` is the current element from the array `arr` at index `i`, and the second element is the index `i`. The other variables (`segments_variants`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
