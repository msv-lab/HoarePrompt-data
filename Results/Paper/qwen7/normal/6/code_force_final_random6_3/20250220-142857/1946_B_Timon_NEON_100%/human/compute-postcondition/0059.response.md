Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list of segments, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is added to `segments_variants` as [arr[i], i] and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. If `arr[i] < 0`, `segments_variants` remains unchanged and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index.
