Postcondition: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element updated according to the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, and `len(arr)` is at least 1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` becomes an empty list and `max_segment` is updated as described. Otherwise, `new_segment` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to its first element, and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[i], arr[i]]`.
