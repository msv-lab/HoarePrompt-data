Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`. Specifically, if `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is updated according to the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` or to a segment ending at `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains unchanged. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not, and `max_sum` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is added to `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list of segments, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `segments_variants` now contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, depending on whether `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`; `max_segment` is updated to the better segment found (with its first element incremented by `arr[i]`); `new_segment` is an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index, with `new_segment[0]` increased by `arr[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
