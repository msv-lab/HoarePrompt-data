Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `max_segment` plus the element `len(arr) - 1` and a new list containing `len(arr) - 1`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` remains the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

This means that the `total_max_segment` variable has been initialized to the list `[-1]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
