Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, `max_sum` remains -1, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of the `max_segment` list by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
