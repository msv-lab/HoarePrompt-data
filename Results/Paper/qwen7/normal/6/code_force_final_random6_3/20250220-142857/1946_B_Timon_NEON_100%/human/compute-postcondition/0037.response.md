Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increases the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
