Postcondition: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or a segment ending at some index i-1 based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` is added to `segments_variants`.
