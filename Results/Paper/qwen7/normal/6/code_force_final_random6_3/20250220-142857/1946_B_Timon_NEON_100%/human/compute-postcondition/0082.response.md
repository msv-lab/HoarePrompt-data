Output State: `segments_variants` contains all the segments generated during the iterations; `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found throughout all iterations; `max_sum` remains -1 (indicating no valid segment was found that meets the criteria); `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `segments_variants` will include every segment variant generated during the process. The variable `new_segment` remains empty as it is only initialized and used within the loop but never assigned outside of it. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum encountered across all iterations. Since `max_sum` is initialized to -1 and only updated when a segment's sum exceeds the current `max_sum` and the segment has more than one element, `max_sum` will either remain -1 or be the sum of the `max_segment`. `total_max_segment` will be the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element, reflecting the best possible segment found according to the given condition.
