Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that we can achieve the maximum sum by repeatedly adding the largest positive subarray sums. This is because adding larger positive sums will contribute more to the overall sum than smaller ones.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the result fits within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it has some issues:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` incorrectly. `new_segment` should start as an empty list, and `max_segment` should be initialized as `[0, -1]` to handle edge cases.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` is flawed. It does not correctly track the maximum sum subarray.
     - The final return statement only returns the last segment, which may not be the maximum sum segment.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the solution. It is likely a placeholder or intended for a different part of the solution.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the maximum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose.
   - After finding the maximum sum subarray, we can add this sum `k` times to the original array sum, ensuring we do not exceed `k` operations.

Given the issues with `func_2`, the provided code is not correct for solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
