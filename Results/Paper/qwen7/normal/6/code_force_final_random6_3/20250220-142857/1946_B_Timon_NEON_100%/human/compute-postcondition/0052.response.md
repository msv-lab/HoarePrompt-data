Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, depending on whether `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`; `max_segment` is updated to the better segment found (with its first element incremented by `arr[i]`); `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
