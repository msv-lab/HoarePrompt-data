Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the subarray with the highest sum among those containing more than one element. It identifies all possible segments in the array, evaluates their sums, and selects the segment with the maximum sum that includes at least two elements. If no such segment exists, it returns a segment containing only the first element of the array.**
