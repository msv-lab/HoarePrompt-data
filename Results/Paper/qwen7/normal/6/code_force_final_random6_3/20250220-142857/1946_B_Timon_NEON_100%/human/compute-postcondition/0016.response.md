Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `len(arr)` is at least 1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. Since `arr[i]` is less than 0, the value of `max_segment[0]` will decrease. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
