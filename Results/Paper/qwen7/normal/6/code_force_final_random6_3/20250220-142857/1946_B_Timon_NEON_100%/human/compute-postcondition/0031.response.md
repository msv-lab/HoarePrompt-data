Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['max_segment + [i - 1]'], `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.**

Explanation: The line `segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `segments_variants`. This new element is the concatenation of `max_segment` and the list `[i - 1]`. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
