Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Understand the postconditions given:**
   - `segments_variants` is a list of segments.
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i]`.
   - `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison.
   - `max_sum` remains `-1`.

3. **Determine the changes made inside the loop:**
   - If `new_segment` is non-empty, it is added to `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is updated accordingly.
   - If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `segments_variants` may change if `new_segment` is non-empty.
   - `max_segment` may change if `new_segment` is non-empty or if `new_segment` is empty but `max_segment` needs to be updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, let's determine the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration).
- `segments_variants` will remain the same unless `new_segment` is non-empty, in which case it will be added to `segments_variants`.
- `max_segment` will remain the same unless `new_segment` is non-empty and updates `max_segment` or if `new_segment` is empty and updates `max_segment` based on the current element of `arr` and its index.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

The states at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `segments_variants` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `max_segment` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i_end + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i_end+1]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is added to `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is updated accordingly. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` remains unchanged, and `max_segment` is updated based on the current element of `arr` and its index. `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
