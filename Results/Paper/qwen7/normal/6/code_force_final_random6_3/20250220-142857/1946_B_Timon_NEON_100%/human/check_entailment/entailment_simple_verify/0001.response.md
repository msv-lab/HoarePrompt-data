### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The key insight is that we can achieve the maximum sum by repeatedly adding the largest positive subarray sums.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to identify the largest positive subarray sum and use it as many times as possible within the `k` operations.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the result fits within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it has significant issues:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` incorrectly. `new_segment` should start as an empty list, and `max_segment` should be initialized as `[0, -1]` to handle edge cases.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` is flawed. It does not correctly track the maximum sum subarray.
     - The final return statement only returns the last segment, which may not be the maximum sum segment.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the solution. It is likely a placeholder or intended for a different part of the solution.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the maximum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose.
   - After finding the maximum sum subarray, we can add this sum `k` times to the original array sum, ensuring we do not exceed `k` operations.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program at various points, but it does not fully address the issues in `func_2`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is still flawed, and it does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the issues with `func_2`, the provided code is not correct for solving the problem as stated. The logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect, and the final result is not guaranteed to be the maximum possible sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray, leading to an incorrect final result.
