Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_3` is incomplete and does not exist in the provided code. The solution requires calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations, which involves selecting contiguous subarrays, computing their sums, and inserting these sums into the array. The given code does not address this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
