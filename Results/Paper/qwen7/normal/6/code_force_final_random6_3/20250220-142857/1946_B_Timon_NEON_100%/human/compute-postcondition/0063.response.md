Output State: `segments_variants` is a list of all valid segments found during the loop's execution, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found throughout the loop, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered valid during the loop's execution. The `new_segment` will be an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new potential `max_segment` is found. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum among all the segments considered during the loop. Since no new elements are added to `max_sum` within the loop, it remains `-1`.
