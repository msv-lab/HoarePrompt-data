Output State: **`segments_variants` now includes `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_segment` is updated accordingly if `new_segment` is non-empty, and `i` is set to `i_end + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `new_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. This means that if `new_segment` was non-empty, it is now included in `segments_variants` with the additional element `[i - 1]`.
- If `new_segment` is non-empty, `max_segment` is updated based on the new segment.
- The value of `i` is set to `i_end + 1`.
- All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`) retain their previous values unless they are explicitly updated by the code, which is not the case here.
