You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as potential candidates for the maximum sum segment. The `new_segment` will be an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new segment is finalized and added to `segments_variants`. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum encountered during the entire process. Since the loop does not modify `max_sum` unless a new maximum is found, and no new maximum was found in the given conditions, `max_sum` remains -1.

    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `segments_variants` will include every segment variant generated during the process. The variable `new_segment` remains empty as it is only initialized and used within the loop but never assigned outside of it. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum encountered across all iterations. Since `max_sum` is initialized to -1 and only updated when a segment's sum exceeds the current `max_sum` and the segment has more than one element, `max_sum` will either remain -1 or be the sum of the `max_segment`. `total_max_segment` will be the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element, reflecting the best possible segment found according to the given condition.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the subarray with the highest sum among those containing more than one element. It identifies all possible segments in the array, evaluates their sums, and selects the segment with the maximum sum that includes at least two elements. If no such segment exists, it returns a segment containing only the first element of the array.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer, and quantity is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer, and `quantity`, a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 200,000. If `quantity` is within the valid range, it returns the value of `number`. Otherwise, it returns an error message indicating that the quantity is out of the allowed range.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that we can achieve the maximum sum by repeatedly adding the largest positive subarray sums. This is because adding larger positive sums will contribute more to the overall sum than smaller ones.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the result fits within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it has some issues:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` incorrectly. `new_segment` should start as an empty list, and `max_segment` should be initialized as `[0, -1]` to handle edge cases.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` is flawed. It does not correctly track the maximum sum subarray.
     - The final return statement only returns the last segment, which may not be the maximum sum segment.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the solution. It is likely a placeholder or intended for a different part of the solution.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the maximum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose.
   - After finding the maximum sum subarray, we can add this sum `k` times to the original array sum, ensuring we do not exceed `k` operations.

Given the issues with `func_2`, the provided code is not correct for solving the problem as stated.
