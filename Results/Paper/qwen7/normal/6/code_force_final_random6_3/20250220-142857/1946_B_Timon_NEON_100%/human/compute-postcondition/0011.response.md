Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment', 'i - 1']; `new_segment` remains unchanged; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `max_sum` is -1; `len(arr)` is at least 1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and `[i - 1]`, to the list `segments_variants`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
