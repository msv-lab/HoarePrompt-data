Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `segment`, which is iterated over `segments_variants`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**: 
   - `segments_variants` contains `max_segment` plus the element `len(arr) - 1` and a new list containing `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` remains the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop will iterate over each `segment` in `segments_variants`. Therefore, the initial value of `segment` should be one of the elements in `segments_variants`.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to worry about the state changes inside the loop, but we need to ensure that the loop can start.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `segments_variants` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `segment` will take the value of one of the elements in `segments_variants` during each iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `segments_variants` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one element**
