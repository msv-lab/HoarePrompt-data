Output State: **`segments_variants` is now a list containing the new_segment plus the element `i - 1`; `new_segment` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index; `max_segment` remains either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison; `max_sum` remains `-1`.**

This means that the `segments_variants` list has been updated by appending a new segment which includes the `new_segment` and the value of `i - 1`. All other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
