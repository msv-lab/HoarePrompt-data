Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1**

Explanation: The code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`. The values of `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged from their initial states. The current value of `arr[i]` is assumed to be greater than or equal to 0, which is part of the initial condition and remains valid.
