### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

#### Provided Functions:
1. **func_1**: This function seems to traverse the tree and calculate the number of "good" components (components with a size at least \( x \)) and the remaining size of the tree.
2. **func_2**: This function recursively calculates the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex \( v \).
3. **func_3**: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that the number of "good" components is greater than \( k \) and the remaining size of the tree is at least \( x \).
4. **func_4**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions.
5. **func_5**: This function handles the input and calls `func_4` to compute the result.

#### Function Summaries:
- **func_5**: Reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4`.

#### Analysis:
1. **func_1 and func_2**: These functions seem to be trying to calculate the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the tree. However, they do not correctly simulate the process of removing edges and checking the resulting components' sizes.
2. **func_3**: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that the number of "good" components is greater than \( k \) and the remaining size of the tree is at least \( x \). The logic here is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the removal of edges.
3. **func_4**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \). The issue is that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly simulate the removal of edges and check the resulting components' sizes.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not accurately calculate the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

#### Specific Case:
Consider the input:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```

The tree looks like this:
```
   1
  / \
 2   3
```

The correct answer should be 2 because after removing the edge between 1 and either 2 or 3, we get two connected components of sizes 1 and 2. However, the program incorrectly returns 3, which is not possible since removing one edge cannot result in a component of size 3.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, as evidenced by the specific case and the overall structure of the functions.
