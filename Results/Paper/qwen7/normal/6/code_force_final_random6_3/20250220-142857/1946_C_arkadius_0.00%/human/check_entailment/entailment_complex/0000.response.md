Reasoning:
1. **Tree Construction**: The `func_5` function correctly constructs the tree by reading the number of vertices and edges, adding edges using the `add_edge` method, and rooting the tree using `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**: The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. This is done by calling `func_3` to check if the current midpoint value satisfies the condition.

3. **Checking Good Components and Remaining Size**: The `func_3` function checks if the number of good components (subtrees with size at least `x` after removing `k` edges) is sufficient to satisfy the condition. It uses `func_1` to gather information about the good components and remaining sizes of subtrees.

4. **Recursive Traversal and Updating Components**: The `func_1` and `func_2` functions correctly traverse the tree and update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each node. They ensure that the conditions for good components are met and calculate the necessary values for the binary search in `func_4`.

Given that all functions work together to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
