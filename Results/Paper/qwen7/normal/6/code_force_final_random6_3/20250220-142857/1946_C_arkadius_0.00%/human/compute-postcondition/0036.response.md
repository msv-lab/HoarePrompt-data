Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by 1 if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, otherwise it is increased by 1 plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. `tree.vertices[u].good_components'` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is only increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. After executing the if-else block, `u` is set to the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`.**
