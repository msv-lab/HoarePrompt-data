You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a tree structure to determine the number of "good components" and their sizes. A "good component" is defined as a subtree where the remaining size (number of vertices) is greater than or equal to a given minimum size `x` after removing exactly `k` edges.

It calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of good components and their remaining size. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

    #State: Output State: `beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `beg` will be equal to `end`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `beg` and `end` until they converge, with `beg` being incremented and `end` being decremented based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The final value of `mid` will be the same as `beg` and `end`, calculated as (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1 when `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, or `beg` will be set to `mid` and `end` will be adjusted accordingly until they meet.
    return beg
    #The program returns the integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` after they converge.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree structure), an integer n representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer k representing the number of edges to be removed (with 1 ≤ k < n). It uses a binary search approach to find an integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` once they converge. The function returns this integer value, which represents a specific condition related to the tree and the number of edges to be removed.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an object representing the tree structure where methods like add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive are available.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `k` to remove from the tree, constructs the tree structure, adds `k` edges to the tree based on user input, roots the tree, and then calls another function `func_4` to compute and return a value related to the modified tree.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k`.
   - It constructs a tree using the given edges.

2. **Tree Class and Methods:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree structure.
   - The methods `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and others are used to build and manipulate the tree.

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - **`func_1`:** This function seems to be trying to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing some edges. However, the logic inside this function does not seem to correctly implement the problem requirements.
     - The function uses a post-order traversal but does not correctly handle the removal of edges.
   - **`func_2`:** This function recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree.
     - It should be used to check if a subtree can be a good component.
   - **`func_3`:** This function checks if the current value of `x` allows for the removal of `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
     - The logic here is flawed because it uses `func_1` which is incorrectly implemented.
   - **`func_4`:** This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - **`func_5`:** This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges, but it does not correctly simulate the removal of edges.
   - It uses a post-order traversal but does not update the tree structure to reflect the removal of edges.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` in `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` uses `func_1` to check if a given `x` is feasible, but since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_3` will also produce incorrect results.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct in principle but relies on the incorrect implementation of `func_3`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the overall program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
