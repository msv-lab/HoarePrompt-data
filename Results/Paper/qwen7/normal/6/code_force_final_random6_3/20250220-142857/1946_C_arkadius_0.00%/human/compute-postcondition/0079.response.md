Output State: **stack contains (next_u, False), (u, False)**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((u, False))` appends a tuple `(u, False)` to the existing stack. Initially, the stack contains `(next_u, False)`. After executing the code, the stack will contain both `(next_u, False)` and `(u, False)`.
