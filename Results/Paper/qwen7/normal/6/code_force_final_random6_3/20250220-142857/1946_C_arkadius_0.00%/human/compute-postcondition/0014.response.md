Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop continues until all `k` edges have been added to the tree.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- The tree will have `k` edges added between pairs of nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input.
- The function `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` has been called.

The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is being called and its result is being printed. Since the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we can infer that it likely returns a value related to the tree structure or some property derived from the tree with `n` nodes and `k` edges.

Given that `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` has been called, it suggests that the root of the tree is being set up or initialized. However, without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we cannot determine the precise value it returns. 

Thus, the output will be the return value of `func_4(tree, n, k)`, which is a value related to the tree structure but cannot be determined more specifically from the given information.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where func_4 returns a value related to the tree with n nodes and k edges)**
