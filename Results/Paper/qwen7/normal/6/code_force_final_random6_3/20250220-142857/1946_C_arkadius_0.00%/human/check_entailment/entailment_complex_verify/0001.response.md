### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It constructs the tree using the given edges.

2. **Tree Class and Methods:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree structure.
   - The methods `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and others are used to build and manipulate the tree.

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - **`func_1`:** This function is intended to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing some edges. However, the logic inside this function does not correctly implement the problem requirements.
     - The function uses a post-order traversal but does not correctly handle the removal of edges.
   - **`func_2`:** This function recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree.
     - It should be used to check if a subtree can be a good component.
   - **`func_3`:** This function checks if the current value of `x` allows for the removal of `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
     - The logic here is flawed because it uses `func_1` which is incorrectly implemented.
   - **`func_4`:** This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - **`func_5`:** This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **`func_1` Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing some edges.
   - However, it does not correctly simulate the removal of edges. Instead, it just updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes without actually removing edges from the tree.
   - This means that `func_1` is not correctly implementing the problem requirements.

2. **`func_3` Function:**
   - The function `func_3` uses the results from `func_1` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_3` will also produce incorrect results.

3. **`func_4` Function:**
   - The function `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.
   - Given that `func_3` is using incorrect results from `func_1`, `func_4` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program constructs the tree correctly.
   - However, the core logic for determining the maximum `x` is flawed due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1` and `func_3`.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. The core functions `func_1` and `func_3` are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
