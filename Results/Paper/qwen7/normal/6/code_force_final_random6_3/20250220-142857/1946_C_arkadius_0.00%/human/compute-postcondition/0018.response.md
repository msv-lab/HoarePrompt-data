Output State: **`beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is ((`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1)**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint between `beg` and `end` (inclusive) and assigns it to `mid`. Since `beg` is less than `end`, the expression `(beg + end + 1) // 2` computes the ceiling of the average of `beg` and `end`. The values of `beg` and `end` remain unchanged, but `mid` is now set to the calculated value.
