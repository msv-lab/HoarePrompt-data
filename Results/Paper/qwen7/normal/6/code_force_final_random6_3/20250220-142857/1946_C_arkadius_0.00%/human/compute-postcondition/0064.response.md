Postcondition: **`stack` contains tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, `(postorder)` is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding 1 to its current value if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x` for any `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, otherwise `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The state of `tree.vertices[u]` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged.**
