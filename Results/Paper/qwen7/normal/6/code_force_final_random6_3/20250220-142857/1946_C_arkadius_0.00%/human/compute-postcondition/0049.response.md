Output State: The stack will contain a series of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(u, False)`, with `u` being each child vertex of `tree.vertices[v]` in sequence, repeated as many times as necessary to cover all children. Specifically, the stack will contain every child vertex of `tree.vertices[v]` exactly once, each marked as `False`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `stack` will contain every child vertex of `tree.vertices[v]` exactly once, each represented as a tuple `(u, False)`, where `u` is the child vertex.
