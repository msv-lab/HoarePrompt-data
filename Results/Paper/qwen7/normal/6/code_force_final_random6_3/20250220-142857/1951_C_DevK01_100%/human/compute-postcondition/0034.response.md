Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is an integer representing the length of `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `w` now holds the value of the last element in `N`.
