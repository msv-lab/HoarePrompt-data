State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer and having been reduced by 1 because one test case is consumed does not guarantee that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
