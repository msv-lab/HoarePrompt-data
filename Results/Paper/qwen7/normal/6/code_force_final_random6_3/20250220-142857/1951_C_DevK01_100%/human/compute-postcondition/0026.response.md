Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `M` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `M`. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, except that `M` is now updated to the new list of integers.
