Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

This output state describes that the variables `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `N` retain their previous values and relationships as described in the initial state. Additionally, a new variable `cost` is introduced and assigned the value of `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
