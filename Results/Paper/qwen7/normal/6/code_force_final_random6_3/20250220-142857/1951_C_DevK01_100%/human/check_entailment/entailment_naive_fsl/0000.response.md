Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) exceeds the product of the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) and the number of days (`n`). Specifically, the program does not account for the case where `k` is greater than `m * n`, which is possible according to the problem constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 10 20
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```
Here, `n = 20`, `m = 10`, and `k = 20`. According to the problem description, the program should be able to buy 20 tickets under these conditions. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly because it assumes that `k` can always be divided into segments of up to `m` tickets per day, which is not true if `k > m * n`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it can handle cases where `k` is larger than `m * n` by buying tickets in segments that respect the constraints of the problem.
