Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers t, n, m, k, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving n, m, and k, and prints the calculated cost. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total cost for all cases.**
