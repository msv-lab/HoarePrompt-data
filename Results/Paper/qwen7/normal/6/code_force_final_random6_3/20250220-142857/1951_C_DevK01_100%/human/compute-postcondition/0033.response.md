Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

This means that the variable `cost` has been calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
