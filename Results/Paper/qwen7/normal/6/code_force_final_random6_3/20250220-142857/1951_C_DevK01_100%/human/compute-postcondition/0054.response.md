Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`**.

This means that the variable `mu` is now assigned the value of `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
