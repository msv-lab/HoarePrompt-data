Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the following inputs: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases; for each test case, integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)); and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function does not return any value explicitly but processes each test case according to the given inputs.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value.
