Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mu * w` to the variable `cost`. Since `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the last element of the list `N`, the variable `cost` now holds the product of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
