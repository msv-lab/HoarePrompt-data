Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before it was popped.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N`. Since `N` originally contained the first `q` elements of `M`, after popping the last element, `N` now contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`. The variable `w` is assigned the value of the element that was just popped from `N`. All other variables remain unchanged.
