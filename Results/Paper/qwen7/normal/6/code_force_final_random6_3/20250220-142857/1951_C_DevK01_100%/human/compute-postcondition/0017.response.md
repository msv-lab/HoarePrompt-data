Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before it was popped, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` as `mu * w`. Here, `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is the last element of the list `N` before it was popped. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
