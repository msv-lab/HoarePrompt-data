Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `L`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
