Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and now `t` is reduced by 1 because one test case is consumed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before it was popped, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, and `n` is the current length of `N` + 1. The loop continues to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `cost` is calculated based on the conditions given, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. The loop continues to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
