Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string without its first character, and `a` is a set containing the characters `i` and `i`, where `i` is the first character of the original string `s`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still contain at least one character.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `s` will lose its first character in the next iteration since the loop iterates over each character in `s`.
   - The variable `a` will remain unchanged as it does not depend on the loop iteration directly.

5. **Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string without its first character, after the next iteration, `s` will be a non-empty string without its first two characters.
   - The set `a` will still contain the characters `i` and `i`, as no new characters are added or removed from `a` in the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first two characters), `a` is a set containing the characters `i` and `i`**.
