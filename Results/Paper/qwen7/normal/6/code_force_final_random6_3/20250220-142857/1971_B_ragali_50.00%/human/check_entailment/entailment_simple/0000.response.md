### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the string `s`.

2. **Character Set Check**: The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters in `s`. If the size of this set is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string `s`.

3. **Rearrangement Logic**:
   - If the set size is greater than 1, the program attempts to create a new string `newstr` by splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order. This is intended to ensure that `newstr` is not equal to `s`.
   - It also checks if reversing the entire string `s` results in a different string.
   - If neither of these methods produces a different string, it tries to split `s` into two halves and concatenate them differently to ensure a different string is formed.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If a different string can be formed, it prints "YES" followed by the new string.
   - If no different string can be formed, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles strings with more than one unique character by attempting to rearrange them.
   - For strings with only one unique character, the program correctly identifies that no rearrangement is possible and prints "NO".

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" in the required format, and if "YES" is printed, it follows with the new string.

### Conclusion:
The provided program logic and handling of edge cases are correct according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
