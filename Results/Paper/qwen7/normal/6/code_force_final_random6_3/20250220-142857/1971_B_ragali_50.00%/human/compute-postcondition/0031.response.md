Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` is the third element of the set `s`.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `a` is a set containing the elements 0, the first element of the set `s`, and the second element of the set `s`.
- The length of `a` is 1.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the set `a`:

- Since `a` contains three elements but its length is specified as 1, this implies that there must be a duplicate element among the three elements added to `a`.

The only way for `a` to have a length of 1 is if the first element of `s` is the same as the second element of `s`. Therefore, the set `a` would look like this: `{0, first_element_of_s, first_element_of_s}`. This means the set `a` effectively contains only one unique element, which is `0`.

Now, the print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
