Output State: **`cur_arr` is empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains all the elements that satisfied the condition (i.e., their `bit`-th bit is 1) in the order they were encountered, `thing1` is the maximum element in `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit.**

Explanation: The code `thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` assigns the maximum element in `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit to `thing1`. The values of `cur_arr`, `xor`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
