Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the maximum element found in `new_arr` when considering the `(bit - 1)`-th bit and the length of `new_arr`.**

Explanation:
- `cur_arr` is initially empty, so `xor` (which is the result of XORing all elements in `cur_arr`) is 0.
- Since `xor` is 0, its `bit`-th bit is 0, but the problem states that the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, which implies there was a misunderstanding or a different context not aligned with the initial state provided. However, based on the given code and the logical flow, we consider the `bit`-th bit of `xor` as 1.
- `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 1.
- `thing1` is the maximum element in `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit.
- The function `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` would return `None` since `cur_arr` is empty, so the maximum value from this part is considered as `None`.
- Therefore, the function returns the maximum value between `None` (or considered as 0) and the length of `new_arr`.

Since `new_arr` is not empty (as its description implies it contains elements), the length of `new_arr` is a positive integer. Thus, the program returns the length of `new_arr`.
