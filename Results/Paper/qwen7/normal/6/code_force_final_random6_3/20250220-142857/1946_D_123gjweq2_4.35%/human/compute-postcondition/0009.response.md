Output State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element; xor is the result of XORing each element in `cur_arr` with the current value of `xor`; `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. The value of `xor` remains unchanged, and `new_arr` now includes the new value of `xor`. The conditions and properties of `cur_arr` and the calculation of `xor` remain the same as before the code execution.
