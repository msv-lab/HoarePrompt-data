Functionality: **The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It processes the list `cur_arr` by iterating through its elements and performing bitwise operations to determine subsets of elements based on the `bit`-th bit. Depending on the conditions checked during the process, the function either returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the maximum element found in a derived list `new_arr` and the length of `new_arr`, or the maximum element in `new_arr` if certain bit conditions are met, otherwise it returns -1.**
