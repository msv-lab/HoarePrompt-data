Output State: **Postcondition: `cur_arr` must be empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` contains all the elements that satisfied the condition (i.e., their `bit`-th bit is 0) in the order they were encountered.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cur_arr` will be empty because every element has been processed. The variable `xor` will hold the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`. The list `new_arr` will contain all the values of `xor` that were appended to it during the iterations, which means it will include all the values where the `bit`-th bit of `xor` was 0 during those iterations.
