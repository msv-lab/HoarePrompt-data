Output State: **`xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.**

Explanation: Initially, `xor` is the result of XORing each element in `cur_arr` with the current value of `xor`. Since `xor` is set to 0, the first element of `cur_arr` will be XORed with 0, which means `xor` will become that element. However, since `xor` is set to 0 before any elements of `cur_arr` are processed, the value of `xor` remains 0. After setting `xor` to 0, `new_arr` is updated by appending the value of `xor` (which is 0) to it.
