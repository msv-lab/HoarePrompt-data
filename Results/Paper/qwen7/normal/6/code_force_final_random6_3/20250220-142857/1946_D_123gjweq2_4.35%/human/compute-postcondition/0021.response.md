Output State: **`xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus the value of `xor`, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xor` (which is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`) to `new_arr`. Since `new_arr` previously contained the previous elements plus 0, after appending `xor`, it now contains those previous elements plus `xor`. The precondition that `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements remains unchanged.
