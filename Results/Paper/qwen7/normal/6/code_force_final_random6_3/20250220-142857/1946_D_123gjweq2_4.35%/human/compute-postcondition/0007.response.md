Output State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element; xor is the result of XORing each element in `cur_arr` with the current value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The line `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the current value of `i` (which is an element from `cur_arr`). Since `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `i` represents one of those elements. The output state reflects that `xor` has been updated according to this operation, and `cur_arr` remains unchanged except for its implicit use in the operation.
