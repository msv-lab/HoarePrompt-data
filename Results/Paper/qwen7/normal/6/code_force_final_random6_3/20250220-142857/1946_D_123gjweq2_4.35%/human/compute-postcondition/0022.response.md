Output State: **`xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus the value of 0, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code initializes `xor` to 0. Since `xor` was previously the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, setting `xor` to 0 means that the cumulative XOR operation has been reset. The value of `new_arr` is updated to include the previous elements plus the value of `xor`, which is 0. The condition that `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements remains unchanged.
