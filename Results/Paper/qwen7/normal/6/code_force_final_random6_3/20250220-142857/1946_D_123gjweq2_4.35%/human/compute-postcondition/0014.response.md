Output State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element; `xor` is now `xor ^ i`; `new_arr` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. Since `i` is an element of `cur_arr`, the new value of `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `xor` and `i`. The states of `cur_arr` and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
