Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the value entered by the user as a string, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of '1's in the string `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1's in the string `s2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, and `hd` is now greater than 0 by -1. At the current index `i`, if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `hd`, and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `hd` is set to -1, and `res` is set to 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `hd`, and `res` remain as they were before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `hd` is -2, and if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is 1 more than its previous value. If the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is not met, the values of `res`, `i`, `hd`, and `n` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
