Output State: **`i` is `n`, `hd` is `-n`, `res` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' from the start up to the last iteration, `s1` and `s2` are the same strings, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the values of `i`, `hd`, `res`, `s1`, `s2`, or `t`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than its current value means that `t` is incremented by 1.
