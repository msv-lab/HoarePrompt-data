Output State: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` with each iteration until it reaches `n`. The value of `hd` decreases by 1 for each iteration where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', but since the loop continues when `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` will eventually reach `a1 - a2 - n` once `hd` can no longer be decremented. The variable `res` is incremented by 1 for each such iteration, resulting in `res` being equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + n`. The counts of '1's in `s1` (`a1`) and `s2` (`a2`) do not change within the loop.
