Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `hd` is decreased by 1; `res` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `hd`, `s1`, and `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
