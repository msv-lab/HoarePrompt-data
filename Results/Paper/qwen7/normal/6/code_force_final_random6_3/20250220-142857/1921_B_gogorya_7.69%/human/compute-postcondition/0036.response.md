Output State: **All iterations of the loop have executed, meaning `i` equals `n`, `hd` is `-n`, and `res` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' from the start up to the last iteration.**

In this final state, the variable `n` will no longer be used as `i` has reached its limit and exceeded `n`. The variable `hd` will be `-n` because it decreases by 1 each time the condition `hd > 0` is met, which happens until `hd` becomes less than or equal to 0. The variable `res` will hold the cumulative count of instances where a '1' in `s1` corresponds to a '0' in `s2` across all iterations of the loop.
