Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is -2, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to the variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of `n`, `i`, and `hd` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement only affects the flow of the loop, causing it to proceed to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the current iteration.
