Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to `n`.
   - `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, the loop will not execute at the start because `i` is not less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the loop. Therefore, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

Here is the final state:

**State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a variable, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`**
