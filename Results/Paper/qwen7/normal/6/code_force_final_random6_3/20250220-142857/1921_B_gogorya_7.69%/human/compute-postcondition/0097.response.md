Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`, we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no specific changes are made to the variables within the loop (other than incrementing `i`), the values of `hd`, `res`, `a1`, `a2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `i` is less than `n` and `i` becomes `i + 1` indicates that the loop continues with the updated value of `i`.
