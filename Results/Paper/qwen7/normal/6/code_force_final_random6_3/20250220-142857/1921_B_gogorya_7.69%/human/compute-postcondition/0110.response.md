Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` equals '1' and `s2[i]` equals '0', then `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, and `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 3` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. If `s1[i]` does not equal '1' or `s2[i]` does not equal '0', the conditions for `hd` and `res` remain unchanged.
