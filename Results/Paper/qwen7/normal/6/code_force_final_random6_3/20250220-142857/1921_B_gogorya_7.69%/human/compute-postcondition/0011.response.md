Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `hd` is now greater than 0 by -1, meaning `hd` is greater than -1**.

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value while still remaining greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 0). Therefore, `hd` is now greater than -1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
