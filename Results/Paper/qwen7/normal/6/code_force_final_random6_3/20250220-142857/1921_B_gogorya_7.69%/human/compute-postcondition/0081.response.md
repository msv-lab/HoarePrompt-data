Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is incremented by the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i] is '0', `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hd` to be equal to `a1 - a2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`, `hd` is now `a1 - a2`, `res` is incremented by the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `a1` is still the count of '1's in `s1`, and `a2` is still the count of '1's in `s2`.
