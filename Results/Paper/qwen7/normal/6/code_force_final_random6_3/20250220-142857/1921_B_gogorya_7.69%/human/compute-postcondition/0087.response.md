The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `hd`, `res`, `a1`, `a2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `i < n` remains valid.

Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1` and is currently greater than -1, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n`.**
