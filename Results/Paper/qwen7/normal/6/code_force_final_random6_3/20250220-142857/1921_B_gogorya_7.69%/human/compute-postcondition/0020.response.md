Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `hd` is now greater than 0 by -1 (which means `hd` is 0).
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' at the current index `i`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain the same.
   - `hd` and `res` do not change unless the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is met, but since we are only concerned with the loop head variables, these values do not need to be adjusted here.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged**. 

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_new`, `hd` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged**.

Since `i` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged**.
