Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, but its specific value is not provided and does not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is a list, and `i` is used as an index to access the element at position 1 in the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, the code will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

However, the value of `a[1]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it as the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1]**
