Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` equals 2

The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[0] a[0] **
