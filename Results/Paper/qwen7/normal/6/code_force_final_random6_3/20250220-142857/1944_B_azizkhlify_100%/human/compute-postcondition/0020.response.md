Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000
   - `r[a[i-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (Note: This is based on the value of `a[i-1]` from the previous iteration)

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being `n + 1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < 2 * n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will execute as long as `n + 1 < 2 * n`.
   - Simplifying the inequality: `n + 1 < 2 * n` simplifies to `1 < n`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n + 2`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` will be `n + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r[a[i-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is now `n + 2`, the relevant index in `r` will be `a[n+1] - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `r[a[n+1] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
