Output State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, `ur` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the condition for setting `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0 and increasing `ur` by 2 does not apply (as per the postcondition), the only effect of the `break` statement is to exit the loop or conditional block. The values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
