Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. This means the loop variable `i` starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`.
   - The other variables mentioned in the postcondition are `n` and the condition related to `ul` and `ur`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition states that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be at least 3, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop or if statement we were inside is broken out.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless the loop or if statement is broken out due to `ul == ur`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be `n + 1`.
- `n` remains at least 3.
- The condition `ul == ur` still needs to be considered, but since no information suggests it has changed, we assume it hasn't.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop or if statement we were inside is broken out.**
