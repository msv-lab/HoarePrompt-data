Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in res:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` still contains at least one element, and `i` will be set to the first element of `res`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `res`**
