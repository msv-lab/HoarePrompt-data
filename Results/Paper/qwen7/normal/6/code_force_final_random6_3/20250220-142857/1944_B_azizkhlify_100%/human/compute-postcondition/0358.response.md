Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in res`. The variables involved here are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable is being iterated over the elements of `res`.
   - `res`: This is a list containing values of `a[i]` that met the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the third occurrence.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `res` must contain at least one element. If `res` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is being iterated over `res`, the only state that needs adjustment is `res`. We need to ensure that `res` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `res` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` must contain at least one element**
