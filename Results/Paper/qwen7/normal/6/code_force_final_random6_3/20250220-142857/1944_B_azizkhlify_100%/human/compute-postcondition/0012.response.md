Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `a[4] - 1` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of n zeros, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 5**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` by 1. Given that `i` is 4, the code effectively increments the element at index `a[4] - 1` in list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
