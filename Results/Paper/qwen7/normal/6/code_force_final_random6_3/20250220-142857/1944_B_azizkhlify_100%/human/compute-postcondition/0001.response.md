Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `k` using `input().split()`, which takes the input as a string and splits it into two parts based on whitespace. Then, it converts these parts into integers using `int()`. Since the initial state specifies that the input must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ input ≤ 5000, both `n` and `k` will also be within this range.
