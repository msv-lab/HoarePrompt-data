Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to zero.
   - An empty list `res` is created to store elements for the second part of the solution.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program counts how many times each element appears in the first half of the array (`l`).
   - It counts how many times each element appears in the second half of the array (`r`).

4. **Constructing `l`:**
   - The program tries to fill `l` with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the first half.
   - If it finds `k` pairs, it breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are remaining elements needed to complete `l`, it takes single occurrences from the first half and adds them to `res`.

6. **Printing `l`:**
   - It prints the elements of `l`.

7. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The program fills `r` with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the second half.
   - If `l` and `r` have different numbers of elements, it adjusts `r` to match the number of elements in `l`.

8. **Printing `r`:**
   - It prints the elements of `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Construction of `l`:**
   - The program attempts to fill `l` with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the first half. However, this approach might not always work because it only considers exact pairs and ignores the possibility of using single occurrences to balance the XOR values.

2. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The logic for handling remaining elements in `l` is flawed. It only considers single occurrences from the first half, which might not be sufficient to balance the XOR values.

3. **Construction of `r`:**
   - The program constructs `r` by filling it with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the second half. This might not always result in a valid solution because it doesn't consider the XOR values of `l` and `r`.

4. **Balancing XOR Values:**
   - The program does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. It only tries to construct `l` and `r` without considering the XOR constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
