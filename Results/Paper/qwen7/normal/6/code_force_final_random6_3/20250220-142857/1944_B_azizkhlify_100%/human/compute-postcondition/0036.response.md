Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `current_i + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `ul` is `current_ul + 2`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

From the initial state, we know that `a[i]` is an element of the list `a` at index `i`. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, it means that `a[i] - 1` is an index in the list `l` where the value is 0.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of its relationship with the list `a`.

Given this information, the output will be:

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
