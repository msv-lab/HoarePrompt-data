Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `2 * n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.
   - `ul` is increased by 4.
   - If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2 * n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Check the postconditions**:
   - `a` remains a list of integers.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` will be checked again with the new value of `i`.
   - `ul` is increased by 4 again.
   - The break condition `ul == k * 2` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, and `ul` is increased by 4. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
