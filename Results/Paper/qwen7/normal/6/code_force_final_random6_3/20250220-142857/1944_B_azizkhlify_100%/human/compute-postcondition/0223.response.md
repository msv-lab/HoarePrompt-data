Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the original value of `k`, `res` is the list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, and `re` is 2.**

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to execute as long as `re` (which starts at 0) is less than `k`. After the loop executes 3 times, `i` becomes 3, and since `re` is 2, the loop breaks because `re` is now equal to `k`. At this point, `res` contains the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` because these are the elements that met the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` during the loop iterations. The value of `n` remains the original value of `k`, and `re` is set to 2, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
