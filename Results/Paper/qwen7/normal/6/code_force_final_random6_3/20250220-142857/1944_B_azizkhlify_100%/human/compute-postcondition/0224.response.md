Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is the original value of `k`, `res` is the list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, and `re` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `k` is true, then `i` is set to 3, `n` retains its original value as `k`, `res` contains the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, and `re` is set to 2. Since there is no else part, these conditions apply regardless of the truth value of the if condition.
