Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions**:
   - `i` is `current_i + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `ul` is `current_ul + 4`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.
   - `ul == k * 2` holds true.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - `i` increases by 1 from the previous value (`current_i`).
   - `ul` increases by 4 from the previous value (`current_ul`).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - `ul` must still satisfy `ul == k * 2`.

Given these conditions, let's update the states:

- `i` becomes `current_i + 1`.
- `ul` becomes `current_ul + 4`.
- `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started (since it is not modified within the loop).
- `l[a[i] - 1]` must still be 0 for the loop to continue.

Since the loop condition depends on `i < n` and `ul == k * 2` must hold, we need to ensure these conditions are met for the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `current_i + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `current_ul + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, assuming that `ul == k * 2` holds true.**
