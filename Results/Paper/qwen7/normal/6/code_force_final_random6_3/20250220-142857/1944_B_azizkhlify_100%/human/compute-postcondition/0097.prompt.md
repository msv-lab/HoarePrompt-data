Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is now `4 * k - ul`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `k * 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range from `n` to `2*n-1`. After the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `re` will be equal to the number of elements added to `res` based on the condition that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `res` will be a list containing those elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` will iterate over elements in `res`, `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, `ul` is `k * 2`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` will iterate over elements in `res`, `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, `ul` is `k * 2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `res`, `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, `ul` is `k * 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
