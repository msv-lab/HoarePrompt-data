Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and for each test case, two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋) and an array a which is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Based on these inputs, the function determines and returns specific outputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it uses the integers `n` and `k`, along with the array `a`, to perform some operation or check certain conditions, and then returns the result accordingly.
