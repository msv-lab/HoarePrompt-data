Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is incremented by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2, then the conditions remain unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `r`, `ur`, but it indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions related to these variables remain the same as before the `break` statement was executed.
