Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 2.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. However, there is no variable named `ur` mentioned in the initial state, and the only variable that could be affected is `r[a[i] - 1]`, which was previously 0. After executing the code, `r[a[i] - 1]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
