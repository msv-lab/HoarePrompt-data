Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is less than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the break statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. The condition regarding `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2 also remains unchanged because the break statement does not affect it. Therefore, the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
