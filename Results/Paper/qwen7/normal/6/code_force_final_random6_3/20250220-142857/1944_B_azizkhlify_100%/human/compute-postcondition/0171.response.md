Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `2 * n`: This means `i` is twice the value of `n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers: No specific values are provided for the list `a`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0: This implies that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 0. However, since `l` is not defined, we only know this relationship but not the actual value of `l`.
   - `ul` is increased by 2, and it equals `k * 2`: This means `ul` is initially `k * 2` and then increased by 2. So, `ul = k * 2 + 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`: This statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice followed by a space.

Given these points, we need to determine the value of `a[i]`:
- Since `i` is `2 * n`, `a[i]` is `a[2 * n]`.
- We do not have any explicit value for `a[2 * n]`, so we cannot provide a specific number. However, we can describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a[2 * n] a[2 * n]**
