Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop head contains the variable `i`.
- The loop head does not contain the variable `n` directly, but it is used in the range function to define the number of iterations.

### Adjusting the State
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming it was less than `n`).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the beginning of the previous iteration, it would be `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2` (if `i` was `k` at the start of the current iteration).

3. **Adjust the state:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - `i` must be set to `k + 2` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the start of the current iteration).

### Final State
- Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
- Therefore, `i` should be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

### Updated State
State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the start of the current iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given the format required, we can write it as:

State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.
