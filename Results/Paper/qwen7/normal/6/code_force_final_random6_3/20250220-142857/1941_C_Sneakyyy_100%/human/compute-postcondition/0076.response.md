To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Current State
- `i` is either 1 or 3.
- `len(a)` is greater than 2.
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant for this loop).
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` of `a` starting from index 0 and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.

### Determining the Next State
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the condition `i < len(a) - 2`.

#### Case 1: `i` is 1
- If `i` is 1, then `i + 1` would be 2.
- For the loop to continue, `2` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.
- This implies `len(a) > 4`.

#### Case 2: `i` is 3
- If `i` is 3, then `i + 1` would be 4.
- For the loop to continue, `4` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.
- This implies `len(a) > 6`.

### Conclusion
Since `len(a)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue when `i` is 1, and greater than 6 when `i` is 3, the most general condition that covers both cases is `len(a) > 6`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is either 1 or 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` of `a` starting from index 0 and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0**.
