Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index `i + 2` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent), and the number of iterations left is the next value of `int(input())`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
