Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`, and based on these inputs, the function performs some operations and returns a result. However, the exact nature of the operations and the result is not specified in the given information.
