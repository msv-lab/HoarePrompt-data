Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 6, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index `i` and having a length of 3, unless the index `i + 2` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent, and the number of iterations left is \(N - k\)**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1 (when `s` is 'map' or 'pie'), it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
