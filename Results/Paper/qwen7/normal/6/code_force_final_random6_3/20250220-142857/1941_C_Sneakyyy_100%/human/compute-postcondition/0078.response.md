Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 6; `len(a)` must be greater than 6; `a` remains unchanged; `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 4, and if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 6. The other variables (`len(a)`, `a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
