Output State: **`i` is either 5, 7, or 9; `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` remains unchanged; `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index `i + 2` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent); `len(a)` must be greater than 8; `s` is updated to the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given the initial state where `i` is either 2, 4, or 6, adding 3 to each of these values results in `i` being either 5, 7, or 9. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided conditions.
