Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 4; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with its length greater than 5; `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 3, it becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `s` remain unchanged.
