The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is either 1 or 3. After incrementing, `i` will be either 2 or 4. The states of the other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 4; `len(a)` must be greater than 6; `a` remains unchanged; `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.**
