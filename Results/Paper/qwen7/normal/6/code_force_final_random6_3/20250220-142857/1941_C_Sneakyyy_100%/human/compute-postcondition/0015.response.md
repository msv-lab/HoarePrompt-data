Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 3; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with its length greater than 5; `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3; `s` is assigned the value of the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

In more detail:
- The value of `i` remains either 1 or 3.
- The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `a` remains a string with a length greater than 5.
- The value of `ans` remains 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise it remains 0.
- The value of `s` is now the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.
