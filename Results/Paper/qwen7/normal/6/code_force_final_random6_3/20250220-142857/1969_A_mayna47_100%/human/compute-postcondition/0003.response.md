Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the range of `i`**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute properly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` takes on values within the specified range.

3. **Initial state of `i`**: The problem does not specify an initial value for `i`, but it should be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
4. **Range of `n`**: The variable `n` is given as an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to `1` and ensure that `n` is within the valid range.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be `1`.
- `n` should be within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
