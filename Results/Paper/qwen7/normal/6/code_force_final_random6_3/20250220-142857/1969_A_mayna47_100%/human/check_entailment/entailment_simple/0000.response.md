Reasoning:
1. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the cases where no pair of friends can be found such that both friends in the pair receive invitations.
2. The variable `v` is initialized with a size of `n + 1`, but it should only be of size `n` since indices from 1 to n are used.
3. The logic inside `func_1()` is flawed. It assumes that if `v[v[i]] == i`, then exactly two friends will attend the party. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the input `p = [2, 1]`. Here, `v = [0, 2, 1]` and `v[v[1]] == 1`, but only one friend would attend the party if invited.
4. The program prints `2` if such a pair is found, which is incorrect because it might not be the minimum number of invitations needed. It should instead check for cycles and ensure that at least two friends are invited.
5. The program prints `3` in all other cases, which is also incorrect. The actual solution requires checking for cycles and ensuring that at least two friends are invited, which may require more or fewer than three invitations depending on the input.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
