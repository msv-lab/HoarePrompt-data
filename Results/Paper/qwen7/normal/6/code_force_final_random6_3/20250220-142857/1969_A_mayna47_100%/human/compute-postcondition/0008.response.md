Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`, and `n` is an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`. Additionally, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently `1` and `n` is an integer between `2` and `50`, `i` is indeed less than `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop can execute again, we need to update `i` to its new value, which is `2` (since `i` will increment by `1` in the next iteration). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Final state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`**
