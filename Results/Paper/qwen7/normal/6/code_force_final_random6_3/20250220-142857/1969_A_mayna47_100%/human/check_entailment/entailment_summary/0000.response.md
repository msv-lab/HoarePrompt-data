Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. The provided program defines a single function `func_1()` which is supposed to handle each test case.
3. The program reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
4. It then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it means only 2 invitations are needed, and it prints `2`.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, assuming that inviting three friends will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

However, the logic in `func_1()` is flawed. Specifically:
- The program initializes `v` with an extra `0` at the beginning, which is unnecessary and could cause confusion.
- The check `v[v[i]] == i` alone is insufficient to guarantee that at least 2 friends will come. For instance, consider the input `p = [2, 1]`. Here, no pair of friends are each other's best friends, but inviting just one friend (either 1 or 2) would still result in at least one friend coming to the party.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships and ensure that at least one cycle of length 2 or more is covered.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
