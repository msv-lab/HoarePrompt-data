Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle one test case at a time.
2. The function initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the input values.
3. It then iterates through the indices from 1 to `n` to check if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. This would mean that `i` and `v[i]` form a pair that can both be invited, ensuring both attend the party.
4. If such a pair is found, the function correctly prints `2` and returns, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed.
5. If no such pair is found, the function prints `3`, which is incorrect based on the problem statement. According to the problem, if no such pair is found, the minimum number of invitations needed should be `n` (since each person needs their own best friend to also be invited).

Given these points, the function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations required when no pair is found. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
