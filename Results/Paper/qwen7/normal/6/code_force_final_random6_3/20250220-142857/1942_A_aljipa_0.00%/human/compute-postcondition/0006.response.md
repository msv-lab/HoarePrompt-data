Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is either a list with `n` elements all set to 1, or a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`, or a list with a single element `-1`, `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `k` is assigned the value of the second input integer.**

This means that the values of `t` and `res` remain unchanged, while `n` and `k` are now assigned the values of the integers inputted by the user, one for `n` and another for `k`.
