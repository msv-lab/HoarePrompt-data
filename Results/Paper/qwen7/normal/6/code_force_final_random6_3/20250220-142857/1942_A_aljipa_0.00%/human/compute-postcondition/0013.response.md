Output State: The value of `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the final value of `t` provided by the user. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `res` is either a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list with a single element `-1` if neither condition is met. After all iterations, the output will consist of the result of `print(*res)` for each iteration, repeated `t` times.
