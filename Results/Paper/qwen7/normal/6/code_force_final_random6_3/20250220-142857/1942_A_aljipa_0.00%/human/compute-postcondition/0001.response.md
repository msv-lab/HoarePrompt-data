State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
2. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment; it is used as a counter in the loop.
3. The key variable here is `t`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.
4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
5. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
6. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

Hence, the state to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
