Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is either a list with `n` elements all set to 1, or a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`, or a list with a single element `-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned based on the condition:
- If `k == n`, then `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1.
- If `k == 1`, then `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.

The conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
