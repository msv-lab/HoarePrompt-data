Output State: The value of `t` must be exactly equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, which is greater than 0. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. The variable `res` will be a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list with a single element `-1` otherwise.

This means after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will reflect the total number of iterations, and for each iteration, `res` will be determined based on the conditions provided with the respective `n` and `k` values.
