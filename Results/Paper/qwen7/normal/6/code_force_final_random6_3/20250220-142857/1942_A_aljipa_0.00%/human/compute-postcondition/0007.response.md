Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is an input integer.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged and is an input integer.
- The variable `res` is updated based on the conditions:
  - If `k == n`, then `res` becomes a list with `n` elements all set to 1.
  - If `k == 1`, then `res` becomes a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` becomes a list with a single element `-1`.
