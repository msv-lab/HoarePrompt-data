Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1. This information is not directly relevant to the `print(*res)` statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k` equals `n`, then `res` is a list with `n` elements, all set to 1.
     - If `k` equals 1, then `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*res)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `res`**:
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we need to consider the three possible cases for `res`:
     - Case 1: `k == n` → `res` is a list with `n` elements, all set to 1.
     - Case 2: `k == 1` → `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1` → `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `*` operator in `print(*res)` unpacks the elements of `res` and prints them separated by spaces.

Given the above breakdown, let's consider the three cases:

### Case 1: `k == n`
- `res` is a list with `n` elements, all set to 1.
- The print statement will output: `1 1 ... 1` (with `n` ones).

### Case 2: `k == 1`
- `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- The print statement will output: `0 1 2 ... n-1` (with `n` numbers).

### Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1`
- `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.
- The print statement will output: `-1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we need to provide the general form of the output based on the conditions.

Output: **1 1 ... 1 (if k == n), 0 1 2 ... n-1 (if k == 1), -1 (otherwise)**
