### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted. If no such array exists, we should return `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k == n`, it returns `[1] * n` (an array of `n` ones).
     - If `k == 1`, it returns `range(n)` (an array from `0` to `n-1`).
     - Otherwise, it returns `[-1]`.

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - **Case `k == n`**: An array where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1] * n`) will have all cyclic shifts sorted. This is correct.
   - **Case `k == 1`**: An array with distinct elements (e.g., `range(n)`) will have only one cyclic shift sorted (the original array). This is also correct.
   - **Case `k != n` and `k != 1`**: The program returns `[-1]`, indicating no valid array can be generated. However, this is not always true. For example, consider `n = 3` and `k = 2`. A valid array could be `[1, 2, 3]` because its cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`, with exactly 2 of them being sorted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array when `1 < k < n`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a solution for cases where `1 < k < n`.
