Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing `n` and `k`, and it processes these test cases according to the given constraints, returning a result for each based on the values of `n` and `k`.
