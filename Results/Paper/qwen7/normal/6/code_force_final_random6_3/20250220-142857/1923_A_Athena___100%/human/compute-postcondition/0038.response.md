Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `res` is equal to the total number of zeros in the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The variable `res` is not updated because the code does not modify the count of zeros in the list `a`; it only changes the contents of `a` to a list of integers.
