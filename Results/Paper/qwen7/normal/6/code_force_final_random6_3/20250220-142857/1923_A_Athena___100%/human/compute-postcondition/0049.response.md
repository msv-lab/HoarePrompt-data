Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of `a` is zero (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` contains all elements except the last one.
   - The last element of `a` is no longer zero.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must not be empty (`a`), and the last element of `a` must be zero (`a[-1] == 0`).
   - Since the last element of `a` is no longer zero, we need to adjust this state to make it zero again.
   - Additionally, `a` should not be empty, but since it contains all elements except the last one, it is not empty.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to add the last element back to `a` and set the last element to zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- Add the last element back to `a`.
- Set the last element of `a` to zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` contains all elements including the last one, and the last element of `a` is zero**
