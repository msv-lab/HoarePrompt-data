Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` now contains at least one element which is not 0, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` originally contained at least one element which was 0, after popping, `a` will contain at least one element which is no longer 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
