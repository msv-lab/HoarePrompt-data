Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: Initially, `t` is `t - 1`. After executing `n = int(input())`, the value of `t` is updated to `t - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `t - 2`. The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the input provided by the user. The state of `n` is dependent on the user's input, hence it is described as "an input integer".
