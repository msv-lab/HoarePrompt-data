Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`. This means the loop continues as long as the list `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is `0`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list with its first element removed. This implies that `a` is no longer empty (since its first element has been removed), but we don't know the value of `a[0]` yet.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue if both conditions (`a` is not empty and `a[0] == 0`) are met.
   - Since `a` is no longer empty (its first element was removed), the condition `a` is not empty is already satisfied.
   - For the loop to continue, `a[0]` must still be `0`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `a[0]` is `0` for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `a` is a list with its first element removed, we need to ensure that the new first element of `a` is `0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the first element of `a` is `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list with its first element removed and its new first element must be 0**
