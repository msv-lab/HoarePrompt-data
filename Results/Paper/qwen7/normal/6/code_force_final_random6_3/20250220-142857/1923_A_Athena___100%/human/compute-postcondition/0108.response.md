Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n`, and a list of `n` binary values (0s and 1s). It then removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the remaining zeros. Finally, it prints the total count of zeros across all test cases.**
