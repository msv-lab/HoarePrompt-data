Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the front of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. Since the loop executes up to 3 times and the conditions given indicate that the first element of `a` was 0 each time, `a` will be emptied after these iterations. The variable `t` decreases by 2 for each iteration of the loop, so after `n` iterations, it will decrease by `2 * n`. The variables `res` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
