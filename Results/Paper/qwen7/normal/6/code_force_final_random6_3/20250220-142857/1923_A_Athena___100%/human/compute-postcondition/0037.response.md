Output State: **`a` is empty, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `res` is equal to the total number of zeros in the original list `a`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The initial state of `a` being empty, `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive (decremented by 1), `n` remaining an input integer, and `res` being equal to the total number of zeros in the original list `a` remains unchanged except for `n`, which now holds the value of the user's input.
