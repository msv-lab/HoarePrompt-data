Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed and the first element of `a` was 0, now the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` was 0 (as per the initial state), after executing the code, the first element of `a` is removed, but the value of `res` remains unchanged at 0. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation.
