Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` is empty; `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` remains an input integer; `res` is equal to the total number of zeros in the original list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `a` has been fully iterated through, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If any element `a[i]` was 0 during the iteration, `res` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 0. Otherwise, `res` retains its final value based on the last increment or its initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 6 * n`, `a` is an empty list, and `res` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
