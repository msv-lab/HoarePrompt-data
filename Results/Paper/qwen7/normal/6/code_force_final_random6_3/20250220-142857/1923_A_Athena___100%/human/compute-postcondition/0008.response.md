Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` must be 0, after executing this line, the first element of `a` is no longer there. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
