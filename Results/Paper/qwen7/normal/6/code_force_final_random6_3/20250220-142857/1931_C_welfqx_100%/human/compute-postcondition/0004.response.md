Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. Each string is then converted to an integer using `int(_)`. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `num`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.
