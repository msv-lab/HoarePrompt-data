Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - The condition `num[1] == num[2]` was checked, and based on the postcondition, either `cn` is set to 1 or the loop breaks.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`
   - This means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (if it hasn't already been incremented beyond this point).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i < n - 1`, and `n` is not modified within the loop.

6. **New State:**
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
