Postcondition: **After the if else block executes, `cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an integer, `onum` is a list of integers, and `ck` will be incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`.**
