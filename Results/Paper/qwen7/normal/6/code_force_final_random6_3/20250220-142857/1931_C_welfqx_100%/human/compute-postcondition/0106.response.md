Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed version of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`**.

The code assigns the first character of the reversed version of `num` to `symb2`. Since `onum` is the reversed version of `num`, `onum[0]` is the same as `num[-1]`, which is also the last character of `num`. Therefore, `symb2` is set to the last character of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
