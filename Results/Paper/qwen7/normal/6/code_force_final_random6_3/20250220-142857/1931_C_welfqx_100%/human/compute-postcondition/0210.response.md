Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `ck` was initially either 1 or 2. After executing `ck += 1`, `ck` is incremented by 1. Since `ck` could only be 1 or 2 initially, incrementing it by 1 results in `ck` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
