Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list reversed; `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of the `num` list, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num` list.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the reversed `num` list to `symb2`. Since `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb2` is set to the first element of `onum`, which is the last element of the original `num` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
