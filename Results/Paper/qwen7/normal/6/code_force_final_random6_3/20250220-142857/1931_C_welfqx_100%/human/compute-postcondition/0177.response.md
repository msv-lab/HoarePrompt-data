Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`. However, since `onum` is just a copy of `num`, the original `num` remains unchanged. The values of `j` and `f` remain the same as they were not affected by the operation.
