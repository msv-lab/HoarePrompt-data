Output State: `j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-1`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `ii` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) and increments `ii` with each iteration. The loop checks if consecutive elements in `onum` are equal. If they are, it increments `ck` by 1; otherwise, it breaks out of the loop. Since the loop continues as long as consecutive elements are equal, `ck` will be 1 if the last two elements in `onum` are not equal, or 2 if they are equal. The other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
