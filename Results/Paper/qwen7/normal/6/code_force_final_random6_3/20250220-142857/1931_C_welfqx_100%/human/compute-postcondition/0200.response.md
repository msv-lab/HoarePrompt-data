Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `cn` is incremented by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `num` that are equal until a pair is found where they are not equal, at which point the loop breaks.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will still be `n-2`, `f` remains 1, `onum` remains the reverse of `num`, `ck` remains 1, `symb1` remains `num[0]`, and `symb2` remains `onum[0]`. The variable `cn` will be incremented by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `num` that are equal, continuing until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal, at which point the loop will exit.
