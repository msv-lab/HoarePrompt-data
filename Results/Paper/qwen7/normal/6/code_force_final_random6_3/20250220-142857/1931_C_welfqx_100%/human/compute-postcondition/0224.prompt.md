Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain valid.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` will be `n - 2`, `n` will be a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`), and `num` is a list. `ck` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached. `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if else block executes, `cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an integer, `onum` is a list of integers, and `ck` will be incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-1`, and `cn` is `ck + 1` if `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`; otherwise, the same variables retain their initial or previously determined values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
