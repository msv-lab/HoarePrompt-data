Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ii`, `n`, or `cn`. It only indicates that the loop or conditional block it is inside is exited. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
