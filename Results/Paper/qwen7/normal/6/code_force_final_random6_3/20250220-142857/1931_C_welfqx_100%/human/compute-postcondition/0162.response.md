Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `f` is 0. If the element at index `j` in `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `j` in `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1`, the conditions remain unchanged.
