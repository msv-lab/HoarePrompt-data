Output State: `j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `ii` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `ii` from `0` to `n-2` and stops when it encounters a pair of consecutive elements in `onum` that are not equal. Since the loop does not change the values of `j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2`, these variables retain their initial or previously determined values. The loop terminates when `ii` reaches `n-1`, meaning the condition `onum[ii] != onum[ii + 1]` is met (since `onum[ii + 1]` would be out of bounds if `ii` were `n-1` and the loop did not break earlier).
