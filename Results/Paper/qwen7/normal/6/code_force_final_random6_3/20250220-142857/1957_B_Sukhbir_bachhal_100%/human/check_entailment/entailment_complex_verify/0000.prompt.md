You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `position` is 32, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is now 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. Since each iteration halves the value of `n`, and it takes 32 iterations to reduce any non-zero integer within the given constraints to 0 through right-shifting, `position` will be 32 when the loop terminates. At this point, `n` will be 0 because it has been fully right-shifted. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 31
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it performs a series of right shifts on `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts. The function then returns the count minus one, which will be 31.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence for certain inputs. 

Consider the test case `n=2` and `k=4`. According to the problem description, the optimal solution would be `[4, 0]`, because `4 | 0 = 4` and the binary representation of 4 is `100`, which has only one 1. However, the program generates `[3, 1]` instead, because it sets `counter` to 1 (since `func_1(4)` returns 1), and then appends `2 ** counter - 1` (which is 3) and `k - arr[-1]` (which is 1). This results in a bitwise OR of `3 | 1 = 3`, which has only one 1 in its binary representation.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has as many 1s as possible. One way to do this is to set most elements to 0 and use the remaining value to fill the sum `k`. Here's an alternative approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = [0] * (n - 1) + [k]
    print(*arr)
```

This approach ensures that the sum of the array is `k` and the bitwise OR of the array will have as many 1s as possible, since most elements are 0 and the last element is `k`.
