Output State: **`position` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1 bit, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**

The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Initially, `position` is 0, so after executing the code, `position` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
