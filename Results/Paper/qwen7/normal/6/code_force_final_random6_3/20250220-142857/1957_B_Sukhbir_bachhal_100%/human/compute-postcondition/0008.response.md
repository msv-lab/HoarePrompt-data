Output State: **`position` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is half of its original value (non-zero even number).**

Explanation: The bitwise right shift operator (`>>=`) divides the value of `n` by 2, shifting the bits to the right. Since `n` is a non-zero even number, dividing it by 2 results in another even number. The values of `position` and `t` remain unchanged.
