Output State: `position` is 32, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is now `n` right-shifted by 32 bits, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit per iteration and increment `position` by 1 until `n` becomes 0. Given that the loop executes 3 times initially, we can deduce that it will continue to execute until `n` has been right-shifted 32 times (since each shift halves the value, and \(2^{32}\) is the largest power of 2 within the constraint of `n` being at most \(2 \times 10^5\)). After 32 shifts, `n` will effectively become 0, as it cannot be further halved without becoming zero or negative. Thus, `position` will be 32, and `n` will be 0.
