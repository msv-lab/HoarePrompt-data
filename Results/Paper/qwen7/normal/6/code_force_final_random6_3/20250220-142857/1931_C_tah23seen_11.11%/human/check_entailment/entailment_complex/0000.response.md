Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Processing**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operation. However, there are some issues with the logic implemented in the function:

   - The function starts by finding the first mismatch between the elements at indices `i` and `j`. If no mismatch is found, it returns 0, indicating that all elements are already equal.
   
   - After finding the first mismatch, the function attempts to skip over consecutive duplicates starting from `i`. This is intended to handle cases where the array has multiple segments of identical values.
   
   - The function then checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If it is not, it returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j` (inclusive), which represents the cost of making all elements in that segment equal to the value at `arr[i]`.

   - If `j` is the last index, the function returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j-1`, which again represents the cost of making all elements in that segment equal to the value at `arr[i]`.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function does not actually ensure that the entire array can be made equal with the minimum cost. It only checks for a specific segment and does not consider other possible segments or the overall structure of the array.
   - The function does not handle cases where the array needs to be split into multiple segments to make all elements equal.
   - The function does not account for the fact that the operation can be applied anywhere in the array, not just between `i` and `j`.

Given these points, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
