Let's analyze the given state and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i <= j:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `i <= j`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1.

### Determining the Next State:
- For the loop to continue, the condition `i <= j` must hold true.
- Since `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `j` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `i` can either be 0 or 1. To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be such that `i <= j` holds true.

Given that `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` can be 0 or 1, and both values satisfy `i <= j`.

### Conclusion:
- No adjustment is needed for `i` because both possible values (0 or 1) satisfy the condition `i <= j`.
- No adjustment is needed for `j` because it remains the length of `arr` minus 1.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1**
