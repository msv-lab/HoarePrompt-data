Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
   - The condition `arr[i] == arr[j]` holds true.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must be true.

4. **Check the current state against the loop condition**:
   - We know that `arr[i] == arr[j]` is true, but this doesn't directly help us determine if `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true.
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only way to ensure the loop executes the first time is to make sure `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true.
   - Since we don't have direct information about `arr[i + 1]`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure that `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
