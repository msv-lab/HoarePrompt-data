Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in `func_1` does not address the core requirement of finding the minimum cost operation to make all elements equal. Instead, it checks if the first and last elements are the same and then performs some operations that do not guarantee the minimum cost.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
4
```

This is correct for this specific example, but the program fails to handle other cases correctly. For instance, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

But the provided program would output:
```
4
```

This is because the program does not correctly identify the minimum cost operation. It only checks if the first and last elements are the same and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal, which could involve multiple operations or different ranges.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
