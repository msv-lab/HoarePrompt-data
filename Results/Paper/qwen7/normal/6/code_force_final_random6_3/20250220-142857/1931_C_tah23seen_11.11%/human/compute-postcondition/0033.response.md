Output State: `i` is equal to `j` or `i + 1` is equal to `j`, and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be incremented until it either equals `j` or `i + 1` becomes equal to `j`. During each iteration, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must hold true, ensuring that `i` continues to increment as long as consecutive elements in the array are equal.
