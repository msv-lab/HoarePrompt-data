Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0 or the length of a specific sequence within the list. If no valid sequence is found, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest sequence where the last element of the sequence matches the first element of the next sequence, with the second-to-last element of the sequence being one position before the start of the next sequence. If no such sequence exists, it returns the length of the sequence where the last element matches the second-to-last element of the list.**
