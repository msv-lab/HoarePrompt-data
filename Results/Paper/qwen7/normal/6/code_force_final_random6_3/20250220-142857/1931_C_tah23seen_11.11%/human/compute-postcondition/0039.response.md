Output State: **The program returns the difference between j (which is the length of `arr` minus one) and i (which is less than j), given that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`**

This means the program calculates and returns the value of `j - i`, where `j` is one less than the length of the list `arr`, and `i` is an index less than `j` such that the elements at indices `i` and `j-1` in the list `arr` are equal.
