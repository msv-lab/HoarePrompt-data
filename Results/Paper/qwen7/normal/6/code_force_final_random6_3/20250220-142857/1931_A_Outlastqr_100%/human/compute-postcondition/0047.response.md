To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions for `word`.

Given:
- `input_value` is an integer.
- `word` can be one of the following: 'zz', 'az', 'aay', or 'aaa'.
- `i` is set to `input_value + 2`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The value of `word` depends on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, then `word = 'zz'`.
- If `28 < n â‰¤ 52`, then `word = 'az'`.
- If `n = 27`, then `word = 'aay'`.
- Otherwise, `word = 'aaa'`.

Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider the possible values of `n` and their corresponding `word` values.

The `print(word)` statement will simply print the current value of `word` based on the conditions described.

Output: **'zz', 'az', 'aay', or 'aaa' depending on the value of n**
