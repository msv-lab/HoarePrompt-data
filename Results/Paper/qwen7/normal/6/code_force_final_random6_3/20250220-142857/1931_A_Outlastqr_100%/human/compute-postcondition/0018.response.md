Postcondition: `n` is an integer and `word` is a string. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is equal to `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is less than or equal to 52, then `word` is 'az' if `n` is greater than 27, 'aay' if `n` is exactly 27, or 'aaa' followed by the nth letter of the alphabet where `n` is less than or equal to 27.
