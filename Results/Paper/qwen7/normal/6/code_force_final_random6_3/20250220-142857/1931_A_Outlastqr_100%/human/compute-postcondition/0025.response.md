Output State: **`input_value` is an integer, `word` is 'az', `i` is `input_value` + 1, `n` is `input_value`**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'az'` to the variable `word`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `word` becomes `'az'`. The values of `input_value`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
