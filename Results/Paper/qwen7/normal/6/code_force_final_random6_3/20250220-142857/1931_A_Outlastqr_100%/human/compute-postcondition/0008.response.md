Output State: **`n` is an input integer with a value less than or equal to 52 and greater than 27, `word` is 'az', `alphabet[n - 28]` is the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet string.**

Explanation: The code appends `'a'`, the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet (which is `alphabet[n - 28]`), and `'z'` to the string `word`. Since `n` is greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, `n - 28` will be between -1 and 24. However, since `alphabet[n - 28]` is used, it implies that `n - 28` should be a valid index in the alphabet string, which means `n` is effectively between 28 and 52. Therefore, the updated `word` is `'az'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet string.
