Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s`. The variables involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `q` must be 0.
   - `ac` is either 1 or 0.
   - `bc` is either 1 or 0.
   - `s` is a non-empty input string.
   - `i` is the first character in the string `s`.
   - If the first character `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first character in `s` at the start of the current iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second character in `s`.
   - The string `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `t`, `q`, `ac`, and `bc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `s`.

- `i` will be the second character in the string `s`.
- `s` remains the same.

Given this, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` must be 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the second character in the string `s`**.
