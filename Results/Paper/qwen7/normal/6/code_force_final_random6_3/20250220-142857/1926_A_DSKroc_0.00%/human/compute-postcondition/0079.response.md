Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` and `t` strings, each consisting of exactly 5 characters ('A' or 'B'), and counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in each string. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters in the string; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each string.**
