Postcondition: `ac` is either 1 or 2, `q` is 2, `bc` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character. If the next character `next_char` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ac` remains the same as the initial value (either 1 or 0) and `bc` is either 0 or 1.
