Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 5000. The variable `ans_f` is a list that contains the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration of the loop. Each `ans` is calculated as the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less. The variable `i` is no longer relevant since the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` is the input integer for each iteration, and `lst` is an empty list after all elements have been processed.

In summary, `t` remains unchanged, `ans_f` contains the cumulative results of `ans` for each iteration, and `lst` is empty.
