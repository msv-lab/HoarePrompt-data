Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n * 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n * 2 + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n * 2 + 1`, it is already greater than `n * 2`, which means the loop will not execute based on the initial state.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than or equal to `n * 2` for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than or equal to n * 2, n is an input integer**
