Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration.
- `lst` is an empty list.
- `i` is incremented in each iteration but its final value depends on the number of iterations, which is not specified.

The print statement `print(i)` will print the value of `i` after all iterations have completed. Since `i` is incremented in each iteration and the number of iterations is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`. However, we know it is an integer that has been incremented multiple times during the iterations.

Given the information, the precise value of `i` is not determinable without knowing the number of iterations, but we can describe it as the final value of `i` after all iterations.

Output: **i (the final value of i after all iterations)**
