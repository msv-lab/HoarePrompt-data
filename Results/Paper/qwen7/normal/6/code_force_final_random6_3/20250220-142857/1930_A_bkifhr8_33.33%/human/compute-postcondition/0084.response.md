Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is within the range 0 to \( n \times 2 \).
   - `t` is the same as before.
   - `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces.
   - If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2 (which was previously `lst[1 * 2]`).
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than \( n \times 2 \).

4. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is within the range 0 to \( n \times 2 \), the loop can continue if `i < n \times 2`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `ans`, and `lst` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

7. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than \( n \times 2 \). After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

8. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same.
   - `lst` remains the same unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `t` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2 (which was previously `lst[1 * 2]`). If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
