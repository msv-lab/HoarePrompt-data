Output State: **`ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` does not contain its first element at index 0, `lst` has been modified to remove the element at index 2**.

Explanation: The code removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is still increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `i` is still less than or equal to `n * 2`, the length of `lst` is still not equal to 2, and `lst` no longer contains its first element at index 0 because the element at index 2 has been removed.
