Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 5000), `ans_f` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration of the loop, and `lst` is an empty list since all elements have been processed according to the conditions inside the loop. The variable `i` is no longer used in the final state but was incremented in each iteration of the loop. The state of `n` is not relevant in the final output state as it is an input for each iteration and gets replaced with new values in each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in ans_f:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is not relevant in the final state but was incremented in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `lst` is an empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
