State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `ans_f` is an empty list** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t)`, which means the loop will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be 0.
4. The variable `ans_f` is mentioned as being an empty list, and this state does not change based on the loop itself but is a given condition before the loop starts.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (to ensure the loop can execute), `i` (initialized to 0), and `ans_f` (remains an empty list).
