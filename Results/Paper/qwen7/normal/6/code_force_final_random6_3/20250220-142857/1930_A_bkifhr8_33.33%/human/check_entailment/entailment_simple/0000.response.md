Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`.
- The program attempts to calculate the maximum score by always choosing the minimum of the first two elements in the list and removing them until the list is empty.
- However, there is a logical error in the loop where it tries to process the list. Specifically, the condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect because the list should be processed in pairs, and the loop should continue until the list has fewer than 2 elements.
- Additionally, the loop does not handle the case where the list has an odd number of elements, which would result in an incorrect score calculation.
- The program also does not sort the list before processing, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen correctly.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct results for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
