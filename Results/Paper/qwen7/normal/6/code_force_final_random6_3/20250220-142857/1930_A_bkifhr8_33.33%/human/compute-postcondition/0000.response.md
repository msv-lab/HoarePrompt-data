Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the precondition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000` still holds.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer, `t` is now an integer. The precondition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000` is maintained because the input is read from the user, and the problem statement guarantees that the input will be within this range. All other variables (`n` and the list `a`) remain undefined and their preconditions (that `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`) are still valid but not yet set.
