Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of integers including t, n, and a sequence of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. It returns a result based on the conditions where t ranges from 1 to 5000, n ranges from 1 to 50, and each a_i ranges from 1 to 10^7.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters through a predefined structure (t, n, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}) with specified constraints and returns a result based on these inputs.
