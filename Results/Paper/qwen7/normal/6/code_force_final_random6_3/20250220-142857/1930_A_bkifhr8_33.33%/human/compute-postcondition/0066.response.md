Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n * 2`, `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst`, and `lst` will be empty or contain fewer elements than it did initially, with all pairs processed according to the loop conditions.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach `n * 2`, indicating that the loop has executed exactly `n * 2` times. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values between each pair of elements taken from the list `lst`, as long as the list contains at least two elements. The list `lst` will be modified such that any pairs of elements have been processed, and if the list length was originally even, it will now be empty or contain fewer than two elements. If the list length was odd, it will contain a single element left unpaired.
