Output State: **`i` is (n * 2) + 1, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is 0, and `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than it did initially.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This affects only the `ans` variable, setting it to 0. The other variables (`i`, `t`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
