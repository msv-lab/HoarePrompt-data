Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is an empty list, and either the element at index 0 in `lst` is removed or the most internal loop or if statement is broken, provided `n` must be greater than 0.
