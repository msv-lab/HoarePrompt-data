Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and `n` is the input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` will be equal to `n * 2`, `ans_f` will contain the latest value of `ans`, and `lst` will be empty or contain fewer elements than it did initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now greater than `n * 2`; the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially; the list `lst` no longer contains any elements that were removed during the loop's execution; `ans_f` is appended with the value of `ans`, which is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` until the condition `len(lst) != 2` no longer holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
