Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, `queries` will be a list of integers from the final input, `n` will be the first integer from the final input, `q` will be the second integer from the final input, `operations` will be updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), and `result` will be the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (i.e., `t` becomes 0), the final values of `n`, `q`, and `operations` will be based on the last set of inputs provided, and `queries` will also reflect the last set of queries. The `result` will be the outcome of processing these final inputs through the function `func_1`.
