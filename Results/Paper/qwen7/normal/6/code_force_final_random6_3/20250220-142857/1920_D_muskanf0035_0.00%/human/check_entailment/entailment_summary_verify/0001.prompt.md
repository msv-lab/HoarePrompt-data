You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes integers `n` and `q`, a list of `n` operations, and a list of `q` queries. It processes `n` operations on an array and then answers `q` queries based on the final state of the array after all operations are applied. The function prints the results of the queries for each set of inputs.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `array` is initialized.
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation, if the operation type is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, the entire `array` is extended with itself `x` times.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, the `(k - 1)`-th element of the `array` (considering 0-based indexing) is computed using modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array due to repeated extensions.
   - The result is appended to the `result` list.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The operations are read and stored in a list.
   - The queries are read and stored in a list.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - The results are printed.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations (appending a single value and extending the array).
   - However, there is a critical issue with how the array is extended. The current implementation extends the array with itself `x` times, but it should only extend it with the current state of the array, not the initial array.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The modulo operation used to access the array elements is correct for handling the cyclic nature of the array due to repeated extensions.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement to identify the issue.

#### Example 1:
- **Operations**: 
  - `1 1`: Append 1
  - `1 2`: Append 2
  - `2 1`: Extend with the current array (which is [1, 2])
  - `1 3`: Append 3
  - `2 3`: Extend with the current array (which is [1, 2, 1, 2]) three times

- **Array State**:
  - After `1 1`: `[1]`
  - After `1 2`: `[1, 2]`
  - After `2 1`: `[1, 2, 1, 2]`
  - After `1 3`: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
  - After `2 3`: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

- **Queries**:
  - `1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20`

- **Expected Output**:
  - `1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3`

The function `func_1` incorrectly extends the array with the initial array instead of the current state of the array. This leads to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the extension of the array. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
