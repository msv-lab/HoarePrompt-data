Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the return value of this function call. All other variables (`queries`, `n`, `q`, and `operations`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
