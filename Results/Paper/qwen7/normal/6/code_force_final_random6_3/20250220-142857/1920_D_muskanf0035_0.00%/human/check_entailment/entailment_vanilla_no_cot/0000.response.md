Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it handles the operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the operations as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Operation Handling**: 
   - When an operation of type 1 is performed, the integer \( x \) should be appended to the array.
   - When an operation of type 2 is performed, the array should be extended by appending \( x \) copies of itself.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` only extends the array by repeating its current contents without considering the history of operations. This means it does not correctly simulate the operations as described.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly simulate the operations, we need to maintain a history of the array states after each operation and use this history to answer the queries accurately. Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
def func_1(n, operations):
    array = []
    history = []  # To store the state of the array after each operation
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
            history.append(array.copy())  # Store the current state of the array
        else:
            array.extend(history[-1] * value)  # Extend the array with x copies of the last state
            history.append(array.copy())  # Store the new state of the array
    return array

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        array = func_1(n, operations)
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = [array[k-1] for k in queries]
        print(*result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected implementation maintains the history of the array states and uses it to extend the array correctly when an operation of type 2 is performed. This ensures that the final array state is accurate and can be queried properly.
