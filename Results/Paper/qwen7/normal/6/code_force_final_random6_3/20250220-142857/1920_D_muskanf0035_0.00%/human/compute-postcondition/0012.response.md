Based on the initial state provided:

- `queries` is a list of integers.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list unpacked. Since the exact values of `queries`, `n`, `q`, and `operations` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the return value of the function `func_1`, which processes `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Given the information, the output will be a list of results from the function `func_1`, but without the specific implementation details of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values.

Output: **[result elements]** (where result is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` and contains the processed outcomes based on the given inputs)
