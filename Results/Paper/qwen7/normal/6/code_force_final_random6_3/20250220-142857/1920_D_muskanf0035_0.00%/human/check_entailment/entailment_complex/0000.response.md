Reasoning:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` with the necessary parameters.
- `func_1` processes the operations to build the array and then answers the queries based on the final state of the array.

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
1. It correctly handles both types of operations:
   - When `op_type` is 1, it appends the value to the array.
   - When `op_type` is 2, it extends the array by repeating its current elements `x` times.
2. After processing all operations, it correctly answers the queries by indexing into the final array.

Now let's consider the overall correctness:
- The problem description specifies that the array starts empty and operations are performed in a specific sequence.
- `func_1` correctly simulates these operations and builds the array accordingly.
- The queries are answered based on the final state of the array, which is correctly constructed by `func_1`.

Given that `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and handles the input/output as specified, and `func_1` correctly processes the operations and answers the queries, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
