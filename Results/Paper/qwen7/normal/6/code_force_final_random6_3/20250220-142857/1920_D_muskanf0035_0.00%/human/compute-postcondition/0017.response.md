Output State: **`queries` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `operations` is updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` and assigns its return value to `result`. The function call itself does not modify the values of `queries`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, or `t` directly. Instead, it returns a value which is stored in `result`. The values of `queries`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `t` is decreased by 1 due to the operation `t -= 1` (which is implied by the given code snippet).
