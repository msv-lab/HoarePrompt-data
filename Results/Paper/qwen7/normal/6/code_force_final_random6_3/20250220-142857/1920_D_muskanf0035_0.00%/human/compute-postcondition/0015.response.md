Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `operations` is updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\), and stores them in the list `operations`. The values of `queries`, `n`, `q`, `result`, `t` remain unchanged except that `operations` is now populated with the new values.
