You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: operations is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value). op_type is either 1 or 2, indicating the type of operation. If op_type is 1, value is an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the integer to append to the array. If op_type is 2, value is an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the number of copies to append to the array. queries is a list of integers k_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is a list where elements are either appended based on the operation type or repeated twice depending on previous operations, `result` is an empty list, and `operations` is an empty list after all iterations.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
    #- The `array` will contain elements that were appended when `op_type` was 1, or those elements will be repeated twice if they were previously extended (based on the second part of the loop body).
    #- The `result` remains an empty list as no values are added to it within the loop.
    #- The `operations` list becomes empty since all operations have been processed.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: The `result` list will contain all elements from `array` that correspond to the indices specified by `queries`. The `array` and `operations` lists will be empty since no new elements are appended to `array` and all operations are processed.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list 'result' since no elements are added to it and all operations are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of operations to modify an array and then generates a result list based on given queries. Specifically, it appends integers to or repeats elements in the array according to the operation type. After processing all operations, it creates a result list by indexing into the modified array using the provided queries, and finally returns an empty list since no elements are added to the result list during the process.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.

        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, `queries` will be a list of integers from the final input, `n` will be the first integer from the final input, `q` will be the second integer from the final input, `operations` will be updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), and `result` will be the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes integers `n` and `q`, a list of `n` operations, and a list of `q` queries. It processes `n` operations on an array and then answers `q` queries based on the final state of the array after all operations are applied. The function prints the results of the queries for each set of inputs.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly simulate the appending of the array multiple times as required by the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Operation Handling**: When an operation of type 2 is encountered, the current implementation extends the array by repeating its elements, but it does not account for the number of copies `x`. Instead, it simply repeats the entire array, which is incorrect.

2. **Query Handling**: The function calculates the result for each query using the modulo operation, which assumes the array size is the length of the current array. However, the actual array size can be much larger due to the repeated appending, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 10
  1 1
  1 2
  2 1
  1 3
  2 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3
  ```

- **Actual Output** (using the provided code):
  ```
  1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3
  ```

While this specific example seems to work correctly, the code fails to handle the case where the number of copies `x` is large. For instance, if the number of copies is very large, the array will grow exponentially, and the modulo operation will not accurately reflect the position of the queried element.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)
    result = []
    for k in queries:
        index = (k - 1) % len(array)
        result.append(array[index])
    return result
```

This corrected function properly handles the repeated appending of the array and should produce the correct results for all inputs.
