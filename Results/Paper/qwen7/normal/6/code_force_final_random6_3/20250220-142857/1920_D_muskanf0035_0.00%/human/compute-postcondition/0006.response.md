Based on the initial state provided:

- `queries` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `queries` is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c).
- `result` is the result of calling `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `result`. However, we know that `result` is derived from processing `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Output: **result (where result is the output of func_1(n, operations, queries))**
