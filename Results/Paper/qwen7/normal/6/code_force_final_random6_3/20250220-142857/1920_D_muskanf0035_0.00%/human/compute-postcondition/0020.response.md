The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `q`: an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5.
- `operations`: a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `queries`: a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.

Based on the input parameters, the function performs a series of operations defined in the `operations` list on an initial array and then answers a series of queries defined in the `queries` list. The operations involve modifying elements of the array, and the queries ask for specific values in the array after all operations have been applied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`, perform the specified operations on an array, and answer the queries based on the modified array.
