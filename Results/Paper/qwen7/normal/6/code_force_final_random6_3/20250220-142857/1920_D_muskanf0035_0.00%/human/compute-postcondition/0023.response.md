Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `k`, which iterates over the `queries` list.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `queries` list.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `queries` is a non-empty list or iterable.
   - The `result` list has one additional element, which is the same as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `queries`, the first element of `queries` (let's call it `k`) is used in each iteration.
   - After processing one element from `queries`, the `queries` list should have one fewer element.
   - The `result` list will have one additional element based on the current value of `k`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `queries` will have one fewer element than before.
- `result` will have one additional element based on the new value of `k`.

Since `k` is the current element being processed in the loop, and `queries` is reduced by one element after each iteration, we need to reflect this in the state.

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- `queries` will now be a non-empty list or iterable with one fewer element.
- `result` will have one additional element, which is the same as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, where `k` is the new value of the first element in the updated `queries` list.

**Final State**:
- `queries` is a non-empty list or iterable with one fewer element.
- `result` is a list with one additional element which is the same as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, where `k` is the new value of the first element in the updated `queries` list.

**State:**
**`queries` is a non-empty list or iterable with one fewer element, `result` is a list with one additional element which is the same as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`**
