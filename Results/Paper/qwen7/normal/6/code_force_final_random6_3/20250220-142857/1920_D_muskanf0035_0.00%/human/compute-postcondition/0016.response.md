Output State: **`queries` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `operations` is updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual integers, and assigns these integers to the `queries` list, with the first integer assigned to `n` and the second integer assigned to `q`. The `operations` list and `result` are not directly modified by this line of code, and `t` is not defined before this line, so its value being decreased by 1 is also noted.
