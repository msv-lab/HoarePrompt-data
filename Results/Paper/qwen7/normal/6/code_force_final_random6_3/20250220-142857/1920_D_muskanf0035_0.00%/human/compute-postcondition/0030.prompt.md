You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: operations is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value). op_type is either 1 or 2, indicating the type of operation. If op_type is 1, value is an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the integer to append to the array. If op_type is 2, value is an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the number of copies to append to the array. queries is a list of integers k_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is a list where elements are either appended based on the operation type or repeated twice depending on previous operations, `result` is an empty list, and `operations` is an empty list after all iterations.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
    #- The `array` will contain elements that were appended when `op_type` was 1, or those elements will be repeated twice if they were previously extended (based on the second part of the loop body).
    #- The `result` remains an empty list as no values are added to it within the loop.
    #- The `operations` list becomes empty since all operations have been processed.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: The `result` list will contain all elements from `array` that correspond to the indices specified by `queries`. The `array` and `operations` lists will be empty since no new elements are appended to `array` and all operations are processed.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list 'result' since no elements are added to it and all operations are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `n` is an integer, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and `queries` is a list of integers k_i. The function processes the operations and queries but does not add any elements to the array, returning an empty list 'result'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty list 'result' since no elements are added to it and all operations are processed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
