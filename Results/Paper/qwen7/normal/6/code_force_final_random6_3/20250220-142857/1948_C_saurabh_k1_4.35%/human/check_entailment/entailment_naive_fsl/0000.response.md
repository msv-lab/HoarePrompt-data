Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This check is insufficient because the robot's movement is determined by both the current and subsequent arrows, not just the second-to-last one.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and follows the arrows:
1. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) due to the arrow `>` in the first row.
2. From (1, 2) to (2, 2) due to the arrow `<` in the second row.
3. From (2, 2) to (2, 3) due to the arrow `>` in the second row.
4. From (2, 3) to (2, 4) due to the arrow `<` in the second row.

The robot successfully reaches (2, 4), but the program incorrectly prints 'No' because `b[n - 2]` (which is `>` in this case) does not match the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and is thus incorrect.
