Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are:
   - `_`: A placeholder variable used for iteration (we don't care about its specific value).
   - `int(input())`: This is the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - After each iteration, the input will be taken again, changing the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
   - The value of `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is driven by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` will change with each iteration.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can continue to execute, which means `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Given these points, let's determine the state adjustments:

- The value of `int(input())` will decrease by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `int(input())` is now one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and the value of `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, and `int(input())` is the remaining number of iterations which is one less than the previous value.**

To be more precise, if the previous value of `int(input())` was `k`, then the new value should be `k - 1`.

So, the state can be represented as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and the value of `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, and `int(input())` is the remaining number of iterations which is one less than the previous value.**
