You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes the width n of the grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even), followed by two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer reduced to 0 after all iterations, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the last input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the last input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in the grid. The robot must follow the arrows and move within the grid boundaries.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code takes the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and the arrows in both rows.
   - It then checks if the last but one column's arrow in the second row (`b[n-2]`) is pointing left (`<`).
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code does not correctly simulate the movement of the robot. The robot needs to move both horizontally and vertically based on the arrows, and the current implementation only checks the direction of the arrow in the last but one column of the second row.
   - The robot can potentially reach the last column of the second row from different positions and with different sequences of movements, not just based on the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last column.
   - The code fails to account for the robot's movement in both rows and columns, and it does not consider the possibility of the robot reaching the last column of the second row through valid sequences of moves.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided code does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not check all necessary conditions for the robot to reach the target cell, the given program is incorrect.
