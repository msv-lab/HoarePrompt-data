Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes the width n of the grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even), followed by two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and the value of `b[n - 2]` is either '<' or not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is updated to be a list of strings converted from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer reduced by 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from new input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input. Regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals '<' or not, the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
