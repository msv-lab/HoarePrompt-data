Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and the value of `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, and `int(input())` is the remaining number of iterations which is one less than the previous value.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `b`) remain unchanged. The condition that `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'` remains valid. Additionally, the remaining number of iterations is specified to be one less than the previous value, which is represented by `int(input())`.
