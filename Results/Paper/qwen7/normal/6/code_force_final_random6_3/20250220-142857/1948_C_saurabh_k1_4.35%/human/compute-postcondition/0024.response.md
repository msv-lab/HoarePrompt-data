Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer reduced by 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from new input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input. Regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals '<' or not, the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
