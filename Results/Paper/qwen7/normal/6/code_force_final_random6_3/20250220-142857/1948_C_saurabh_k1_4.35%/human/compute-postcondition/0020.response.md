Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer reduced by 1, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is now a list of strings converted from the input using `map(str, input())`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input from the user, converts each character of the input into a string, and stores these strings in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
