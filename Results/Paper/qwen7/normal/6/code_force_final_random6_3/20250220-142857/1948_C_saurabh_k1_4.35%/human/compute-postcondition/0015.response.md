Output: **No**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, the variable `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^4\). The variable `n` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. Additionally, it is mentioned that `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`. The variable `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, and `b` is updated to be a list of strings converted from the input. The `print('No')` statement simply outputs the string `'No'` without any dependency on the values of other variables. Therefore, the output is exactly `'No'`.
