Output State: **`cw` is `True`, `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `cw`. This changes the value of `cw` but does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the sum of the list `nums` (`ls`), the value of `t`, `N`, `n`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
