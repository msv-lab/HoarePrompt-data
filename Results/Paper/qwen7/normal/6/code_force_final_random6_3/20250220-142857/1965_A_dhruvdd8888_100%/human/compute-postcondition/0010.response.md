Output State: **`ls` is `nums[0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers (converted from the original set `nums`), `i` is 2, and `nums[i]` is decreased by `nums[0]`**.

In natural language: The value of `ls` remains the same as `nums[0]`. The variable `t` and `N` remain unchanged. The variable `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` also remain unchanged. The list `nums` is still a sorted list of integers converted from the original set `nums`. The variable `i` is still 2. The element `nums[i]` (which is `nums[2]`) has been decreased by the value of `nums[0]`.
