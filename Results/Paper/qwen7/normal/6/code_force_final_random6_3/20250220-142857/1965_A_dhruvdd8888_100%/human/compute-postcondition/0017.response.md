Output State: **`nw` is set to True, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `nums[i]` is not accessed since `i` equals the length of `nums`.**

Explanation: The variable `nw` is assigned the value `True`, which changes its state from its initial undefined state to `True`. All other variables remain in their initial or updated states as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet. The variable `i` remains equal to the length of `nums` because the loop condition `nw` is set to `True` without any further loop iterations.
