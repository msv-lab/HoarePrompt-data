Output State: **`nw` is not `cw`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `nw` to `not nw`. Since `nw` was initially equal to `cw`, now `nw` is not equal to `cw`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
