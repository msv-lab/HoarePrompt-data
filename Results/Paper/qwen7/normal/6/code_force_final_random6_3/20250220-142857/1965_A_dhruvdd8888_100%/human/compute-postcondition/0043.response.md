Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the length of a list, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
