Output State: **`cw` is `not nw`, `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the logical negation of `nw`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
