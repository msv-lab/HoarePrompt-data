Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1` (since `i` starts at `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 each iteration).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nw` is equal to `cw`
   - `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `N` is an input integer
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers
   - `i` is at least 2

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`nw` is equal to `cw`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is 1**
