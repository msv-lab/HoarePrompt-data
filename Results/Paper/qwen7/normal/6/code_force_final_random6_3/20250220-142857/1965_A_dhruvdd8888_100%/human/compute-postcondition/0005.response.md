State: **`ls` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a sorted list of integers (converted from the original set `nums`), `i` is 0, and '0' is included in the sorted list.**
