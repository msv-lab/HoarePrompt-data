Output State: **`nw` is set to True, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `cw` is set to True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `cw`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
