Output State: **`nw` is equal to `cw`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is at least 2.**

Explanation: The line `nw = cw` simply assigns the current value of `cw` to `nw`. This does not affect the values of `ls`, `t`, `N`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `nums`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
