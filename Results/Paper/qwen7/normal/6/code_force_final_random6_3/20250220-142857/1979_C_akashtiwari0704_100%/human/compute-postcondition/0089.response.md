Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`. Therefore, the loop can continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 and is now `i + 1`.
   - `l` is a non-empty list.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than the length of `l`. Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `len(l)`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `g` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
- `l` remains a non-empty list because it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is a non-empty list**
