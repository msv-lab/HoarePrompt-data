Output State: **`sumo` is the original value plus `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than `i`, `T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`**.

In this output state, the value of `sumo` remains the same as its original value plus `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`. The condition that `bets` must be greater than `i` still holds. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `i`, `l`, and `prod` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `a[i]` is now updated to `prod // a[i]`.
