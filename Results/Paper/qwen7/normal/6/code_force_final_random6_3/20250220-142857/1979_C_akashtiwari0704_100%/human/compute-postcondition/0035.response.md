Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(bets):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans` is equal to `str(a[1]) + ' '`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `bets` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `bets` stays the same.
   - The variable `ans` is not part of the loop head and its value does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` needs to be 3 for the loop to continue.
   - `bets` remains the same (though the exact value is not given, it doesn't change).
   - `ans` remains `str(a[1]) + ' '`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `bets` must be greater than 3, `ans` is equal to `str(a[1]) + ' '`**
