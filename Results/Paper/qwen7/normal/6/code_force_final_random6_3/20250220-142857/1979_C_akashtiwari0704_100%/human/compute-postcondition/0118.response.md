Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans` is 'a[0]a[1] '; `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the value of `ans` by appending `str(a[i])` (which is `a[1]` since `i` was initially 1 and has now been incremented to 2) followed by a space. The value of `i` is incremented from 1 to 2. The value of `bets` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.
