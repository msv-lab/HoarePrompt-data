Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[3]`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[3]`. The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`) remains unchanged and is still equal to `prod // a[3]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain the same.
