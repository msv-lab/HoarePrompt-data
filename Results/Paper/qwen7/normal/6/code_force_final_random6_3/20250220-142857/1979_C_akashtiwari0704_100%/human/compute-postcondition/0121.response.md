Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * (bets - 1)`, `ans` is the concatenation of `'a[i] '` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `bets` must be greater than or equal to 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to twice the value of `bets` minus 2. The string `ans` will contain the values of all elements `a[i]` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` concatenated together with spaces in between. This means if `bets` is `n`, then `ans` will be a string like `'a[0] a[1] ... a[n-1]'`.
