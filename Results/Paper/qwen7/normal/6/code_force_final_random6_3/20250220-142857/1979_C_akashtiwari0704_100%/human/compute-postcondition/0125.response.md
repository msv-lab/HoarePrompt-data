Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `T` will be equal to the total number of iterations `t`, `bets` will be a positive integer representing the total number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` will be the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each iteration, each element `a[i]` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, and `ans` will be the concatenation of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces if `sumo < prod`; otherwise, `sumo` will be the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.

This means that after all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` inputs, updating the list `a` and calculating `sumo` based on the updated values. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the final `ans` will contain the updated values of `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the loop will print `-1` and `ans` will not be printed.
