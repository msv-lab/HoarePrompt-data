Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `i` remains unchanged, meaning its value before the loop starts will be the same as its initial value.
   - `bets` is an input integer, so its value is known.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Initial state of `i`**: Since `i` remains unchanged and the loop starts with `i` being 0 (as is typical for `range` in Python), `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

5. **Loop execution condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `bets`. Given that `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `bets` is greater than 0.

6. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `bets` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `bets` and `i`. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
