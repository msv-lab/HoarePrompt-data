Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`
   - `i` is 0
   - `l` must have at least 1 element

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the length of the list `l`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is 0, the condition `i < len(l)` must hold true for the loop to execute again.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `g` remains unchanged as it was updated in the previous iteration and no further updates are mentioned.
   - The list `l` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to proceed.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `g` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - `l` must still have at least 1 element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `i` is 1, `l` must have at least 1 element**
