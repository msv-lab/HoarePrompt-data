Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `2 * (bets - 1)`
- `ans` is the concatenation of `'a[i] '` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`
- `bets` must be the final value it was set to after all iterations

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i = 2 * (bets - 1)`
   - This means `i` is twice the final value of `bets` minus 2.

2. **Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is constructed by concatenating `'a[i] '` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
   - This implies that `ans` will be a string where each element `a[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `bets-1` is concatenated with a space.

Given these points, the print statement will output the string `ans`, which contains the elements of the array `a` from index `0` to `bets-1`, separated by spaces.

Output: **a[0] a[1] ... a[bets-2] a[bets-1]**
