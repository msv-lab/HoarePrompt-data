Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `l`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `i` is less than the length of `l`.
   - `l` is a non-empty list.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than the length of `l`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `g` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- `l` remains the same as it is a list that does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is less than the length of `l`, `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

However, to fit the exact format required, we need to ensure `i` is explicitly stated as being less than the length of `l` again for clarity.

**State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than the length of `l`, `l` is a non-empty list**.
