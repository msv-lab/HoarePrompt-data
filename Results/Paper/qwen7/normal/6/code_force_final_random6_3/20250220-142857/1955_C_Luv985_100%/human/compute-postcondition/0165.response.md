Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` to integers using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
