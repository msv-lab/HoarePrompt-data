Postcondition: `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1, and either `a[l]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `mi`, `l` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` equals 0, or `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
