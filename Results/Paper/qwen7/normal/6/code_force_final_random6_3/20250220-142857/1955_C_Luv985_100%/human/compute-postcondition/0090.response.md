Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The code `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
