Output State: **`T` is now `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element may have been decremented multiple times, `l` is equal to `r`, indicating that the left pointer has caught up to the right pointer, `r` is equal to `l`, indicating that the right pointer has caught up to the left pointer, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `k = int(k)` converts the value of `k` (which was initially 0) to an integer, but since `k` was already an integer (0), its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
