Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is 1 less than its original value, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
