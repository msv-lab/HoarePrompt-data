Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` to integers using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi` and if `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 (or 0) and we break out of the nearest enclosing loop or block.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r])`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi` if `a[r]` does not equal 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, and `t` is `k % 2` where we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is either decreased by `2 * mi` or remains unchanged, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
