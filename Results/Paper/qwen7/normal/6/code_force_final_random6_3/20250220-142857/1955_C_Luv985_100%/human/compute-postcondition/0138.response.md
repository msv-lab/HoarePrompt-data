Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is increased by 1, `l` < `r`.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `k` is still decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is still `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is still `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is still `ans + 1`, `mi` is still the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the condition `l < r` remains true.
