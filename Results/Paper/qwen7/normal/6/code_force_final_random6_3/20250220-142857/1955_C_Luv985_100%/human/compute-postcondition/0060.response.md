Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is greater than `l`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The values of `k`, `mi`, `l`, `r`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
