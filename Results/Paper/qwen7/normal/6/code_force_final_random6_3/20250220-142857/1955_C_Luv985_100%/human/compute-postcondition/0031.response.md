Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to `mi * 2`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `t = k % 2` assigns the value of `k % 2` to the variable `t`. Since `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to `mi * 2`, `t` will be the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
