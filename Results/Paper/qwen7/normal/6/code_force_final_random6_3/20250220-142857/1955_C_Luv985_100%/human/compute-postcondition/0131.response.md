Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted based on the conditions within the if-else block, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions within the if-else block, `ans` is increased by 1 under certain conditions, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0. Specifically, if `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is set to 2, `r` is set to `n - 3`, and `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is increased by 1, `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
