Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` < `r`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`**

Explanation: The code subtracts `mi` from `a[r]`. Since `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is already adjusted to `a[l] - mi`, the value of `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
