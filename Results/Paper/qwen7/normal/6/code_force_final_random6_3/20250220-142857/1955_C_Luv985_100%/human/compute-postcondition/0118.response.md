Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either `ans + 1` or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r] - mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
