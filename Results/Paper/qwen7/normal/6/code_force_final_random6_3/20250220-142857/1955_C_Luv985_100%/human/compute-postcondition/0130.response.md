Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (`k - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `t = k % 2` and `k` remains unchanged), `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the condition in the else part is met, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is updated to `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0.
