Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either `ans + 1` or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= mi * 2` decreases the value of `k` by `2 * mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, which does not change during the execution of this line of code.
