Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using `map` and `lambda`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0 or `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi` and `a[r]` remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1, and if `mi * 2 > k`, `k` is reduced to `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0 or remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and if `mi * 2 > k`, `k` is reduced to `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1, and either `a[l]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `mi`, `l` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` equals 0, or `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
