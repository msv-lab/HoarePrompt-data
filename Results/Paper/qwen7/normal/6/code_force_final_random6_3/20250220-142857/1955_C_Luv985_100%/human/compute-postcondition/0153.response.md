Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted based on the final conditions within the loop, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` and `r` are such that they are either pointing to positions where elements are zero or are out of bounds, `ans` holds the total count of zeros added to it during the process, `mi` is the minimum value between the last two non-zero elements considered in the loop, and `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2 if `k` is still positive. Additionally, the condition `l == r` is true.**
