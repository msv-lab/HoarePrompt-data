Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` to integers using map and lambda, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Currently, `a[r]` is 0.**
