Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 3 (incremented by 1 from 2 when `a[r]` equals 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r-1])`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`. If `a[r]` does not equal 0, `l` remains 1, `ans` remains 2, and `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`.**
