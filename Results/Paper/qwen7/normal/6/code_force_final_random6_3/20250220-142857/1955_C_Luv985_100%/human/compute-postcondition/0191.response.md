To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```python
while l < r and k > 0:
```

This means the loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `l < r`
2. `k > 0`

### Current State:
- `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `k` is an integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `ans` is either 1 or 2.
- `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to continue executing, both `l < r` and `k > 0` must be true.

1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to remain true, `r` should not become less than or equal to `l`.

2. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - Currently, `k` is greater than 0.
   - For `k > 0` to remain true, `k` should not become zero or negative.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure `l < r` remains true, `r` should not decrease to a value less than or equal to `l`. Since `l` is fixed at 0, `r` must stay greater than 0.
- To ensure `k > 0` remains true, `k` should not be reduced to zero or below.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop continues is `r`. `r` must be greater than 0.
- No other states need to be adjusted based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`**.
