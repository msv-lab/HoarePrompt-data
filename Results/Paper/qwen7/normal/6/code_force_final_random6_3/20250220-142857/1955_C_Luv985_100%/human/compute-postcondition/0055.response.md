Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.
2. **Determine which states affect the loop condition**:
   - `l < r`: This condition depends on the values of `l` and `r`.
   - `k > 0`: This condition depends on the value of `k`.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `T` is `T - 1`: This state does not affect the loop condition.
   - `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1: This state does not affect the loop condition.
   - `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi`: This state affects the `k > 0` condition.
   - `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`: This state does not directly affect the loop condition but might indirectly affect `l` and `r` if `a[l]` becomes zero.
   - `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`: This state affects the value of `mi`, which is used in the reduction of `k`.
   - `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0 or remains unchanged: This state affects the value of `a[r]`, which is used in the calculation of `mi`.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1: This state does not affect the loop condition.
   - `l` must be less than `r`: This state does not change during the loop body, so it does not need adjustment.
   - `r` is decreased by 1: This state affects the `l < r` condition.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`, `k` is reduced to `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited: This state does not affect the loop condition directly but might indirectly affect `k`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure `l < r` holds true, `r` should be greater than `l`.
   - To ensure `k > 0` holds true, `k` should be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` and `k`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`r` must be greater than `l`, `k` must be greater than 0**
