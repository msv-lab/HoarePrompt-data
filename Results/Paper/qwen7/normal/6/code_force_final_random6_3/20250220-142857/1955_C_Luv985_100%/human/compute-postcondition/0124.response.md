Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
