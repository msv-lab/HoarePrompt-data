Output State: **`i` is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is now equal to `m`, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

This means that the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the maximum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, while the other variables retain their previous states.
