Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1, meaning the list `a` has at least 2 elements.

The print statement `print(a[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, it will print the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **[second element of list a]**
