Postcondition: `i` is an integer that is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the value at index `i` in `a` is replaced by `n`, and `m` is the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `n`, while `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `n`. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `a` is set to `m`, which is the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, where `b` is a list with the same elements as `a` except that the value at index `i` is replaced by `n`.
