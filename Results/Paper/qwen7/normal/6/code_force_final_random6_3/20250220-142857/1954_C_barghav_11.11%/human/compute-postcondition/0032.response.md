Output State: **`i` is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `m`. The values of `i`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `m` is introduced with the value being the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
