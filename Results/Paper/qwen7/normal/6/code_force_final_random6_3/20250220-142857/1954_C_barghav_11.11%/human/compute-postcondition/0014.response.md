Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of the list `a` minus one, `a[i]` is updated to `m`, where `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is updated to `n`, where `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `i` is greater than half the length of the list `a` minus one, `a[i]` is updated to `m`, where `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` (which is now `m`) and `b[i]`.
