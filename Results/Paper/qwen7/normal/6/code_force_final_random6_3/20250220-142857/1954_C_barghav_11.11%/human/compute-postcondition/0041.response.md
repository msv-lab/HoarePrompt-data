Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 0

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - Therefore, `len(a)` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `len(a)` must still be greater than 1.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` must be greater than 1**
