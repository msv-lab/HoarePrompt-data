Output State: **`i` is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is now equal to `n`, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] = n` updates the value of `b` at index `i` to `n`. The value of `i` remains one more than its previous value, and the value of `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, which now is `max(a[i], n)`.
