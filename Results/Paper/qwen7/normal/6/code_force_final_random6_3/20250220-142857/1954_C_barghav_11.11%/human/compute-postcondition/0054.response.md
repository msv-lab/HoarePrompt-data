Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 2.
2. `b` is described as a non-empty list with at least 2 elements. Since it's a list, `b[i]` refers to the element at index 2 (the third element if the list starts counting from 1).
3. The `print` statement uses `end=''` to prevent adding a newline after the printed content, but this does not affect the content being printed.
4. Given that `b` has at least 2 elements, let's denote the elements of `b` as `b[0]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]`, ..., `b[n]` where `n` is the length of the list minus 1.
5. The print statement accesses `b[i]`, which is `b[2]` since `i` is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the third element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[2]**
