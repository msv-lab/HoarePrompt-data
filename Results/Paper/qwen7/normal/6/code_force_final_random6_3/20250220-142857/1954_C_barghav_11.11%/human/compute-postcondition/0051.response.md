Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is a non-empty list.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (though not explicitly shown, it is implied), after the previous iteration where `i` was 0, `i` will now be 1.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`. Since `i` is now 1, the condition will depend on the length of `b`. 

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: To ensure the loop continues, `len(b)` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `b` must still be a non-empty list, but specifically, it must have at least 2 elements.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements**.
