Functionality: **The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings consist of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. It then transforms these strings into lists of integers. The function swaps the elements in the first half of the lists such that the smaller value moves to the second list and the larger value remains in the first list. For the second half of the lists, the elements are swapped in reverse order, meaning the larger value moves to the second list and the smaller value remains in the first list. Finally, the function prints the modified lists of integers.**
