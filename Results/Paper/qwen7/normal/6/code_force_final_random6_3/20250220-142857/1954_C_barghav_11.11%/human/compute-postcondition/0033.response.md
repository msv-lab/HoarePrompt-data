Output State: **`i` is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is now `n`, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

This means that the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `n`, while `i` is still one more than its previous value. The value of `m` is recalculated as the maximum between the new value of `a[i]` (which is `n`) and the previous value of `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
