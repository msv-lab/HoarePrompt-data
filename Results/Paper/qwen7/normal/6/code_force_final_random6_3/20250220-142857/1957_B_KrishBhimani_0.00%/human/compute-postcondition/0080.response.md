Output State: **`arr` is [0, 1, 3], `i` is 4, `c` is the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is now `k >> 1` (which means `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift), `k0` is equal to `k` and must be even.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 3, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The other variables (`arr`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `k0`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
