Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 2, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and 2, and the fourth element is 16, and the fifth element is 2 raised to the power of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends `1 << i` (which is equivalent to `2**i`) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is the first element of `arr`, and the initial state of `ans` is `[1, 1, 2, 16]`, after executing the code, `ans` will become `[1, 1, 2, 16, 2**i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
