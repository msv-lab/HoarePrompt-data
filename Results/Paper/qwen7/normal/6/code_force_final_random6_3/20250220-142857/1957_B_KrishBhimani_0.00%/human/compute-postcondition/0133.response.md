Output State: **`arr` is a list containing [1, 4], `i` is 4, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer, and `k` must be at least 2; `k` is now `k >> 1`**.

This means that the value of `k` has been right-shifted by 1 bit, which effectively divides `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
