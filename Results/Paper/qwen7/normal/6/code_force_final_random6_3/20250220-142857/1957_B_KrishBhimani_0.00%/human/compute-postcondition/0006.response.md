Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is non-zero.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition is `k`, so the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be non-zero.

Given the current state, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `k` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `k` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be non-zero, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0**
