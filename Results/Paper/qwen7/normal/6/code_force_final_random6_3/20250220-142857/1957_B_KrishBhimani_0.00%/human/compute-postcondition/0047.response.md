Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and `k0 - (1 + 1 + (k0 - (1 + 1))), and the fourth element is 2^4, the third element of `ans` is appended with `k0 - sum(ans)` which is `k0 - (1 + 1 + (k0 - 2)) = 2**.**

In simpler terms: `arr` remains unchanged, `i` remains the first element of `arr`, `c` remains `n + 1`, `ans` is now a list with the first three elements being 1, 1, and `k0 - 2`, and the fourth element is `2^4`. The third element of `ans` is updated to `k0 - (1 + 1 + (k0 - 2)) = 2`.
