Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `i` is the last element in `arr` (which is now the last element in an empty list, hence undefined), `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `arr` as an empty list. This means that `arr` no longer contains any elements, making `i` undefined since there is no last element in an empty list. The values of `c`, `ans`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
