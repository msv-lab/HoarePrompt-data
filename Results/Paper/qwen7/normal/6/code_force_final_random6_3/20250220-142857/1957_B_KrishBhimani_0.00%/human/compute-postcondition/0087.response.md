Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is `k0 + 1`, `c` is `n - 1`, `ans` contains the value `k0 - sum(ans)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `sum(ans)` is the sum of all elements currently in `ans`, and initially `ans` is empty (implied by the precondition), `sum(ans)` is 0. Therefore, the first element appended to `ans` is `k0 - 0`, which is simply `k0`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
