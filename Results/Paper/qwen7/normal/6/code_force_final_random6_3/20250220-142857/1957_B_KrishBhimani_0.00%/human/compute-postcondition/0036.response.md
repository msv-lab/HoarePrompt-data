Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 1, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list with one element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `n-1` to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
