The loop condition is `while k:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `k` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is equal to `k0` divided by 2.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` is still non-zero. Given that `k` was set to `k0 / 2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` must still be greater than 0. 

Since `k0` is a positive integer (as `t` is a positive integer and `k0` is derived from `t`), `k0 / 2` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `k` will be non-zero until it reaches 0 through repeated divisions by 2.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` itself, ensuring it remains non-zero for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` must be non-zero, `arr` is a list containing the integer `0`, `i` is 1**
