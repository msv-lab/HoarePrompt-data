Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the second last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `i = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `k0` remain unchanged from their initial states.
