Output State: `arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 2, `ans` is a list with as many elements as there were iterations of the loop, starting with 1, 1, 2, 16, and continuing with each subsequent element being 2 raised to the power of the corresponding index in `arr`, and the final element is `2^i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To break it down further:
- The variable `arr` contains a list of indices.
- `i` takes on the value of each index in `arr` during each iteration.
- `c` increments by 1 with each iteration and reaches `n + 2` after the loop completes.
- The list `ans` starts with the values 1, 1, 2, 16, and then continues with each element being `2^i` for each index `i` in `arr`.
- The loop breaks once `c` equals `n + 2`, which happens after the specified number of iterations.
