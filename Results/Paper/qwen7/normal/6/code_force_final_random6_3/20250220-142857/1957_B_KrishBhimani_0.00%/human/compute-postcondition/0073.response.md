Output State: **`arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 2, `c` is the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `k` is now `k >> 1**.

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, which divides the non-zero odd number by 2. Since `k0` is equal to `k`, `k0` also gets updated to the result of this operation. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
