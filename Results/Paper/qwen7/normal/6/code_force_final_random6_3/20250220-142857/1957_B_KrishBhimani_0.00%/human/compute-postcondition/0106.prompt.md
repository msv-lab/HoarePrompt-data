Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list containing all the indices where `i` was incremented and `k & 1 == 1` was true, `i` is the final value of `i` which is `k0 + 1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is 0, and `k0` is equal to the initial value of `k` before it became 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is `k0 + 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` contains the value `k0 - (sum(ans) + 1 << i)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is increased by 1, `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` now contains the new element which is `1 << i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` appended, `c` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
