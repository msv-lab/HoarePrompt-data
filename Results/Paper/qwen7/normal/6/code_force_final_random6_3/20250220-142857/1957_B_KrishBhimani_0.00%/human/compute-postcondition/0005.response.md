Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, or `k0`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `i` is updated to 0.
