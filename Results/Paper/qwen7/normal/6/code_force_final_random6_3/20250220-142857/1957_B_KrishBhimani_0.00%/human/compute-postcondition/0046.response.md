Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in arr`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `c` is equal to `n` + 1 (though `c` is not directly used in the loop).
   - `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the fourth element is `2^4`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is iterating over `arr`, the value of `i` will change in each iteration.
   - The list `arr` might change depending on what happens inside the loop, but since no changes to `arr` are mentioned, we assume it remains the same.
   - The variable `c` is not directly used in the loop, so its value does not affect the loop condition.
   - The variable `ans` is not directly used in the loop, so its value does not affect the loop condition.
   - The break condition is not relevant for adjusting the loop state.

Given that `i` is currently 4 and the loop is iterating over `arr`, for the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `arr`. Since `arr` contains at least one element and `i` was 4 in the previous iteration, the next element in `arr` must be the first element of `arr` (assuming `i` started from the first element).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` will be the first element of `arr`.
- `arr` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the exact value of the first element of `arr` is not specified, we can denote it as `first_element_of_arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the fourth element is `2^4`**
