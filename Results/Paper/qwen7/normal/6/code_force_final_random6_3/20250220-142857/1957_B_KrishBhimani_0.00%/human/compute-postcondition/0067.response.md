Output State: **`arr` is [0], `i` is 0, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 (using bitwise right shift), `k0` is equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`. This operation effectively divides `k` by 2. Since `k` is a non-zero odd number, after the division, `k` remains an integer but is now half of its original value. All other variables (`arr`, `i`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, and `k0`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
