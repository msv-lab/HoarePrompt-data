Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `k0` is the same as `k`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
