Output State: `c` is 12, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16, -5, 256, -27, 1024, -113, 4096].

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and its execution:

1. The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr` which contains [1, 4, 8].
2. For each iteration, it checks if `c` equals `n - 1` (which is 7 in this case). Since `c` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will continue until `c` reaches 10.
3. Inside the loop, it appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`, where `i` is the current element from `arr`.
4. After the loop, since `c` equals `n - 1`, it appends `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` to `ans` and then breaks out of the loop.

Given the initial conditions and the provided output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can deduce that the loop will fully execute when `c` reaches 10. After the fourth iteration, `c` will increment to 11, and the condition `c == n - 1` will no longer be met. Therefore, the loop will append the final value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` to `ans` and then terminate.

Since `k0` is 0 and `n` is 8, the final value appended to `ans` will be `-27` (calculated as `0 - (-11 + 16 - 5 + 256) + 1 * 8 = -27`) followed by `1024` (since `1 << 8` equals `256` but considering the sequence, it should be `1024`).

Thus, the final `ans` list will contain the values [-11, 16, -5, 256, -27, 1024, -113, 4096].
