Output State: **`arr` is a list containing [1, 4], `i` is 4, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer, and `k` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `arr`. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `k0`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` is still determined by the first element of `l1`, and `k` is still the second element of `l1`, with the conditions that `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-zero integer, and `k` is at least 2.
