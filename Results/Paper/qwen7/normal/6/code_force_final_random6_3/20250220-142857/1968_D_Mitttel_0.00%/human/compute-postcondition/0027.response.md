Output State: **`index` is 17 + 2 * n + n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)` and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` by converting the elements in the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers using `map(int, ...)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
