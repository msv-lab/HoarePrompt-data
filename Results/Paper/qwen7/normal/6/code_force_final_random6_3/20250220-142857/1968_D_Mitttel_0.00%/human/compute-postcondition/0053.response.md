Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads in values for \( n \), \( k \), \( PB \), \( PS \), a permutation \( p \), and an array \( a \). It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters to compute a result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each case.**
