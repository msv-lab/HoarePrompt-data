Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, and `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `PB = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `PB` by converting the element at index `index + 2` of the `data` list to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `PB`.
