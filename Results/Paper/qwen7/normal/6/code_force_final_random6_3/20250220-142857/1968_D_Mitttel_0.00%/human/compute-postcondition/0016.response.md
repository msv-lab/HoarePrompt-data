Output State: **`index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In this case, the code calls the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the return value of this function call. All other variables retain their initial states.
