You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will have advanced by the total amount required for all iterations, which is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n. The variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of iterations minus one (since it starts at the number of iterations and decreases by one each time). The `results` list will contain the return values from `func_1` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `PB`, `k`, and `PS` will be updated based on their positions in the `data` list after the last iteration, and `p` and `a` will be lists of integers derived from the `data` list as described.
```
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
