Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from index to index + n converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The new value of `index` is calculated as `17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n` (since `index` was initially `17 + 3 * n + 4 + n` and now it is increased by `n`).
