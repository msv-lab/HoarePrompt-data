Output State: `index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for all iterations, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from index to index + n converted to integers for the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `index` will be at the position right after the last set of data processed, specifically at `17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n`. The variable `t` will have been decremented by the total number of iterations (which is 3 in this case). The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1` for each iteration. The values of `PB`, `k`, and `PS` will be from the current positions in the `data` list, and `p` and `a` will be lists of integers derived from the last set of data processed within the loop.
