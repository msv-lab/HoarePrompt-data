Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new element `result`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
