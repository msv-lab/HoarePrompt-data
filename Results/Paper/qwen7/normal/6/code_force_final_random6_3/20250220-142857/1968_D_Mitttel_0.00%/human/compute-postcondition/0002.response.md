Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using spaces.**

The code simply initializes the variable `index` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
