Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(remainder_steps)`. The only variable directly controlled by this loop is `remainder_steps`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`
   - `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`
   - `cycle_pos` remains unchanged
   - `cycle_score` remains unchanged
   - `score` is `score + a[current_pos - 1]`
   - `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`
   - `steps` remains unchanged
   - `visited` dictionary remains unchanged
   - `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `remainder_steps` being greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be decremented by 1 (as it decreases by 1 with each iteration of the loop).

5. **Update the States**:
   - `full_cycles` remains unchanged
   - `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, but since `remainder_steps` is used in the loop, we can assume `remaining_steps` is effectively `remainder_steps` from the previous context.
   - `cycle_pos` remains unchanged
   - `cycle_score` remains unchanged
   - `score` remains unchanged
   - `current_pos` remains unchanged
   - `steps` remains unchanged
   - `visited` dictionary remains unchanged
   - `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1, so it must be `remainder_steps - 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1**.
