Output State: **`cycle_pos` is updated to the value of `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` is increased by `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, `score` remains the same, `current_pos` remains the same, `steps` remains equal to `k`, `visited` remains a dictionary containing all positions visited during the loop with their corresponding step numbers, and `cycle_length` must be greater than 0.**

This means that the `cycle_score` has been incremented by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]`, while all other variables (`cycle_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, and `cycle_length`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
