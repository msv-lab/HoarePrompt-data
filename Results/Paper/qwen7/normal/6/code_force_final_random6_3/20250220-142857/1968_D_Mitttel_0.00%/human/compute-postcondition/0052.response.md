Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), and p (a list of n integers representing the permutation) and a (a list of n integers representing the array a).**

This means the function `func_2` takes in several parameters including a number of test cases, two integers n and k with specific ranges, two more integers PB and PS also within certain limits, and two lists: one representing a permutation of n integers and another representing an array of n integers. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, so it might perform some operations or process the inputs without returning a value.
