Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function does not account for Sasha's possible moves correctly. The function only considers Bodya's moves and does not properly simulate Sasha's moves, which can significantly affect the outcome of the game.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Bodya's starting position (PB):** 3
- **Sasha's starting position (PS):** 2
- **Length of the permutation (n):** 4
- **Duration of the game (k):** 2

The permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`.

Let's manually calculate the scores for both players:

**Bodya's moves:**
1. Start at position 3, score = 0 + a[3] = 0 + 6 = 6
2. Move to position 2, score = 6 + a[2] = 6 + 2 = 8

**Sasha's moves:**
1. Start at position 2, score = 0 + a[2] = 0 + 2 = 2
2. Move to position 1, score = 2 + a[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

Final scores:
- Bodya: 8
- Sasha: 9

According to the manual calculation, Sasha wins the game. However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the scores and does not handle Sasha's moves properly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
