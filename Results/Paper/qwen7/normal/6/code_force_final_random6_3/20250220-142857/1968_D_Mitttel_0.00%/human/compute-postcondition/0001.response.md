Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using spaces.**

The code reads a line of input using the specified input method and splits it into a list of strings using spaces. The original values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` contains the split input.
