Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_`, but it doesn't matter what it is named since it's not used inside the loop. The key variables that can be adjusted are `t` and `results`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `index` is 13 + 2 * n
   - `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`
   - `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`
   - `k` is `int(data[4])`
   - `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`

3. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop condition is based on `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `results` is a list containing the result of a function call, it does not change within the loop unless explicitly modified.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `index` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `PB` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `PS` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `p` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `results` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`**
