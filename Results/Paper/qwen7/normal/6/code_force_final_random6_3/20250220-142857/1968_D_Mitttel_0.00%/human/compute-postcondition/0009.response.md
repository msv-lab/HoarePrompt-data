Output State: **`index` is 6, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`.**

Explanation: The code `PB = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `PB` by converting the element at index `index + 2` in the `data` list to an integer. Given that `index` is initially 4, `index + 2` equals 6. Therefore, `PB` is set to the integer value of `data[6]`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
