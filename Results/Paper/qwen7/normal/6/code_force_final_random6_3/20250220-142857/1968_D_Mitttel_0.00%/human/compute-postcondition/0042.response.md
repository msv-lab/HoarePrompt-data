Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new result, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from index to index + n converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, after appending `result`, `results` now contains both the original return value and the new `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
