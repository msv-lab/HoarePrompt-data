Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is `data[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value at `data[index]` and converts it to an integer, storing it in `n`. Given that `index` was initially 2, after executing the line of code, `index` is incremented by 1 (since list indexing in Python starts at 0), making `index` equal to 3. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `results` list remains empty as no operations were performed on it. The value of `n` is set to `data[2]`, which is converted to an integer.
