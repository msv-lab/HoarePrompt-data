Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + 2 * a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `score += a[current_pos - 1]` increments the `score` by the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`. Since `current_pos` was already updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` before this line, the value added to `score` is the value at the new position of `current_pos` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
