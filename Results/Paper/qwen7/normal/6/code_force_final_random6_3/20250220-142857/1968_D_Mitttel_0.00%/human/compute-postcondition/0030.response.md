Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new element `result`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)` and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`.**

This means that the `results` list now includes the previous return value of `func_1` and the new `result`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, with `index` calculated as `17 + 3 * n`, `PB` being an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` decreased by 1, `k` as `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` as an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` as a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, and `a` as a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
