Output State: **`index` is 13 + n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a list `p` by converting the elements from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]` into integers using the `map` function. The value of `index` is updated to `index + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
