Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**

In this output state, the `score` variable is updated by adding `full_cycles * cycle_score` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
