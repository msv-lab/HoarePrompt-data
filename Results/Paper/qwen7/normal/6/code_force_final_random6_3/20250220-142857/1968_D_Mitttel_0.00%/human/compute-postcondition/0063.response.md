Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**

The code calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length` and assigns it to `remainder_steps`. The other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, and the `visited` dictionary) remain unchanged from their initial states.
