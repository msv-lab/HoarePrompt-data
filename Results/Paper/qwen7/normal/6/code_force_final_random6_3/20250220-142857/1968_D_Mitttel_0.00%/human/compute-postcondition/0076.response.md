Postcondition: **`score` is the sum of elements in the list `a` from index `start_pos - 1` to `end_pos - 1` (inclusive), `current_pos` is the position after the last jump, `steps` is equal to `k`, `visited` is a dictionary containing all positions visited during the loop with their corresponding step numbers, and `cycle_start` is -1 if no cycle was detected or the step number where the cycle started if a cycle was detected. If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start != -1`), `full_cycles` remains the same, `remaining_steps` is reduced by the number of steps executed within the loop, `score` is incremented by the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each step within the loop, `current_pos` is updated multiple times according to the rule `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration of the loop, and all other variables (`cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `steps`, `visited`) remain unchanged. If no cycle is detected, all variables remain as they were at the start of the loop.**
