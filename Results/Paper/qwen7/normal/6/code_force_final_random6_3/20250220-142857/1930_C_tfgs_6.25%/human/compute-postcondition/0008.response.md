Output State: The value of `i` is 9999; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` for `0 ≤ i < n` equals `i + 1`.

Explanation: Given the loop runs for `n` iterations (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \times 10^5`), after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`, which is `9999` in the maximum case. Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be equal to `i + 1` because the loop increments `a[i]` by `i + 1` during each iteration.
