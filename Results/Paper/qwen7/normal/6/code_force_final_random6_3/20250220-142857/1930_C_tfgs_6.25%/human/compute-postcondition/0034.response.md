Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `adv - 1`
- `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`
- `ans` contains the values `a[n-2] - 2`, `a[n-2] - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`
- `cnt` is `cnt - adv`
- `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i > 0`
- `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(adv):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `adv - 1`.

### Adjusting States
We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the initial state of the variables in the loop head. Specifically, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `j`.

- **`i`**: The value of `i` is `n`, but the loop variable `j` is not directly dependent on `i`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- **`j`**: The loop variable `j` starts at `adv - 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `adv`. Since `j` starts at `adv - 1`, it will execute exactly once when `j` is `0`.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure it starts at the correct value.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `0`**

This ensures that the loop will execute once as `j` starts at `0` and increments to `adv - 1` over the course of the loop.
