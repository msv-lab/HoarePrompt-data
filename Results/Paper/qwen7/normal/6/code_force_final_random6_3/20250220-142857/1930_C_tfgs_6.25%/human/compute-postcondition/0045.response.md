Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, `a[n-1] - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - 3`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` - 1, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, so `a[i]` is `a[n-1]`. Therefore, `ans` now includes `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, and `a[n-1]` (since `a[n-1]` is appended). The values of `i`, `j`, `cnt`, `counter[a[i - 1]]`, and `counter[a[i]]` are updated accordingly.
