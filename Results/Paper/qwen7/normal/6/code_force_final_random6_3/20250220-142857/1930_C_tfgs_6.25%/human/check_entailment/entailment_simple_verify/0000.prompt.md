You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be `n-1`; `a` will be a list where each element `a[i]` equals `1 + (i + 1)` for `0 ≤ i < n`. This means `a` will contain the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be equal to `1 + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `i + 2`. Therefore, the list `a` will contain the sequence starting from `1` up to `n`, i.e., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have been decremented below 0, as it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration. The variable `adv` will eventually become 0 because it is calculated as the minimum of three values, and as `i` reaches 0, the condition `i > 0` will no longer be met, preventing any further decrementing of `cnt` or updating of `counter`. The list `ans` will contain all elements from `a` in descending order, as each element of `a` is appended to `ans` exactly once during its respective iteration. Both `cnt` and `counter` will be 0 and empty, respectively, as they are continuously decremented and updated until their values reach 0 or there are no more elements to process.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order with each element decremented by the number of times it has been processed, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [elements of ans] (where ans is a list of elements from a in descending order, each decremented by the number of times it has been processed)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements in the array `a` are equal. According to the problem description, the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and inserting an element that is already present in the set should not change the set. However, the program uses `Counter` and `set` to ensure uniqueness, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the same value is inserted multiple times due to different indices.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```

The correct output should be `[3, 2, 1]` because:
- First operation: Select `i=1`, insert `a_1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, delete `a_1`.
- Second operation: Select `i=2`, insert `a_2 + 2 = 3` into `S`, delete `a_2`.
- Third operation: Select `i=3`, insert `a_3 + 3 = 4` into `S`, delete `a_3`.

Thus, `S = {4, 3, 2}` and sorting in descending order gives `[4, 3, 2]`.

However, the program outputs `[4, 3, 1]` because it incorrectly handles the insertion of the same value multiple times. Specifically, when it encounters the same value multiple times, it does not ensure that the set `S` remains unique as required by the problem description. This leads to the incorrect output.
