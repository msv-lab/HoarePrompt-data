Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `adv-1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `ans` contains the values `a[n-2] - 2`, `a[n-2] - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i > 0`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `adv` is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. This impacts the value of `adv` and updates the `counter` dictionary accordingly if `i > 0`. The other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
