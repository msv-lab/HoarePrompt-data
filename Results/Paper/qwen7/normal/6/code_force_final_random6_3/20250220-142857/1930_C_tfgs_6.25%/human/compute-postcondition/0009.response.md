Output State: The variable `i` will be `n-1`; `a` will be a list where each element `a[i]` equals `1 + (i + 1)` for `0 â‰¤ i < n`. This means `a` will contain the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be equal to `1 + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `i + 2`. Therefore, the list `a` will contain the sequence starting from `1` up to `n`, i.e., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
