Output State: `i` is `n`, `j` is `adv`, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, ..., `a[n-1] - (adv - 1)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the value `a[n-1] - j - 1` to the list `ans` for each iteration where `j` ranges from `0` to `adv - 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times as per the provided states, it implies that `adv` is 3. Therefore, after all iterations, `ans` will contain the elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, and `a[n-1] - 3`. The variable `i` remains `n` and `j` becomes `adv` (which is 3) after the loop completes.
