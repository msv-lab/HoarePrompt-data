Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves manipulating an array `a` by inserting modified values into a set `S` and then sorting `S` in descending order to form array `b`. The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`, we need to ensure that the largest possible values are inserted into `S` first.
   - By incrementing each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`, we ensure that the largest possible values are generated early in the process.
   - The code correctly handles the insertion of these incremented values into a set, ensuring uniqueness.
   - The sorting and construction of the final list `ans` follow the logic of constructing `b` in descending order.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly processes each test case as specified.
   - It first increments each element in `a` by its index plus one.
   - It then uses a `Counter` to count occurrences and ensures uniqueness by converting `a` to a set.
   - The list `a` is sorted in descending order.
   - The main loop constructs `ans` by appending elements from the sorted unique list and decrementing counts appropriately.
   - Any remaining decrements are handled by appending the last element of `ans` decremented by the required amount.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the number of elements in `a` is small or when there are duplicate values.
   - The logic ensures that the largest possible values are prioritized, which aligns with the requirement to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **True**
