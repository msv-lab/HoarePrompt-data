Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `adv-1`, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains the values `a[n-2] - 2`, `a[n-2] - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The variable `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decremented by the value of `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
