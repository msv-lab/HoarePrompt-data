Output State: `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values entered as input over the course of the loop's iterations, `u` is the second integer input from the split when `i` was `m-2`, `v` is the third integer input from the split when `i` was `m-2`, `f` is the fourth integer input from the split when `i` was `m-2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `m`, meaning it has incremented once for each iteration of the loop. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input during the loop's execution. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` will contain the last set of values read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
