Output State: **`i` is `k`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is increased by `f`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is incremented by the value of `f`. The values of `i`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state.
