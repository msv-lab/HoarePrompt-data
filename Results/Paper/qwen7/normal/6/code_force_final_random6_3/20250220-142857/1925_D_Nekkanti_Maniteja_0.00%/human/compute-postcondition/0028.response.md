Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is `k * (c * k * c * m + c * a)`, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code initializes the constant `M` to the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This value does not affect the existing variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The new constant `M` is introduced with its specific value.
