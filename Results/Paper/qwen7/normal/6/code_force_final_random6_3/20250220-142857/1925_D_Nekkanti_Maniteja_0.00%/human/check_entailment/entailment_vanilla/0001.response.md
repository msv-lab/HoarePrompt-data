Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Constants and Variables Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used as the modulus.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is intended to be the reciprocal of the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of all initial friendship values.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program iterates through all `m` pairs of friends.
   - It reads the indices `u` and `v` of the pair and their friendship value `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating the Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
   - It then enters a loop for `k` excursions.
   - In each excursion, it updates `s` using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected increase in friendship values.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\). However, this calculation is incorrect because \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) might not be an integer, and even if it is, the inverse should be calculated properly considering the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value**:
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of increasing the friendship value after each pick.

3. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation**:
   - The modular multiplicative inverse should be calculated correctly using an appropriate method such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
