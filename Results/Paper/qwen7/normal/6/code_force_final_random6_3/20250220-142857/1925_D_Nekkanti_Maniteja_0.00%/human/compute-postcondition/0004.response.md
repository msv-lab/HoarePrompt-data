Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all these variables with their respective values or descriptions.
