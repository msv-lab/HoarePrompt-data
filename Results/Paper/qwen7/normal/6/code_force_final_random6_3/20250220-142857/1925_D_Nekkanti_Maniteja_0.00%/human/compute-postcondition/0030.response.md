Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `c` is `(n * (n - 1) // 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `s = 0` sets the variable `s` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `c`. The value of `c` is still calculated as `(n * (n - 1) // 1)`, which was determined before the execution of the line `s = 0`.
