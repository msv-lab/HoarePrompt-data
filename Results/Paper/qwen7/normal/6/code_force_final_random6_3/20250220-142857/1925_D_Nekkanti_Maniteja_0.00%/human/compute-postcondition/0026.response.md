Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `k-1`
   - `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0
   - `s` is `k * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of `int(input())`.
   - The value of `i` in each iteration is determined by the input from the user.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `k`.
   - The new value of `i` is `k`, and the loop will check if `k` is within the range defined by `int(input())`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be updated to `k`.
   - Since the loop is dependent on the input from the user, the value of `k` will be updated based on the user's input.
   - The values of `k`, `c`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - The value of `s` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `k` (the next value after `k-1`).
   - `k` remains the same as it is the result of the user's input.
   - `s` will be recalculated as `k * (c * k * c * m + c * a)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is `k * (c * k * c * m + c * a)**
