Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). However, the formula used to calculate `c` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \).

2. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse**: The code calculates the modular inverse using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, but this is incorrect because it uses integer division `//` which truncates the result. This should be replaced with floating-point division `/`.

3. **Incorrect Summation Logic**: The summation logic in the loop is incorrect. The expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.

4. **Missing Handling of Friendships**: The program does not handle the fact that friendships can increase over time. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends and then summing these expectations.

### Correct Solution Outline:
1. Calculate the total number of possible pairs.
2. Calculate the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs.
3. For each pair of friends, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
4. Sum these expected values to get the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def mod_inverse(x, mod):
    return pow(x, -1, mod)

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = mod_inverse(total_pairs, M)
        s = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected value for each pair of friends
            s += f * (1 - (1 - 1 / total_pairs) ** k) / (1 / total_pairs)
        
        print(int(s % M))

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the expected value calculations and modular arithmetic.
