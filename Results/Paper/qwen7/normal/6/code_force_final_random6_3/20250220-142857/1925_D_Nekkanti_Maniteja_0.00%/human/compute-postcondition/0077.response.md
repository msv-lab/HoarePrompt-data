Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is \( s \) equals \( c \times \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \times c \times m + k \times c \times a \). Here, \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), \( a \) is the total sum of all \( f_i \) values provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, \( k \) is the number of iterations the outer loop runs, and \( m \) is the number of edges in the graph.
