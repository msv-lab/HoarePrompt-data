Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` plus `f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
