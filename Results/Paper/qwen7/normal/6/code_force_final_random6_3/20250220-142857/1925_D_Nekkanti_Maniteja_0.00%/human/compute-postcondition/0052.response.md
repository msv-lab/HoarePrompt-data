Output State: **`s` is `c * (k + m - 1) * c * m * m + c * a * m`, `i` is `k + m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still calculated as `c * (k + m - 1) * c * m * m + c * a * m`, `i` is still `k + m`, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers.
