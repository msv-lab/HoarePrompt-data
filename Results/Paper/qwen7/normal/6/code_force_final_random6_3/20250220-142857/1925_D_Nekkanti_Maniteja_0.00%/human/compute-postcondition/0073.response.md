Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `c` is \(n \cdot (n - 1)\), `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input, `s` is `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + 2 * c * a**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to the current value of `s`. Here, `i` is `i_prev + 3`, and `c` remains `n * (n - 1)`. The values of `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged. The updated value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus `c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a`, which simplifies to `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + 2 * c * a`.
