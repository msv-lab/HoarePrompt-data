Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is not relevant to the expected value calculation. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values.

2. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse**: The variable `c` is used incorrectly in the summation, leading to an incorrect result. The expected value should be calculated using the probabilities of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship values.

3. **Lack of Probability Consideration**: The program does not consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends. For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), but the program does not incorporate this into the expected value calculation.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected value for each pair of friends and summing these expectations. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Possible Pairs**: This is \( \binom{n}{2} \).
2. **Calculate the Expected Increase in Friendship Values**: For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
3. **Sum the Expected Values**: Sum the expected increases for all pairs of friends.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program does not correctly implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
