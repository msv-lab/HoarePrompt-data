Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `k + 2`, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers obtained from the input split operation.
