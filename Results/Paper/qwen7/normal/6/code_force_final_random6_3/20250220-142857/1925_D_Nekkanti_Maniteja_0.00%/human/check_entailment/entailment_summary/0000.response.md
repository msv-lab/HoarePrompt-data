Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically:
   - The program incorrectly uses the modular inverse of \( n \times (n-1) \) without considering the actual problem requirements.
   - The program does not properly account for the probability of choosing a friend pair versus a non-friend pair.
   - The formula used in the program does not match the expected value calculation for the given problem.
3. The program should calculate the expected value based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and how the friendship value changes over excursions.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
