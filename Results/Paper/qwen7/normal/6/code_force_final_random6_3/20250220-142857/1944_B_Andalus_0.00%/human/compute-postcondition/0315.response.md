Output State: **`ldb` contains the value of `lft[i]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `lft[i]` is equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the list `ldb` has been updated to include the value of `lft[i]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition that `lft[i]` is equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]` is still valid.
