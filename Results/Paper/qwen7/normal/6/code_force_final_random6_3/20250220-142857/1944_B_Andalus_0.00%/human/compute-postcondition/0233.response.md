Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, the size of `sng` (denoted as sz) is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sng` or `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the conditions and sizes of `sng` remain unchanged, and the break statement is noted.
