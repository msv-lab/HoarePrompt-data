Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` is a non-empty list.
   - `ldb` remains unchanged.
   - `sz` is equal to the original size of `sng` plus 1.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `sng`.
   - `elem` takes the value of each element in `sng` during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `sng` is a list, and the loop iterates over its elements, after the first iteration, `sng` will have one less element.
   - `ldb` remains unchanged.
   - `sz` should now be equal to the original size of `sng` (which was `sz - 1`).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `sng` will have one less element, but it will still be a non-empty list.
   - `ldb` remains unchanged.
   - `sz` will be the original size of `sng` minus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`sng` is a non-empty list, `ldb` remains unchanged, and `sz` is equal to the original size of `sng` minus 1**.
