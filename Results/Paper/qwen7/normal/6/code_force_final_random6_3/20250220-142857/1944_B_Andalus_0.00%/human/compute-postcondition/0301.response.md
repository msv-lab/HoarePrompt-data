Output State: All elements in `sng` have been printed, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`, and `rdb` is an iterable containing all the elements from `sng`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `sz` will be equal to the length of `sng` because the loop increments `sz` for each element in `sng` until it either reaches `k` or processes all elements. Since the loop breaks when `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and assuming `k` is not larger than the length of `sng`, all elements of `sng` will be printed. The variable `rdb` will contain all the elements from `sng` as it accumulates them during each iteration.
