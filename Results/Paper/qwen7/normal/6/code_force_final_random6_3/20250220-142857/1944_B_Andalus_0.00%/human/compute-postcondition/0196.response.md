Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]` appended, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if the loop is to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `rdb` will now contain the value of `rgt[i]` appended (since `i` is now `i + 1`), and `rgt[i]` will be equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.

Given the above points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `rdb` will contain the value of `rgt[i]` appended.
- `rgt[i]` will be equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `i` and `n` from the given information, we'll express the state in terms of these variables.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`**, where `i` is `i + 1`.
