Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a non-empty list, but no specific elements or length of `sng` are mentioned. Additionally, `ldb` remains unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem`. However, since `elem` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that `elem` refers to an element from the list `sng`.

Since `sng` is non-empty and the size of `sng` is not specified, we can only say that `elem` is one of the elements in `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the non-empty list sng)**
