Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 2.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it 2. The state of `rdb` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty iterable. The condition that the difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 2 also holds true since initially, the difference was at least 2, and now `sz` is 2.
