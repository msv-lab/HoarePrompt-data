Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty sequence.
- `sz` is `k` + 1.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. Since `elem` is not further specified, we cannot determine its exact value.

Output: **elem**
