Output State: **`rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to `rdb`. Since `rgt[i]` was previously equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, appending this value to `rdb` does not change the relationship between `rgt[i]` and `rgt[i - 1]`. Therefore, `rdb` now includes the latest value of `rgt[i]`, and `rgt[i]` remains equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.
