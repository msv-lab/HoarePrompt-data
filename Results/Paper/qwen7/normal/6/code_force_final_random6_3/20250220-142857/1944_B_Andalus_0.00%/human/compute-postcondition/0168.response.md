Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`, and the left value at index `i` (`lft[i]`) is not equal to the left value at index `i - 1` (`lft[i - 1]`). Additionally, `i` is less than `n - 1` and the left value at index `i` (`lft[i]`) is not equal to the left value at index `i + 1` (`lft[i + 1]`); `sng` is a list with the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 1, the condition checks are satisfied (as per the initial state), and `lft[i]` is appended to `sng`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
