Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` is a list with an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it. `sng` is updated as follows: if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, then the `sng` list has appended the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `ldb` and `sng` are updated as per the previous iteration.
