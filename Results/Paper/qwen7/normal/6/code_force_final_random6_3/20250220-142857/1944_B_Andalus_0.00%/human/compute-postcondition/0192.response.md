Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.
   - `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended.

4. **Determine the values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since the loop just finished its previous iteration, `i` must be `n-1` (the highest value it could have reached before the current iteration).
   - Therefore, `rgt[n-1]` is equal to `rgt[n-2]`.
   - `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[n-1]` appended.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Hence, `i` should be `n` (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time).
   - The postcondition remains the same: `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is now `n`, `rgt[i]` (which is `rgt[n]`) should be equal to `rgt[n-1]`.
   - `rdb` should contain the value of `rgt[n]` appended.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` where `i` is `n`, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended.**
