Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration), the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sng`, `elem`, or `sz`. It only indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
