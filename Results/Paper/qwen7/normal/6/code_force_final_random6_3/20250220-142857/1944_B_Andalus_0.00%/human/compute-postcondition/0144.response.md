Based on the initial state provided, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, and `sz` (the length of `sng`) is equal to `k`. The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly given in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined in the provided information, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include the placeholder `elem`.

Output: **elem**
