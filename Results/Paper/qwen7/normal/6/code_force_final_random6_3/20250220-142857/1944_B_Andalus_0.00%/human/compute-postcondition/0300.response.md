Output State: **`sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must contain at least one element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. The conditions related to `sng` and the loop or if statement remain unchanged. Therefore, `sng` must still contain at least one element, and if `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `sz` is still less than `k`, no additional action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.
