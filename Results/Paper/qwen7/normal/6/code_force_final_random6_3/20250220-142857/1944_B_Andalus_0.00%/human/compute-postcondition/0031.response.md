Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` is a list with an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `ldb` is updated by adding the element `lft[i]` to it.
