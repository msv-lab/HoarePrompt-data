Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `lft` starting from the second element, and `sng` will contain all unique elements from `lft` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates.**

This means that after the loop completes its execution, `i` will have reached the value of `n` (since the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`). The list `ldb` will collect all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of their immediate predecessor, starting from the second element of `lft`. Similarly, the list `sng` will collect all elements from `lft` that are not duplicates of their immediate predecessor, ensuring that no consecutive duplicates are present in `sng`.
