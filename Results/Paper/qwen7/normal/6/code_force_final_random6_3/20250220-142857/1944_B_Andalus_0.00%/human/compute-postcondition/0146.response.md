Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `sng` is a non-empty sequence.
   - `sz` is `k` + 1.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `sng` is not empty.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still be a non-empty sequence. Since the loop breaks when `sng` becomes empty, we need to ensure `sng` remains non-empty for the next iteration.

5. **Maintaining Other States**: The state of `sz` (which is `k` + 1) and the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `sng` to ensure it remains a non-empty sequence.

**Final State**:
State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
