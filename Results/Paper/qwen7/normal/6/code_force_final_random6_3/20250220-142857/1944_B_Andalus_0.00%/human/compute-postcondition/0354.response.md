Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in ldb:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `ldb`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`.

3. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `i` will be `n`, and `n` remains unchanged.
   - `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ldb`, the variable `ldb` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `elem` will take on the value of each element in `ldb` during each iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ldb` is a non-empty list for the loop to execute. The other variables (`sz`, `i`, `n`, `rdb`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`ldb` is a non-empty list**.
