Based on the initial state provided:

- `elem` is the first element of `ldb`.
- `i` is 0.
- `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since `elem` is explicitly defined as the first element of `ldb`, we can directly use this information.

Output: **elem elem**
