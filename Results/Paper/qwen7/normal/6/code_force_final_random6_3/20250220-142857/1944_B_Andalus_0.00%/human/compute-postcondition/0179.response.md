Output State: **`i` is 3; `ldb` has the element `lft[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 3, `ldb` will have its element updated to include `lft[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` is an integer greater than 1 is still valid but not directly affected by this line of code.
