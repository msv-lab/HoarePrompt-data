Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1. Given that `sz` was initially equal to `k`, after executing `sz += 1`, `sz` becomes `k + 1`. The conditions and postconditions related to `sng` remain unchanged, and since the code does not specify an else part, the break condition also remains valid.
