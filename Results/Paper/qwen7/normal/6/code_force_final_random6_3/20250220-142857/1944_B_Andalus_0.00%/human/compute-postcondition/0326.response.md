Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i_end + 1` and less than `n`, `sng` has appended `lft[i]` to its list.**

Explanation: The code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must still be `i_end + 1` and less than `n`. Additionally, the list `sng` now includes the value of `lft[i]`.
