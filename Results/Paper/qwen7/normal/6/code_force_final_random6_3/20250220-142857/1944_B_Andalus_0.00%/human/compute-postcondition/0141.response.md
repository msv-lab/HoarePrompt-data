Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, and the length of `sng` (or `sz`) is equal to `k', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `sng` and `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the length of `sng` remains `k`, and `sng` itself remains a non-empty sequence.
