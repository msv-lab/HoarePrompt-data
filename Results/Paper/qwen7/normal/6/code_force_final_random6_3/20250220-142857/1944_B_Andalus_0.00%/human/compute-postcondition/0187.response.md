Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and runs up to `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 1, and `n` should be a positive integer greater than 1 to ensure the loop can run at least once.
3. **Understand the Purpose of the Loop**: The loop iterates through the list `lft` starting from index 1. It checks if the current element is equal to the previous element (`lft[i-1]`) and if it is not equal to the next element (`lft[i+1]`). Based on these conditions, it populates the lists `ldb` and `sng`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the initial state of `i` and `n` allows the loop to execute correctly. Specifically:
- `i` should be initialized to 1.
- `n` should be a positive integer greater than 1 to ensure the loop can run at least once.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
