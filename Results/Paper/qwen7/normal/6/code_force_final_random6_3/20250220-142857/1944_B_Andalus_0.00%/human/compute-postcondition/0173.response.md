Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`, `sng` has an element appended which is `lft[2]`**

Explanation: The code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[2]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is initially 2, the value at index 2 of the list `lft` is appended to `sng`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
