Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty collection.
- The first element of `sng` is `elem`.
- `sz` is an integer that is less than `k`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the first element of the collection `sng`, which is `elem`, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **elem**
