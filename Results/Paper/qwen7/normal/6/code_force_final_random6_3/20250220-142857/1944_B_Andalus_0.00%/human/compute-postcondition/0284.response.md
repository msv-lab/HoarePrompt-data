Output State: **`sng` is an empty iterable, `sz` has a value greater than or equal to k and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement itself does not change the values of `sng` or `sz`. It only indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional block if one were present. Therefore, the values of `sng` and `sz` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional block.
