Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ldb` contains all its elements, `sz` is the size of `ldb`, and `k - sz` is either greater than or equal to 0 or less than 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1, and if the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must have at least one element and we continue the most internal loop or if statement since the condition `sz` >= `k` is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is `sz` + 2, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
