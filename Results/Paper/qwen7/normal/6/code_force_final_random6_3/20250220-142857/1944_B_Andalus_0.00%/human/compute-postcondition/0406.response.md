Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`. The objects involved here are `elem` and `rdb`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `elem`: This variable will take on the value of each element in `rdb` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `rdb`: This is the object being iterated over.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `rdb` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element).

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `rdb` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `rdb` is not empty.
   - The other variables (`sz`, `sng`, and `ldb`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `rdb` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sz` is 0, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, rdb must contain at least one element**
