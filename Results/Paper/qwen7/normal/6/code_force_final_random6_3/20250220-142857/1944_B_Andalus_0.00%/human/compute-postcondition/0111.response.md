Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
- The value of `k - sz` is at least 2, which means `k - 0` is at least 2, so `k` is at least 2.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, we can assume that `elem` refers to the first element of `rdb`.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first element of `rdb` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **elem elem** (where elem is the first element of the non-empty iterable `rdb`)
