Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements found in `rgt` starting from index 1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will run from `1` to `n-1`. The loop checks if the current element `rgt[i]` is equal to the previous element `rgt[i-1]`. If they are equal, the current element `rgt[i]` is appended to the list `rdb`. This process continues until the loop finishes, resulting in `rdb` containing all consecutive duplicate elements starting from index 1. The state of other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
