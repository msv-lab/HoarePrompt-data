Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is the size of `ldb` plus 2.
- `k - sz` is either greater than or equal to 0 or less than 0. This means `k - sz` could be any integer, but it doesn't affect the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is a variable that is part of the `ldb` list. Since `ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` must be one of the elements in `ldb`.

Given this information, the print statement will output two identical elements from the `ldb` list, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
