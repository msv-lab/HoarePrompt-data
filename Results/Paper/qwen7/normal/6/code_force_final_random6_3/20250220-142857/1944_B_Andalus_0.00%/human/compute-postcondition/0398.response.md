Postcondition: `sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and either the size of `sng` (`sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part specified, so the collection remains unchanged with the first element being `elem`.
