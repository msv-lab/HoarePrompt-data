Output State: **The loop continues executing as long as `sz` is less than `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` if `sz` was able to reach `k` during the loop's execution. If `sz` could not reach `k` because `k - sz` was less than 2 for all elements in `ldb`, then `sz` will remain the last value it reached which is less than `k`. The value of `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` as per the initial conditions.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `sz` will either be equal to `k` if the condition `k - sz >= 2` was met for at least one element in `ldb` enough times to reach `k`, or it will be the largest value less than `k` that satisfies the condition. The list `ldb` itself does not change, and `rdb` retains its initial state containing all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.
