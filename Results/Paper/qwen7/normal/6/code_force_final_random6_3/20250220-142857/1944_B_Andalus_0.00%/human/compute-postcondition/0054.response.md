Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over the elements of `ldb`.
   - The loop variable used in the iteration is `elem`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `elem`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ldb`, the initial value of `elem` is the first element of `ldb`.

3. **Understand the Final State Conditions:**
   - After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element.
   - There are no specific requirements for the contents of `sng`.
   - `sz` is 0.

4. **Analyze the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that each iteration processes one element from `ldb`.
   - The final state of `i` being equal to `n` suggests that the loop runs `n` times.
   - The final state of `rdb` containing consecutive duplicates from `rgt` implies that the loop body must check for consecutive duplicates in `rgt`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `ldb`, the initial state of `elem` should be the first element of `ldb`.
   - The loop runs `n` times, so `i` should start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
   - The contents of `rdb` depend on the loop body, but we don't need to specify them here since they are derived from the loop processing `rgt`.
   - `sz` is already given as 0, so no adjustment is needed for this.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `elem` should be the first element of `ldb`.
- `i` should be 0 (initial state) and will be incremented in the loop until it reaches `n-1`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`elem` is the first element of `ldb`, `i` is 0**
