Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print two instances of `elem` followed by a space. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it is part of the iterable `rdb`.

Output: **elem elem**
