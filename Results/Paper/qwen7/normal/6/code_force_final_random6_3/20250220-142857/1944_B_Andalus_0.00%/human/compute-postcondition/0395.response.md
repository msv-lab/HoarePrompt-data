Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration), the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is `sz + 1`; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, while the collections `sng` and its first element `elem` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement based on the value of `sz` relative to `k` also remains the same.
