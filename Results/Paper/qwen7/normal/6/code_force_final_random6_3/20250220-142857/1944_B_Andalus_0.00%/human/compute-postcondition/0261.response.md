Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding `elem`:**
   - The variable `elem` is not defined in the given initial state. There is no explicit value provided for `elem`.
   - Since `elem` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information.

2. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement prints `elem` twice, separated by a space, and then uses `end=' '` to ensure that the next line starts immediately after the printed text without a newline.

Given these points, the output will depend on the value of `elem`. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem**
