Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` must have at least one element.
- `sz` is `sz` + 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- There is no else part, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.

Since the precondition does not specify the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe it in terms of its current state. Given that `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first (or any subsequent) element of `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of sng)**
