Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
   - `n` is the number of elements in `sng`.
   - `rdb` is an empty list.
   - `sz` is set to 2.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Identifying `elem`**:
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in `sng`. Since `sng` is not explicitly defined with its contents, we need to consider the context of the problem. Given that `elem` is the second element, it means `sng` must have at least two elements. Let's denote the elements of `sng` as `[sng[0], sng[1], ..., sng[n-1]]`. Therefore, `elem = sng[1]`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.
   - This will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '` ensures there is no newline).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and without the explicit content of `sng`, we can only describe it as `sng[1]`.

Output: **sng[1]**
