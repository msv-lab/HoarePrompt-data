Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` holds true; additionally, after executing the if-else block, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, the variable `sng` contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it. If the condition `i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is not met, `sng` remains unchanged.
