Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is a sublist of `lst` containing the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `lst`. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `lst`) remain unchanged.
