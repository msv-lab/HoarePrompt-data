Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and if `lft[3]` equals `lft[2]`, then `ldb` has the element `lft[3]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[3]` does not equal `lft[4]`, then `sng` has appended the value of `lft[3]`. If neither condition is met, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged.
