Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer.
- `sng` is a list, and its first element has been printed 0 times.
- `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not mentioned to be any specific value or derived from other variables, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, we need to consider the context and typical usage of such a print statement.

Given that `sng` has its first element printed 0 times, it implies that `elem` might be referring to the first element of `sng`. However, since it has been printed 0 times, it suggests that `elem` is not yet assigned a value from `sng`.

Since no value is provided for `elem`, and we cannot infer a value based on the given information, the most precise answer would be that `elem` is an undefined or unspecified value.

Output: **elem elem**
