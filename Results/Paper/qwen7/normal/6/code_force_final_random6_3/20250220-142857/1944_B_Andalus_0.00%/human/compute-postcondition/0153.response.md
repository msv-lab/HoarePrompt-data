Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `sng` is a non-empty sequence.
   - `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(T):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs `T` times.
   - The loop body is not provided, but we know it must modify `sng` and `sz` in some way.
   - The loop breaks when `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop runs `T` times, at the start of each iteration, `T` is decremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `T` is greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `T` must have been greater than 0, and now it should be decremented by 1.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `sng` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `sz` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `T` is decremented by 1.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `T` is decremented by 1.
- `sng` remains a non-empty sequence (no additional information about `sng` is given).
- `sz` remains `k` + `len(sng)` (no additional information about `sz` is given).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`**.
