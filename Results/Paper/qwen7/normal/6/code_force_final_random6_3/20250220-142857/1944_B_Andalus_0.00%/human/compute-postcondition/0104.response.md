State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for elem in rdb:` iterates over each element in the iterable `rdb`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `rdb` must contain at least one element.
3. The variable `sz` (which is currently 0) does not affect whether the loop can execute or not, as the loop's condition is based on the contents of `rdb`, not `sz`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `rdb` must be a non-empty iterable.
