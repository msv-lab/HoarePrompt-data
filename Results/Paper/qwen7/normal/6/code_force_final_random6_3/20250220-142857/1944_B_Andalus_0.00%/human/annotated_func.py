#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged, `rdb` contains all unique elements from `sng` that were printed during the loop, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it identifies and prints pairs of identical elements from the first half of the list, followed by single occurrences of elements from both halves of the list, ensuring that the total number of printed elements does not exceed k. The function then prints a newline after processing each test case.
