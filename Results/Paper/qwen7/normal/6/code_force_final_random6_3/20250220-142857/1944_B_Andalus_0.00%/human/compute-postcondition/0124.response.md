Output State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz` and `rdb`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `sz` (which is either 2 or 4) and `rdb` (a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before) remain unchanged.
