Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2, `elem` is the third element of `ldb`, `i` is 1, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `sz` is increased by 2, while the other variables (`elem`, `i`, and the condition related to `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
