Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `sz` is an integer.
- `sng` is a list with its first element having been printed 0 times, implying that the first element of `sng` has not yet been printed.
- `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

However, there is no variable or object named `elem` mentioned in the initial state. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that `elem` refers to the first element of `sng` since that is the only list mentioned and its first element has not been printed yet.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first element of `sng` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[first element of sng] [first element of sng]**
