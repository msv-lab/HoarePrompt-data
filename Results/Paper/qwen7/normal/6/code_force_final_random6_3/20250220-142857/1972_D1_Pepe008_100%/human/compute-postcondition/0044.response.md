Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be a positive integer, `x` is 1, `suma` is 1**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` (which is 1) to `suma`. Since `suma` was initially 0 (implied by the initial state), after adding 1, `suma` becomes 1. The values of `i`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
