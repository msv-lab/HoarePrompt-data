Postcondition: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is a positive integer, `suma` is `x + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`, and the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is such that `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0)` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`.

This means that if the condition `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0)` is true, then `suma` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if-else block.
