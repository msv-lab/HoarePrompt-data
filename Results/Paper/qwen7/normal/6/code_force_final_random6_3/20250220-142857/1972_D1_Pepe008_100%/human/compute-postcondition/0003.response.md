Output State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, and `b` is an integer equal to the second element of `info`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first and second elements of the list `info` to variables `a` and `b`, respectively, converting them to integers using `int()`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The list `info` is not modified; it is just referenced.
