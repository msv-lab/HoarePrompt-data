Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is an integer value from `info[0]`, `b` must be a positive integer, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` was initially set to 1, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 2. Substituting `i = 2` into the formula gives us `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
