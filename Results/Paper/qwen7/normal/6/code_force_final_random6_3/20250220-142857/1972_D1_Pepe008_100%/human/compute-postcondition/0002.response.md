Output State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, `t` is 0 and `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
