Output State: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is the maximum value it took during the loop's execution, `suma` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the loop's conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is the last value of `x` calculated within the loop, which is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1`, if `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not incremented.

After the loop completes all its iterations, `t` retains the initial value of `T`, and `info` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `b` takes its maximum value from all iterations of the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the sum of `x` values where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and adds an extra `1` if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true. The variable `i` increments from `1` to `b + 1`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each iteration, with the final value of `x` being the last computed value before the loop ends.
