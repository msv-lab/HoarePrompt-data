Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `1` to `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b + 1`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to `3` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `b + 1`.

Given the conditions:
- `i` is currently `2`.
- `i` needs to be incremented to `3`.
- The loop will continue if `3 <= b + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `t` is `T`
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- The first element of `info` is an integer `a`
- `b` must be at least `2` (since `i` is now `3` and `i` must be less than or equal to `b + 1`)
- `suma` is either `x + 1` or remains `0`
- `i` is `3`
- `x` is `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`
- The current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` must satisfy the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i`

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 2, `suma` is either `x + 1` or remains `0`, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`, and the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` satisfies the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i`**
