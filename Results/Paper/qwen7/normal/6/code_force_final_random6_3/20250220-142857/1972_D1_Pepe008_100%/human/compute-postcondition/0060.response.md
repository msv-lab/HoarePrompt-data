Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `x` is 7, and `suma` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to:

\[
x = (a - 3 \times (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1 = (a - 6) // 9 + 1
\]

Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `x` is updated to `7`. The other variables remain unchanged.
