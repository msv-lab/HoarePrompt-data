Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` takes a single line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `info` are replaced with this new list. No other variables are affected, so the precondition remains unchanged for them.
