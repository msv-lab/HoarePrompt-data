You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    #State: Output State: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is the final value it was set to during the loop's execution, `suma` is the sum calculated based on the loop's conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.
    #
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains `T`, `info` stays as the list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `b` takes its final value which is the upper limit of the range specified in the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` plus one under certain conditions throughout the loop's iterations. Specifically, `suma` is incremented by `x + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and by an additional `1` if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true. The variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `b + 1`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each iteration. Finally, `suma` is printed after all iterations, minus 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions for incrementing `suma` do not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `(n=10, m=8)` from the example output:

- The program calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- It checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` to decide whether to increment `suma` by 1.

However, these calculations do not correctly determine whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. For instance, for the pair `(6, 2)`, the program incorrectly increments `suma` because the conditions are met, but this pair does not satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

A correct implementation would involve checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` directly for each pair `(a, b)`. The current logic in the program does not ensure this condition is met, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
