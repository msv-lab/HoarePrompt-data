Output State: **`t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, and `b` is an integer equal to the second element of `info`, `suma` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `info`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
