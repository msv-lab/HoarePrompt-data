Output State: `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is the sum of the values of `x` for each iteration plus the additional 1s added when the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is met, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is the last value of `x` calculated in the loop, which is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains 0, `info` remains unchanged, `a` remains the first element of `info`, `b` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is the cumulative sum of `x` values and additional 1s based on the given conditions, `i` is set to `b + 1` (which will be one more than the original `b`), and `x` is the final value of `x` calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
