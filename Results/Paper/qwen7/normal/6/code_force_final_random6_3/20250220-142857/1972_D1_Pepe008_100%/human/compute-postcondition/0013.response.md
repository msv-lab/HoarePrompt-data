Postcondition: `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer, `suma` is `x` + 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 1) // 2`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `((a - 1) % 4 == 0 and 1 % 4 == 0` if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is true. If the condition is false, `t` remains 0, `info` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains a positive integer, `suma` remains `x`, `i` remains 1, and `x` remains `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
