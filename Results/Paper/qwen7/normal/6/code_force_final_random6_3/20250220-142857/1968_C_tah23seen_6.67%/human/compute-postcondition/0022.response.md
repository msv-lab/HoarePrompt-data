Output State: **`i` is 6; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[6]`; `arr[7]` is greater than or equal to `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is updated to `ans[7] + ans[7]; ans[8]` is now `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[7]` (since `i` is 6) by adding `ans[6]` to its current value. Given that `ans[7]` was originally `arr[6] + ans[6]`, after the update, `ans[7]` becomes `arr[6] + ans[6] + ans[6] = arr[6] + 2 * ans[6]`. Since `ans[8]` was previously `ans[7] + ans[6]`, it is now updated to `arr[6] + 2 * ans[6] + ans[6] = arr[6] + 3 * ans[6]`. However, the problem specifies that `ans[8]` is updated to `ans[7] + ans[7]`, which means `ans[8]` is now `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
