Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
   - `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[1]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The new condition for the loop to continue would be `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, which translates to `ans[4] <= arr[4]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop can execute again.
   - Additionally, `ans[4]` and `arr[4]` must be such that the condition `ans[4] <= arr[4]` holds true.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` must be 3.
   - `ans[4]` must be less than or equal to `arr[4]`.

Given this analysis, the final state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[4]`**
