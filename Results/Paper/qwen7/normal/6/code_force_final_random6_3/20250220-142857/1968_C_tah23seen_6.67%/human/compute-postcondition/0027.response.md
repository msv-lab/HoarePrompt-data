Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` is the length of `arr` plus one, `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`, `ans[9]` is `arr[7] + ans[7]**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` to be `arr[i] + ans[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 7, `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`, and `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`, the new value for `ans[9]` is calculated as `arr[7] + ans[7]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans[7]`, and `ans[8]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
