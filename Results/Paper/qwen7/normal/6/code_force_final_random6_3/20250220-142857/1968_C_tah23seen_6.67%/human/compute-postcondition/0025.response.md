Postcondition: **`i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`**.

Explanation: Given the initial conditions and the operations performed within the if statement, the postcondition describes the final state of the variables `i`, `n`, `ans[7]`, and `ans[8]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only includes the changes made when the if condition is true.
