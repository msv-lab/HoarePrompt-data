Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[4]`
   - `ans[5]` is equal to `ans[4] + ans[3]`

3. **Determine the next iteration's condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the next index to check is `i + 1 = 4`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - We know `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[4]` from the given state.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The loop condition will then check `ans[5]` against `arr[5]`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` must be set to 4.
   - The loop condition will now check `ans[5]` against `arr[5]`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 4**
