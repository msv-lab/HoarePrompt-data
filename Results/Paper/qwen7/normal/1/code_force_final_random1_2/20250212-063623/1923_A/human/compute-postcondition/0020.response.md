Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 998, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if `x` is not -1 and `n - y - 1` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns a substring of `arr` to `z`. This substring starts at index `x` (the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`) and ends at index `n - y - 1` (the position just before the `y`-th occurrence of '1' from the end of the reversed string). If `x` is -1 (meaning '1' is not found in `arr`), or if `n - y - 1` is out of bounds, `z` remains unchanged.
