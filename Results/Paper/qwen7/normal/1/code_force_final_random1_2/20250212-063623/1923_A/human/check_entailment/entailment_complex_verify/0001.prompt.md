You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed for each iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `z` is the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if `x` is not -1 and `n - y - 1` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as an input integer `t` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. For each of the `t` inputs, the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be set based on the specific input for that iteration. The final state will reflect the processing of all `t` inputs through the loop, with `t` being 0 and all other variables reflecting their last computed values from the respective iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (number of cells), and a sequence of n binary values indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it finds and counts the number of consecutive free cells between the first and last chip, printing the count of free cells. After processing all test cases, it outputs the counts for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string of `n` characters (either '0' or '1') representing the state of the cells, where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell.

2. **Finding Chip Positions:**
   - The program converts the input string into a single string using `''.join(input('').split())`.
   - This conversion is unnecessary because the split operation will not change the string since there are no spaces in the input.
   - The program then finds the index of the first '1' (`x`) and the index of the last '1' when reversed (`y`).
   - It calculates the substring `z` between these indices.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of free cells in the substring `z`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Operations:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.
   - The logic for finding the positions of the first and last '1' and counting the free cells in between is flawed. This approach does not account for the need to move chips to the leftmost possible position to form a single block.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program should handle multiple test cases as specified, but the current implementation only processes one test case per call to `func()`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- Calculate the distance each chip needs to be moved to the leftmost chip.
- Sum these distances to get the minimum number of operations.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        leftmost_chip = None
        rightmost_chip = None
        
        for i, cell in enumerate(arr):
            if cell == '1':
                if leftmost_chip is None:
                    leftmost_chip = i
                rightmost_chip = i
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = 0
        for i, cell in enumerate(arr):
            if cell == '1' and i > leftmost_chip:
                min_operations += i - leftmost_chip - 1
        
        print(min_operations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
