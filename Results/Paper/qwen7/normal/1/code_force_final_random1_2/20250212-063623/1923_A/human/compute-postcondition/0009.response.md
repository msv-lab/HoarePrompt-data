Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 999, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices), `n` is an input integer**.

This output state reflects that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input by the user, while all other variables retain their initial conditions or are yet to be determined based on further operations.
