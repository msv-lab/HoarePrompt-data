Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is an input string with all spaces removed.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if both `x` and `y` are valid indices).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(z.count('0'))
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the following:
- `z` is a substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
- We need to count the number of '0's in this substring.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `arr`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. Therefore, we can only describe the general form of the output based on the conditions provided.

Since `z` is a substring of `arr` and we are counting the number of '0's in it, the output will be the count of '0's in the substring `z`.

Output: **the count of '0's in the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`**
