Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`. However, since `_` is a common placeholder for an unused variable in Python, it doesn't affect the state of other variables.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 999, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices).**
