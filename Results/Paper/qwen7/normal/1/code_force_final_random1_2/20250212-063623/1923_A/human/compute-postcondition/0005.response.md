Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` using slicing (`arr[::-1]`) and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is then assigned to `y`. If '1' is not found in the reversed string, `y` will be -1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
