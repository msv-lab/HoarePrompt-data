Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the correct distance between chips and free cells.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program's output is `1`, but the correct output should be `1` as well, which the program correctly calculates. However, consider another input:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The program's output is `2`, but the correct output should be `2`. Hereâ€™s how the operations should be performed:
1. Move the chip from the 3rd cell to the 2nd cell.
2. Move the chip from the 5th cell to the 4th cell.

This shows that the program does not handle the case where chips are interspersed with free cells in a way that requires multiple operations to bring them together. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
