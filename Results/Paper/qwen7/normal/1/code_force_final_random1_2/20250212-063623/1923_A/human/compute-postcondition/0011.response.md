Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 999, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1, `z` remains a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices), `x` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.**

This means that the variable `x` now holds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found. All other variables retain their previous values.
