Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 998, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If '1' is not found, it returns -1. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `z`, and `y` are updated based on the new operations performed.
