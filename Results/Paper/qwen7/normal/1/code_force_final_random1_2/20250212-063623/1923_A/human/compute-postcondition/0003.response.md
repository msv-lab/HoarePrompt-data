Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed.**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes an input string, splits it into a list of words, and then joins them back together without any spaces. The resulting string is stored in `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
