Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `smin` is updated such that its last element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and `smin[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is derived from the list `b` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains as the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must still be greater than 0.
   - The state of `smin` is not directly affected by the loop head but may change inside the loop body. However, we are only adjusting the loop head variables.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0**.
