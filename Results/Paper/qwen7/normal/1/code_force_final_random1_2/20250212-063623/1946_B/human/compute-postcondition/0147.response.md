Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[0]`, and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` (which is `smin[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `smin`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
