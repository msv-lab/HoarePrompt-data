Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
   - `smin` is a list where the last element is `suf[i+1]` if `suf[i+1] < smin[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged as `smin[1]` if `i` is 1, or `suf[3]` if `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

Given these points, let's determine the new states:

- **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
- **`n`**: `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the first element of the list `b` and does not change within the loop.
- **`smin`**: The last element of `smin` will depend on the value of `suf[i+1]` and the conditions given. However, since `i` changes, the relevant elements in `smin` and `suf` will shift.

Assuming `i` was 2 in the previous iteration (as per the given conditions for `smin`), the next value of `i` will be 3.

Therefore, the new states will be:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is still the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
- `smin` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but the exact value of `smin` depends on the values in `suf` and the conditions given. For the purpose of this task, we only need to know that the last element of `smin` will be updated based on `suf[4]` (since `i` is now 3).

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list where the last element is `suf[4]` if `suf[4] < smin[3]`, otherwise it remains unchanged as `smin[3]`**.
