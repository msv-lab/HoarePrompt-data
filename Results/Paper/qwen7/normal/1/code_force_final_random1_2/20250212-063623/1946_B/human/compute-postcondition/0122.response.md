Output State: **`sm` is equal to (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo (10 ** 9 + 7), and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by taking its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Since `sm` was initially equal to \(2 + \text{`suf[n]`}\) and was guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sm` will also satisfy the condition of being greater than or equal to 0. The modulo operation ensures that `sm` is within the range from 0 to \(10^9 + 6\).
