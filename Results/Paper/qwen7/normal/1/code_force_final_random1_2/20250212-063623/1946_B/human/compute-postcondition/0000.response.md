Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and the initial state of `n` and `k` and the list `a` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged because they have not been assigned any values yet.
