Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `sm` is `suf[0] - smin[0]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` to `sm`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `sm` is now equal to `suf[0] - smin[0]`. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
