Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `smin` is a list of length `n+1` where each element (except the first) is the minimum value between `suf[i+1]` and the previous element in `smin`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`, and the loop will start with `i = n-1` and decrement until `i = 0`.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 as per the given condition.

5. **List the required adjustments**:
   - `i` should be `n-1` to start the loop correctly.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

Given this analysis, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
