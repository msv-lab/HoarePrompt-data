Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `sm` is either equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111` is true, or `sm` remains unchanged (equal to -111) if the condition is false.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains `n + 1` as no operation changes its value. The variable `sm` is reassigned to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Whether `sm` changes to this new value depends on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111`. If the condition is true, `sm` is updated; otherwise, it remains `-111`.
