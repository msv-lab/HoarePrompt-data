Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n`
- `sm` is either equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111` is true, or `sm` remains unchanged (equal to -111) if the condition is false.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - **Variable `sm`**: The value of `sm` remains unchanged because the loop has not yet executed for `i = n + 1`. Therefore, `sm` still holds the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` will be `n + 1`.
- `sm` remains unchanged and is still either `suf[n] - smin[n]` if the condition was met, or `-111` if the condition was not met.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `sm` is either equal to `suf[n] - smin[n]` if the condition `suf[n] - smin[n] > sm or sm == -111` is true, or `sm` remains unchanged (equal to -111) if the condition is false**.
