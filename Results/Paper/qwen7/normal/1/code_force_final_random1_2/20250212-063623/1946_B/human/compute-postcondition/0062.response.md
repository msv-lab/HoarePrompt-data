Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `t-1`.

2. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sm` is equal to either `2 + suf[n] + 2 * (10^9 + 7)` or `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)`, depending on whether `sm` is less than 0.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is based on `j < t`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was `t-1`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `t`.
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` should be `t`.

5. **Maintain the Other States:**
   - `sm` and `a` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0. If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), `j` is `t`.**
