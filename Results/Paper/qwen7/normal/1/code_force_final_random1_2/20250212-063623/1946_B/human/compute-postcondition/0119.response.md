Output State: **`sm` is equal to 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\), and the value of `sm` is greater than 0; `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\)**.

Explanation: Initially, `sm` is equal to 2 plus `suf[n]`, and `sm` is less than 0. After executing `sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `sm` is increased by `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), and `sm` was initially less than 0, `a` is a positive value. Adding a positive value to `sm` (which was negative) will make `sm` positive. Therefore, `sm` is now equal to 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\), and its value is greater than 0. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is calculated based on the new value of `sm`.
