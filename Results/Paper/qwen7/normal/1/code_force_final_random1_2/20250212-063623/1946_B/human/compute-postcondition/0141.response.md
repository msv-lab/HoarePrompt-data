Output State: The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The list `suf` will contain `n+1` elements, starting from `suf[0]` up to `suf[n]`, each element being the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `l`.

In more detail, `suf` will be a list where `suf[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 4`, then `suf` will be `[1, 3, 6, 10, 14]`.
