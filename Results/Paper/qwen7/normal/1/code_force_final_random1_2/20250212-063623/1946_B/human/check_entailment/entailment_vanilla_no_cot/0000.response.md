Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sm`:**
   - The logic used to calculate `sm` is flawed. Specifically, the line `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is not correctly implementing the intended logic. The correct approach should involve using the sum of the array and leveraging the operations to maximize the sum.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Modulo Operation:**
   - The handling of the modulo operation is also incorrect. The logic `if sm < 0: ...` is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Use of `smin`:**
   - The variable `smin` is used incorrectly. It seems to be intended to track the minimum suffix sum up to each index, but the logic to update it is incorrect.

4. **Incorrect Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum calculation `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The correct approach should involve using the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand that the optimal strategy is to use the sum of the array multiple times. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        
        # If k is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can make the array fully positive
        if k >= n:
            max_sum = (total_sum * (2**k - 1)) % MOD
        else:
            max_sum = (total_sum * (2**k)) % MOD
        
        print(max_sum)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations by leveraging the properties of the sum and the number of operations.
