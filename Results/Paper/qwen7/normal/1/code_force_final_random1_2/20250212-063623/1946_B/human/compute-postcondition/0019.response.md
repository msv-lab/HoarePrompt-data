Output State: **`i` is 0; `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`; `smin` is a list containing the value of `suf[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` is 0, `suf[i + 1]` is `suf[1]`. The condition `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` is still valid because `smin[i]` (which is `smin[0]`) was already true before appending. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `smin`.
