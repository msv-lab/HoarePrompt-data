Output State: **`suf` is a list where the last element is updated to `suf[i] + l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suf`. The new value is the sum of the current value of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than 0 as per the initial condition.
