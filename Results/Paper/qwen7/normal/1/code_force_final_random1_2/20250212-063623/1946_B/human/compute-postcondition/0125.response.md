Based on the initial state provided:

- `sm` is equal to either:
  - \(2 + \text{suf}[n] + 2 \times (10^9 + 7) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) if `sm` is less than 0.
  - \(2 + \text{suf}[n] \mod (10^9 + 7)\) if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the exact value of `suf[n]` is not provided, we need to consider both cases for `sm`.

1. If `sm < 0`:
   - `sm = 2 + \text{suf}[n] + 2 \times (10^9 + 7) \mod (10^9 + 7)`
   - Since \(2 \times (10^9 + 7) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 0\), this simplifies to `sm = 2 + \text{suf}[n]`.
   - In this case, `sm` will be adjusted to be non-negative because it is initially less than 0.

2. If `sm â‰¥ 0`:
   - `sm = 2 + \text{suf}[n] \mod (10^9 + 7)`
   - This value is already non-negative.

In both cases, `sm` will be a non-negative value. Therefore, the value of `sm` will be \(2 + \text{suf}[n] \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Output: **2 + suf[n] % (10^9 + 7)**
