Output State: The final value of `sm` will be the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over all indices from 0 to `n`, updating `sm` to the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` encountered. Since `suf[i]` represents the sum of all elements in `l` up to index `i`, and `smin[i]` is the minimum value found so far among these sums up to index `i`, `suf[i] - smin[i]` gives the difference between the current sum and its minimum up to that point. By the end of the loop, `sm` will hold the highest such difference observed across all possible subarrays of `l`.
