Output State: **`sm` is -111, `suf` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `l` up to that index, `n` is the length of `l`, and `smin` is a list where each element (except the first one) is the minimum value found so far among the sums in `suf` up to that index.**

Explanation: The variable `sm` is assigned the value `-111`. The values of `suf`, `n`, and `smin` remain unchanged from their initial states.
