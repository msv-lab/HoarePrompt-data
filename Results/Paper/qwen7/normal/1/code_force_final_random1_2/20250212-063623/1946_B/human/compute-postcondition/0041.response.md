Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is either:
     - `suf[0] - smin[0] > sm` or
     - `sm == -111`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n + 1):`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless the loop condition is not met, but since we are only adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, we assume the loop condition is met.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is incremented to 1, the loop will continue if `i < n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration and it is now 1, the loop will continue as long as `1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `n >= 0`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, which is incremented to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The postcondition for the loop to continue is still valid because `i` is now 1 and `n` is a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1**.
