Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `a` is the integer part of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), `j` is `t`, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `suf` is a list of cumulative sums of the list `l`, and `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `smin` is updated such that if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is appended with `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` has its last element appended with `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `smin` is updated such that its last element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `smin` contains at least two elements. If `suf[3]` is less than `smin[2]`, then `smin[3]` is set to `suf[3]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged with its third element being `smin[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
