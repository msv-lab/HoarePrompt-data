Output State: **`sm` is equal to (2 ** k * `sm` - `sm`).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be `(2 ** k * sm - sm)`. Since `sm` was initially the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, the new value of `sm` is calculated using the given expression. The values of `suf`, `smin`, and `n` remain unchanged from their final states after the loop.
