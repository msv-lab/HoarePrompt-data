Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `j` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `t`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition for `sm` is given. The value of `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Postcondition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `t`.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the next iteration:

- `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `t` remains the same.
- The postcondition for `sm` and the value of `a` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is incremented by 1, `t` is the same, `sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is less than 0), or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0). The value of `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\)**.

To express this clearly:

**State: `j` is 1 more than the previous value, `t` is the same, `sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is less than 0), or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0). The value of `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\)**.
