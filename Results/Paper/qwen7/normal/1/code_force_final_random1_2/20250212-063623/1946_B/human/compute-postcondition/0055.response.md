Output State: **`sm` is equal to 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\), and the value of `sm` is greater than 0; `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\)**.

Explanation: Initially, `sm` is equal to 2 plus `suf[n]`, and the value of `sm` is less than 0. This means `sm < 0`. The value of `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\). After executing `sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `sm` is increased by `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), and `sm` was initially negative, `a` is a positive fraction. Adding a positive value to a negative `sm` will make `sm` positive. Therefore, the new value of `sm` is 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\), and the value of `sm` is now greater than 0. The value of `a` remains as the absolute value of the new `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), but since `sm` is now positive, `a` will be a positive fraction.
