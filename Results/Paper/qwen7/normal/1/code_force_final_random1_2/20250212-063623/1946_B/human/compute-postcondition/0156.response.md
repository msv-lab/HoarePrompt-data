Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `smin` is a list where the last element is `suf[4] + 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4. So, the last element of `smin` is updated to `suf[4]`. The value of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `smin` is updated based on the new appended value.
