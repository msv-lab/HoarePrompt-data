Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer.
   - `suf` is a list with its first two elements being `suf[0] + b[0]` and `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer).
   - The list `suf` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `suf` is a list with its first two elements being `suf[0] + b[0]` and `suf[0] + b[0] + b[1]`**
