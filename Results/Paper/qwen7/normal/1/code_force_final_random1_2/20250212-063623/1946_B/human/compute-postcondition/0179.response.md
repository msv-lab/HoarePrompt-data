Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `sm` is `2 ** k * (suf[n] - smin[n]) - (suf[n] - smin[n])`, and `smin` is a list containing the minimum cumulative sums encountered during the iterations.**

Explanation: The code `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is executed after the loop. Initially, `sm` is defined as `suf[n] - smin[n]`. After the loop, `sm` is updated to `2 ** k * (suf[n] - smin[n]) - (suf[n] - smin[n])`. This simplifies to `(2 ** k - 1) * (suf[n] - smin[n])`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `smin` remain unchanged from their initial or updated states within the loop.
