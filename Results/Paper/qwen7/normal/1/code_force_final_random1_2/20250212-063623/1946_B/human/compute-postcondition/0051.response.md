Output State: **`sm` is equal to 2 + `suf[n]`**

The initial value of `sm` is 2. The code updates `sm` by adding `suf[n]` to its current value. Since the exact value of `suf[n]` is not specified, it remains as `suf[n]`. Therefore, the updated value of `sm` is the sum of its initial value (2) and `suf[n]`. The states of other variables are not affected.
