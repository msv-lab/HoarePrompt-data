Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
   - `sm` is `suf[0] - smin[0]`.

3. **Condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues if `suf[0] - smin[0] > sm` or `sm == -111`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing within the loop.
   - The condition `suf[0] - smin[0] > sm` or `sm == -111` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. `i` should be set to 1, and `n` remains the same (the integer value of the first element of the list `b`).

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`
- `sm` remains `suf[0] - smin[0]`

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, `sm` is `suf[0] - smin[0]`**
