Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0; `smin` now contains the element `suf[3]` (since `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` and `i` is 2).**

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, `n` retains its original value as the first element of list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, and the list `smin` now includes the element `suf[3]` due to the append operation.
