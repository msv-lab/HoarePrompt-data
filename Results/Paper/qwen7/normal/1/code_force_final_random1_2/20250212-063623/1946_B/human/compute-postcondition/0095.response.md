Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `smin` is a list containing at least two elements. If `suf[3]` (which is `smin[2]` since `i` is 2) is less than `smin[1]`, then `smin[2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `smin[2]` is added to the list `smin`.
