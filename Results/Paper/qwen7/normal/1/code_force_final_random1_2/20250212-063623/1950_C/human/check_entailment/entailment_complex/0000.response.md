Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It correctly identifies whether the time is in the AM or PM period by checking if the hour part is greater than or equal to 12.
- The function correctly handles the special case where the hour is '00' by printing '12'.
- The function correctly formats and prints the time in the required 12-hour format with 'AM' or 'PM'.
- There are no logical errors in the function, and it follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
