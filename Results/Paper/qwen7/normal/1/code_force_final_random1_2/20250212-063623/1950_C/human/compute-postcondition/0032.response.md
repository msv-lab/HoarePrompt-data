Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1440\) and `t` is incremented by 1; `s` is an input string from user; `h` is the first two characters of the input string `s`. In both cases (whether `int(h) <= 12` is true or false), `t` remains an integer within the specified range and is incremented by 1, `s` remains an input string from the user, and `h` remains the first two characters of the input string `s`.
