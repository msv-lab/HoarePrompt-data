You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:

        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Annotated Code: 
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, s is an input string representing a valid time in the format "hh:mm", and h is the first two characters of s. If h is '00', no changes are made to t and h. If h is not '00', no changes are made to t and h after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:XX AM" if the original time is before noon (i.e., the hour part is less than 12), and "12:XX PM" if the original time is after noon (i.e., the hour part is 12 or greater).

In the provided code, the condition `if int(h) <= 12:` will include both the cases where the hour is 12 (which should be "12:XX PM") and the cases where the hour is less than 12 (which should be "12:XX AM"). Therefore, the code incorrectly handles the transition from 12 to 1 PM and from 12 to 12 AM.

For example, for the input "12:00", the program outputs "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
