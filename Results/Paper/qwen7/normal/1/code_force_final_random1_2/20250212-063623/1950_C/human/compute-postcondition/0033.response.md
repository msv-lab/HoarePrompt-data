Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1440\) and `t` is incremented by 1; `s` is an input string from user; `h` is the first two characters of the input string `s`. If the integer value represented by `h` is less than or equal to 12, no change is made to `t` and `h`. Otherwise, no change is made to `t` and `h`.
