To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1440\).
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `h` is the first two characters of the input string `s`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
   ```

Given the print statement, it will take the first two characters of the string `s` and convert them to an integer, then subtract 12 from this integer. The result will be formatted with a leading zero if necessary and printed without a newline (`end=''`).

Let's analyze the possible values for `h`:
- `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`. For example, if `s = "1234"`, then `h = "12"`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Suppose `h = "12"`. Converting `"12"` to an integer gives `12`.
   - Subtracting 12 from 12 results in `0`.
   - Formatting `0` with a leading zero gives `"00"`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output `"00"`.

Since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we can generalize the output based on the given formula.

Output: **00**
