Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is either 2 or 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is 1. If the condition `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` is false, then `y` is updated based on the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. If the condition is true, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`. If the condition is false, `y` remains unchanged.
