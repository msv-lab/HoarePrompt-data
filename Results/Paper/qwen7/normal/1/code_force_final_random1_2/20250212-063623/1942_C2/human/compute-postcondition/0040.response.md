Postcondition: **`ii` is equal to `len(a)`, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is the value of `y` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the final value of `ans` calculated as `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments made during the loop, and `tmp` is a list containing all the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` added during the loop when the conditions were met. Additionally, the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) != 2` holds true.**
