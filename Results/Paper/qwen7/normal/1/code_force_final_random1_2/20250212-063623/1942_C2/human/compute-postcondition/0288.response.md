Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - `next_elem` is defined based on the condition `i == x - 1`.
   - `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - Depending on the value of `gap`, either the `odd` or `even` list gets an additional element.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `x - 1` (if it was `x - 2` before).
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `x - 1` (since `i` starts from 0).

5. **Update the State**:
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `x - 1` (since it was `x - 2` before and now it is incremented by 1).
   - `next_elem` will be `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`.
   - `gap` is recalculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - Depending on the value of `gap`, either the `odd` or `even` list gets an additional element.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, the `odd` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, the `even` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap`.**
