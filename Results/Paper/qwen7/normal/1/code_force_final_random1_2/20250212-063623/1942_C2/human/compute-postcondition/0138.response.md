Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, `ans` will be the count of consecutive pairs in `a` that differ by 2 or an even number where `y` was sufficient to decrement. `tmp` will contain the integer division of the differences by 2 for those pairs where the difference was even and `y` allowed it. Additionally, the first element of list `a` plus `n` minus the last element of list `a` equals 2.**
