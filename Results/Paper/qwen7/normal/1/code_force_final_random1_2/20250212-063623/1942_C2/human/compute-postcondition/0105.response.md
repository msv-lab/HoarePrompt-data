Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(a)`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` must start from 1 for the loop to begin its first iteration.
   - The list `a` must have at least 2 elements (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a) - 1`). If `a` had fewer than 2 elements, the loop would not execute.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variables `ans`, `x`, `y`, `ii`, `n`, and `tmp` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `a` should have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements**.
