Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is undefined, `odd` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `even` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_elem` based on the condition. Since the condition `i == x - 1` is used, `next_elem` will be `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise it will be `a[i + 1]`. However, the code does not define or update the values of `gap`, `odd`, and `even` lists directly, so their states remain as per the initial conditions.
