Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `gap` as the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1. Since `next_elem` is defined based on the value of `i` relative to `x`, and `a[i]` is a part of the list `a`, these values remain unchanged. The new variable `gap` is introduced and its value is determined by the current values of `next_elem` and `a[i]`.
