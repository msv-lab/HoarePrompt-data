Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - ((i_prev + 1) // 2) - c`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + 1 + y * 2 + i`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `(i_prev + 1) // 2`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `sx += i` adds the value of `i` to `sx`. Since `i` is equal to `i_prev + 1`, `sx` is updated to include this new value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
