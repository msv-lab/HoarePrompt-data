Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2. In this case, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. If the condition in the if statement is not met, the values of `a`, `i`, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
