Output State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 4, `y` is 0, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since the initial state of `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 4 (which is 4 because `y` is initially 0), and `y` remains 0 after the input, the only changes are the assignment of `n` and `x` with input values, while `ans` remains unchanged in terms of its initial condition.
