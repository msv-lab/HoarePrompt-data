Postcondition: `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 2 times the initial value of `y`, and `y` is 0. If `y < gap // 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition.
