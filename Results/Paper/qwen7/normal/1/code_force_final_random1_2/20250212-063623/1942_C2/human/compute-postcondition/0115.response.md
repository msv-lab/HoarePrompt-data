Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2; `tmp` is a list containing one element which is the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2; `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2, and `y` is decreased by the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2 minus 1.
