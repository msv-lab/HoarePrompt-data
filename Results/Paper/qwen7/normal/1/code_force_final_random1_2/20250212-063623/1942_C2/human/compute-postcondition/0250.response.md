Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `x - 1`
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `t` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `a` is a sorted set of integers where each element is one less than its original value in the list
   - `i` is 2
   - `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`
   - `t1` is not in `st` while `t2` is in `st`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2, and the loop runs as long as `i < x`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` changes to `3`
   - All other states remain the same since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is `x - 1`, `y` is an input integer, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted set of integers where each element is one less than its original value in the list, `i` is 3, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`, and `t1` is not in `st` while `t2` is in `st`.**
