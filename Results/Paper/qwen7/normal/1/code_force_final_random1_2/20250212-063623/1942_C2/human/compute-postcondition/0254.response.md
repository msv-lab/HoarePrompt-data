Postcondition: `ans` is `x`, `y` is an input integer, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted set of integers where each element is one less than its original value in the list, `i` is 3, `t1` is `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[3] + 2) % n`, and if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` remains `x`.
