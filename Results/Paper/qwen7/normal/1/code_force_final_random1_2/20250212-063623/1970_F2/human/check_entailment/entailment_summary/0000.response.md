Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to handle movements of entities on the grid. However, the provided execution summary describes `func_1` incorrectly. According to the code, `func_1` should take a coordinate `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and return the new coordinate after moving in the specified direction. The provided execution summary suggests that `func_1` takes a list of strings and an integer, which is incorrect. The function should be correctly implemented to handle movements.

2. **Movement Handling**: The code correctly handles the movement of players and the Quaffle. The movement logic is consistent with the problem statement, and the function `func_1` is used appropriately to update the positions of players and the Quaffle.

3. **Elimination Logic**: The logic for eliminating players when they collide with a Bludger is correct. Players are sorted alphabetically before printing their elimination, which is as required.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is correct. Points are awarded to the appropriate team when a player scores in the opponent's goal, and the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field. The final score is printed correctly.

5. **Input Parsing**: The initial parsing of the input to set up the field and players is correct.

6. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting is correct, including the order of events and the final score.

Given these observations, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
