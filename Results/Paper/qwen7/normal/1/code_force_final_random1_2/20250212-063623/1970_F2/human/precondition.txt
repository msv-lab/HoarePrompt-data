N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, where each string contains M characters. The field contains goals for two teams, players for both teams, the Quaffle, and optionally one Bludger. The number of players per team is between 1 and 10. The number of goals per team is between 1 and 5. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is described by a string containing the entity performing the action and the details of the action (movement, catching, or throwing the Quaffle).
