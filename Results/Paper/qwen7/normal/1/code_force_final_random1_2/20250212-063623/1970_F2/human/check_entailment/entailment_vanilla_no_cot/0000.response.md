Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined correctly, but it is not used in the main logic of the program. Instead, the movements are directly applied using dictionary `mouvements`. This discrepancy suggests that the function might have been intended to be used but was not called properly.

2. **Handling of `.B` (Bludger)**: The handling of the Bludger is incomplete. The code checks for the presence of `.B` in the `players` dictionary but does not update the position of the Bludger or check for collisions with players. This could lead to incorrect elimination of players or incorrect movement of the Bludger.

3. **Quaffle Handling**: The Quaffle's position is updated correctly, but the logic for checking if a player is eliminated when moving towards the Bludger is missing. Specifically, the code should check if the player and Bludger are on the same cell and then eliminate the player.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic seems to be mostly correct, but there are a few issues:
   - When a player scores, the Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field, but the code does not explicitly handle this.
   - The final score is printed correctly, but the intermediate steps for scoring and elimination are not fully implemented.

5. **Sorting Eliminations**: The sorting of eliminated players is done correctly, but the logic for checking if a player is eliminated when moving towards the Bludger is missing.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant parts of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

By ensuring that the Bludger logic is correctly implemented and that the Quaffle is moved to the middle of the field when a player scores, the program should work as expected.
