Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Player Elimination**: The program does not correctly handle the elimination of players when a Bludger hits them. Specifically, the `func_1` function is used to update player positions, but it does not check for collisions with Bludgers. When a player is hit by a Bludger, the player should be eliminated, and the Quaffle should remain at the position of the collision.

2. **Incorrect Quaffle Movement After Player Elimination**: When a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle should remain at the position of the collision. However, the program does not account for this scenario properly. Instead, it resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field, which is incorrect.

3. **Missing Input Validation**: The program does not validate the input to ensure that the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle are within the bounds of the field. This could lead to out-of-bounds errors during movement.

4. **Incorrect Output Format for Player Eliminations**: The program prints player eliminations in the correct format, but it does not sort the players alphabetically when multiple players are eliminated simultaneously. The sorting logic is missing.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue with player elimination and Quaffle movement:

**Input:**
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
10 R0 ELIMINATED
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

In this example, the red player (R0) is eliminated when it collides with the Bludger, but the Quaffle is not handled correctly. The Quaffle should remain at the position of the collision, but the program incorrectly resets it to the middle of the field.

These issues indicate that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
