Output State: **i is 3, n is greater than 3, res is an input string, and if res equals '<', then best is 3.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to 3 (since the loop increments `i` from `n-1` down to 1, and `n` must be greater than 3 based on the third iteration's conditions). The variable `n` will be greater than 3 because the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. The variable `res` will be the input string received during the last iteration of the loop. If `res` equals '<' during any iteration, `best` will be updated to the current value of `i`, which will be 3 in the final iteration.
