Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `best` is set to `n-1`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 2, so let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2.
   - `k` is set to `n-1`, so if `n` is 2, then `k` is 1.
   - `res` is an input string, but it is not used in the print statement.

2. **Print statement analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('!', k, best, flush=True)`.
   - `'!'` is a literal string.
   - `k` is `n-1`, which is 1 if `n` is 2.
   - `best` is `n-1`, which is also 1 if `n` is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `! 1 1`.

Output: **! 1 1**
