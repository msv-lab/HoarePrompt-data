Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 4, `res` is a new input string**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user using the `input()` function. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than 3 still holds true.
