Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is defined as being greater than 3 but no specific value is given.
- `res` is an input string, but its specific value is not provided.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Given the values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information.
- `best` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

Therefore, the print statement will include the literal `'?'`, the undefined variables `k` and `best`, and the value of `i` which is 3.

Output: **'? k best k 3'**
