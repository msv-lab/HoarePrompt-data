Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than 1 but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` and `best` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Since the question asks us to determine exactly what will be printed and we don't have explicit values for `k` and `best`, we need to describe them in terms of their roles or how they might be used.

Given the lack of specific values for `k` and `best`, the output will include placeholders for these variables.

Output: **'? [k] [best] [k] 1'** (where `[k]` and `[best]` represent the unknown values of `k` and `best` respectively)
