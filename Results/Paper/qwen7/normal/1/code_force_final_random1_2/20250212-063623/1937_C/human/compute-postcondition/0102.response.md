Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2 but does not have an explicit value.

The `k` variable is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is undefined. However, since the `print` statement includes `k` without any assignment, we can assume `k` is not being used in the calculation and might be a placeholder or an undefined variable.

Given this, the `print` statement will output the following string with the placeholders for `k` and `n`:
Output: **'? 0 k 0 3'**
