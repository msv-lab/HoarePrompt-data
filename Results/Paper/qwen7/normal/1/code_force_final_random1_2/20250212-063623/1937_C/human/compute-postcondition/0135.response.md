Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `best` is `n-1` if `res` is equal to '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, the value of `best` remains 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the final value of `n`. The variable `best` will be set to `n-1` if the input `res` was '<' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`. If `res` was not '<' in any of those iterations, `best` will remain 0. The variable `n` will remain unchanged and must be greater than or equal to 2, and `res` will be an input string as it was initially.
