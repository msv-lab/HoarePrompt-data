Output State: **i is n, k is n, n is greater than or equal to 2, res is an input string, and if res equals '<' for any iteration, k is updated to the current value of i during that iteration.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, the value of `i` increases by 1. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`. Since `k` is updated to the current value of `i` whenever `res` is '<', and considering the loop runs from `2` to `n-1`, `k` will also be equal to `n` if `res` was '<' for the last iteration (when `i = n-1`). If `res` was not '<' for any iteration, `k` would still be `n-1`. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that `k` will be `n` after the loop completes, as it is updated to `i` which reaches `n-1` and then `i` increments to `n` outside the loop. The other variables (`n` and `res`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
