Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query and waits for the result.
   - It correctly handles flushing the output after printing.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function prints the final answer and flushes the output.
   - It is used to submit the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is the main logic to solve the problem.
   - **Initial Check for \(n = 2\)**:
     - If \(n = 2\), it directly prints the answer \([0, 1]\) or \([1, 0]\).
   - **Finding the Maximum Index**:
     - It iterates through indices from 0 to \(n-1\) to find the index with the highest bitwise OR when paired with 0.
     - This is done using the query `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to \(i\).
   - **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
     - It initializes `min_indices` with the `max_index`.
     - It iterates again to find indices that have the same bitwise OR value as `max_index` when paired with `min_indices[0]`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to \([i]\).
     - If the result is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `min_indices`.
   - **Final Selection**:
     - It selects the minimum index from `min_indices` (excluding `max_index`).
     - It uses the query `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to confirm the selection.
     - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to \(i\).
   - **Prints the Final Answer**:
     - It prints the indices `max_index` and `min_index`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling \(n = 2\)**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the program correctly identifies the permutation and outputs the indices \([0, 1]\) or \([1, 0]\).

2. **Finding the Maximum Index**:
   - The logic to find the index with the highest bitwise OR when paired with 0 is correct. This ensures that we are focusing on the most significant bits.

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
   - The logic to find indices that have the same bitwise OR value as `max_index` is correct. This helps in narrowing down the search space.

4. **Final Selection**:
   - The logic to select the minimum index from `min_indices` is correct. This ensures that we are finding the pair with the maximum XOR.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes at most \(3n\) queries, which is within the allowed limit.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case \(n = 2\) correctly.
   - The program correctly identifies the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Conclusion

The given program is designed to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) using at most \(3n\) queries. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

**Correctness: True**
