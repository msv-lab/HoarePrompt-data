Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The postcondition is that `res` is a string. Additionally, if `res` is equal to '<', then `k` is set to `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` and `n`, we need to consider how these variables change.
   - `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `res` and `k` are not directly controlled by the loop itself but by the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we don't need to change `res` or `k`.

Given the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

6. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

7. **Final State**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is a string, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Since the exact values of `i_end` and `n` are not provided, we express the state in terms of these variables.
