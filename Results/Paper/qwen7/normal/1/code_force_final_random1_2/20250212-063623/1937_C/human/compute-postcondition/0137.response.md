Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n`, `n` will be greater than or equal to 2, and `best` will be `n-1` if for every query from 1 to `n-1`, the response `res` was `<`. If any response was `>`, then `best` will remain 0. The variable `k` will hold the value of `n-1` after the second inner loop completes, and it will not change further as the loop terminates.
