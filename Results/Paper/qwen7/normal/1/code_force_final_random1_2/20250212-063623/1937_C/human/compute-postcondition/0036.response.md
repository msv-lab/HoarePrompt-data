Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `res` is an input string. If `res` equals '<', the postcondition remains as `best` being 2, `i` being 2, `n` being greater than 1, and `res` being an input string. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition.
