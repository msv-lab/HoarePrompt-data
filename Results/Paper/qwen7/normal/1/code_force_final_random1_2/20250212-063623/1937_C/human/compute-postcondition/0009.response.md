Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is 2 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is in the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted)
   - `res` is an input string with the current value being '<' (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop is defined as `range(2, n)`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
   - `k` is 2 (unchanged)
   - `i` is 3
   - `res` is an input string with the current value being '<' (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string with the current value being '<'**
