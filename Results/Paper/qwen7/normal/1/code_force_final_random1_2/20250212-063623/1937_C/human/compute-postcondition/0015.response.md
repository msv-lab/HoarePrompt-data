Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `res` is an input string
   - If `res` equals '<', `k` is set to 3 (though this doesn't affect the loop directly)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 4, `res` is an input string**
