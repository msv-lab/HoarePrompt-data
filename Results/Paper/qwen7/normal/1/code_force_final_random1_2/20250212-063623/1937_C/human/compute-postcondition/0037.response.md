Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `res` is an input string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Maintain the other states**: The state of `res` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `res` is an input string**.
