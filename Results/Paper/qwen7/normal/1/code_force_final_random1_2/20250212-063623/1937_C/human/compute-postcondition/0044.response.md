Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `res` is an input string.
- If `res` equals '<', then `best` is 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. However, since it is not mentioned that `k` is initialized elsewhere, we assume it is not part of the initial state and thus not directly calculable from the given information.
- `best` is 3 if `res` equals '<'. Since `res` is an input string and no specific value is given, we consider the condition where `res` equals '<'.

Given this, the print statement will output:
Output: **! [k] 3** (where [k] represents the value of `k`, which is unknown but assumed to be part of the print statement as per the code).
