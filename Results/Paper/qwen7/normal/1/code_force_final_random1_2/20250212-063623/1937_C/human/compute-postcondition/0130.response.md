Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not relevant to the print statement either.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as 3. However, the values of `k` and `best` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. 

Given the format of the print statement, it will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k` again, and finally `i`.

Output: **'? [k] [best] [k] 3' (where [k] and [best] are the values of the variables k and best, respectively)**
