Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions.
- Function `func_1()` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
- Function `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.
- The execution summary for `func_1()` indicates that it correctly iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and updates the count based on the given conditions.
- The execution summary for `func_2()` indicates that it correctly handles multiple test cases and does not return any value but ensures the number of remaining test cases is updated.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions together correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
