### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
   - `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(x \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it updates the count `cnt` by adding the minimum of \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\).

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Annotations Analysis**:
   - The annotations suggest that the program correctly calculates the count of valid pairs for a single test case.
   - The state analysis shows that the program correctly increments `x` and `y` and updates `cnt` based on the conditions.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and the sum of \(n\) and \(m\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - The program handles these constraints appropriately by iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking the conditions.

7. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided examples and the output states in the annotations match the expected results.
   - The program correctly handles the conditions and updates the count `cnt` for each valid pair.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions to update the count `cnt`. The logic for checking the conditions and updating the count appears to be correct based on the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
