### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summaries step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function processes a single test case and updates the count of valid pairs.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes up to 10,000 test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` and ensures that the variable `t` (number of remaining test cases) is updated correctly.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function starts by initializing `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It then iterates through possible values of `x` such that \(x \times x \le n\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates through possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
   - Inside the inner loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the condition is met, it updates the count `cnt` using the minimum of two values:
     - \(n / ((x + y) \times x)\)
     - \(m // ((x + y) \times y)\)

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by calling `func_1()` and updates the variable `t` to reflect the number of remaining test cases.

#### Validation:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The outer loop iterates through possible values of `x` efficiently using \(x \times x \le n\).
  - The inner loop iterates through possible values of `y` efficiently using \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
  - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked to ensure that the greatest common divisor is 1.
  - The count `cnt` is updated correctly using the minimum of the two values calculated.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly processes up to 10,000 test cases.
  - It calls `func_1()` for each test case and updates the variable `t` to reflect the number of remaining test cases.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The logic for checking the conditions and updating the count appears to be correct based on the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate.
