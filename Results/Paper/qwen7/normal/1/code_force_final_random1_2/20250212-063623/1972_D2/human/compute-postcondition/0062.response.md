Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is at least 55, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 8, and `cnt` is 36.

To understand this output state, let's break it down:

- The variable `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop. After executing the loop 4 times (since we start counting from the first iteration), `x` will be 5.
- For the loop to continue executing, the condition `x * x <= n` must hold true. Given that the previous state had `x` as 4 and `n` was at least 21, and considering the increment pattern, `n` must now be at least 55 to allow `x` to reach 5.
- The variable `y` starts from 1 in each inner loop and increments based on the conditions given. The previous state showed `y` as 8 when `x` was 4, so `y` must be greater than 8 when `x` is 5.
- The variable `cnt` accumulates based on the conditions inside the loops. From the given outputs, we can see that `cnt` increases by 3 with each full iteration of the outer loop (from 12 to 15 to 24). Following this pattern, after 4 iterations, `cnt` would be 36.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will have `x` equal to 5, `n` at least 55, `m` at least 7, `y` greater than 8, and `cnt` equal to 36.
