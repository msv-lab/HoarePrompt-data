State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The initial state of `t` being an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0 or negative. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to start executing.

No other adjustments are necessary because the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t` are the only objects in the loop head, and the condition for the loop to execute is solely dependent on `t`.
