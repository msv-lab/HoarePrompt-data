To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
\[
(x + y) \cdot x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) \cdot y \leq m
\]

Given the current states at the end of the previous iteration:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( n \) must be at least 6
- \( m \) must be at least 7
- \( y = 2 \)
- \( cnt = 13 \)

First, let's substitute the values of \( x \) and \( y \) into the loop condition:
\[
(2 + 2) \cdot 2 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (2 + 2) \cdot 2 \leq m
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 4 \cdot 2 \leq m
\]
Which further simplifies to:
\[
8 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 8 \leq m
\]

Since \( n \) must be at least 6 and \( m \) must be at least 7, these conditions are already satisfied because \( n \geq 8 \) and \( m \geq 8 \).

Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time based on the current values of \( x \), \( y \), \( n \), and \( m \). No adjustments are needed for the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 7, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 13**
