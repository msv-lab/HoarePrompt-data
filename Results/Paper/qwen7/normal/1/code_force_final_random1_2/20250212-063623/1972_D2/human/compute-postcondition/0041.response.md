Output State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 6, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 4, and `cnt` is 15.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 2, so after executing this line, `x` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` is still at least 6, `m` is still at least 7, `y` is still greater than 4, and `cnt` is still 15.
