Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks if the conditions are met. The function `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. The logic for checking the conditions and updating the count appears to be correct based on the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints.
