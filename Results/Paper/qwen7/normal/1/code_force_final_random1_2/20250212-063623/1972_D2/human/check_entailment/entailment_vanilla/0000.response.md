Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`.
     - For each `x`, it initializes `y` to 1.
     - It checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If these conditions hold, it proceeds.
     - It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
     - If the GCD is 1, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly implemented.
   - The current implementation checks if `x` and `y` have a GCD of 1, which does not necessarily mean that `y \cdot \gcd(x, y)` is a multiple of `x + y`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not relevant to the problem statement.
   - The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - The current approach does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the required condition.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
2. Check if `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function calls for testing
# func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
