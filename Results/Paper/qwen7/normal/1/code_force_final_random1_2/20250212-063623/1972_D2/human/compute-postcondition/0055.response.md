Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.**

This means that the variable `cnt` has been updated by adding to its current value the smaller of the two expressions `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `m` remain unchanged from their previous states.
