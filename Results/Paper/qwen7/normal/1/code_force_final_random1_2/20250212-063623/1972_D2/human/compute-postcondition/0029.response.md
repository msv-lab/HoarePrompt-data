Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 7, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 13**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was initially 1, after executing this line, `y` becomes 2. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
