Output State: `x` is 2, `n` is at least 6, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 4, and `cnt` is 15.

To explain this output state in natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `x` remains 2 because it does not change within the loop. The values of `n` and `m` remain their minimum requirements of at least 6 and 7 respectively, as they do not change within the loop. The variable `y` will be greater than 4 since the loop increments `y` by 1 each time and has executed at least 4 times. Finally, `cnt` remains 15 because once the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met, the loop terminates, and no further additions to `cnt` occur.
