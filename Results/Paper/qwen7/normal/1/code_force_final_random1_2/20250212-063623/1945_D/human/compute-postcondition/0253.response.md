The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `custos`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `custos`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `custos`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the next element in `custos`. For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must still have at least one more element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `c` is now the next element in `custos`, and `custos` must still have at least one more element.

State: **`c` is the next element in `custos`, `custos` must have at least one more element**
