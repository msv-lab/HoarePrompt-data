Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` in reverse order.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `y` is the last element in the list `a`.
   - `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`.
   - `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`.
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `y` is the last element in the list `a`.
   - `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`.
   - `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`.
   - `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on the condition.
   - `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.
   - `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`.
   - `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is the last element in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop runs in reverse order).
   - Therefore, `y` should be `y - 1`.

5. **Check the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `y >= max_p - 1`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `y` becomes `y - 1`.
   - `num_fila` remains unchanged.
   - `max_p` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains an empty list.
   - `b_values` remains unchanged.
   - `custos` remains unchanged.
   - `custo` remains unchanged.
   - `a_values` remains unchanged.
   - `num_fila` remains unchanged.
   - `max_p` remains unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 1, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on the condition, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, and `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`.**
