Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `b_values` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a_values` now contains the integer value of all elements in `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `y` will be set to the last element of the list `a`. The list `a_values` will contain all the integer values of the elements in `a`, as each element was appended to `a_values` during each iteration of the loop. All other variables remain in their initial or updated states as described in the previous states.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a non-empty list of strings obtained from the input, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list with the last element of `b` converted to an integer appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a non-empty list of strings with one less element, `y` is the second-to-last element in the list `b`, `b_values` is a list with the last element of `b` converted to an integer and appended with the integer value of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a non-empty list of strings with one less element, `y` is the last element in the list `b`, `b_values` is a list with the last element of `b` converted to an integer and appended with the integer value of `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
