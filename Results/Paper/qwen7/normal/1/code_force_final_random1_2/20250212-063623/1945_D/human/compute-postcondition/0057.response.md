Output State: **`total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is now `na_frente - 2`, and `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The value of `v` is updated to `na_frente - 2`. Since the code does not involve updating `best`, its value remains unchanged.
