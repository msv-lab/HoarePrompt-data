Output State: `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` in the range from `na_frente` to `-1`, inclusive. `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `pos_final` is the integer input from the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers, and `best` is the smallest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` in the range from `na_frente` to `pos_final`, inclusive, that is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total` will be the cumulative cost of the optimal path chosen at each step, where the path can either "trocar_a" (change to the left) or "passar_b" (pass to the right), depending on which option has the lower cost. The value of `na_frente` will be updated to reflect the end of the range considered, `n` will be one more than `na_frente`, `pos_final` will remain unchanged, and `best` will hold the lowest possible accumulated cost up to `pos_final`.
