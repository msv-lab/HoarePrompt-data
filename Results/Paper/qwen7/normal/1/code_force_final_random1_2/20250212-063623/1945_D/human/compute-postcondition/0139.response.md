Postcondition: `total` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, the values of `total`, `na_frente`, `n`, `v`, and `best` remain unchanged.
