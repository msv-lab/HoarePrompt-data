Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than the original value of `na_frente`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `total` is 0, `best` is 10
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4, `total` is increased by either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition, `v` is a value such that `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4; `total` is increased by either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition; `v` is now `na_frente - 1`; `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is increased by either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition; `v` is now `na_frente - 2`; and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
