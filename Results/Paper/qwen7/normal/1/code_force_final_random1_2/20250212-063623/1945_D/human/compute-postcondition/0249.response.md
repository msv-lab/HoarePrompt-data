Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for c in custos:`. The only variable involved here is `c`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`:**
   Since the loop iterates over each element in `custos`, the initial value of `c` must be one of the elements in `custos`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `custos`.
   - Inside the loop, the variable `c` takes the value of each element in `custos` sequentially.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables:**
   - `y` will be 0.
   - `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`.
   - `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`.
   - `b` will remain an empty list.
   - `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`.
   - `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration.
   - `custo` will be the final sum calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`.
   - If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; `custos.append(custo)` appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `custos`, the initial value of `c` should be one of the elements in `custos`.
   - The other variables (`y`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, `b`, `b_values`, `custo`, `a_values`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values will be determined within the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`c` is one of the elements in `custos`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute correctly, as `c` will take on each value in `custos` during the iterations.
