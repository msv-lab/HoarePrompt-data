Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3 2
5 3 2
4 1 2
```

- For the first person (`i=1`), the cost to swap with Kirill (`j=0`) is `a_0 = 5` and the cost to pass through (`b_0 = 4`) is less than the swap cost.
- For the second person (`i=2`), the cost to swap with Kirill (`j=1`) is `a_1 = 3` and the cost to pass through (`b_1 = 1`) is less than the swap cost.
- For the third person (`i=3`), the cost to swap with Kirill (`j=2`) is `a_2 = 2` and the cost to pass through (`b_2 = 2`) is equal to the swap cost.

The program incorrectly calculates the total cost without properly considering the cumulative effect of passing through multiple people. It should keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position and update it accordingly. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to maintain a running total of the minimum cost to reach each position and ensure that it correctly updates the total cost when swapping or passing through people.
