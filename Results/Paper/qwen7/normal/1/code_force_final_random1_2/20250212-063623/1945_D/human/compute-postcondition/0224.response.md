Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `y` and `max_p`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `y` is `max_p - 1`.
   - `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1.
   - `custo` is updated based on conditions involving `a_values` and `b_values`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Body**:
   - The loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than 0.

5. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `y` is currently `max_p - 1`, in the next iteration, `y` will be `max_p - 2`.
   - `max_p` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `custo` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, but since the loop condition itself does not change `max_p` or `y`, we only need to adjust `y`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `y` will be `max_p - 2`.
   - `max_p` remains the same.
   - `custo` is not directly affected by the loop head, so its value remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `custo` is increased by either `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` and optionally by `a_values[0]` if `y` equals 1, or by `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`.**
