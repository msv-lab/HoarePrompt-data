Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`. The variables involved here are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `y` is set to the last element in the list `a`, which means `y` is initially equal to `a[-1]`.
   - `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`.
   - `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. Given the range function in Python, the loop will run in reverse order starting from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `y` must be initialized to a value such that the loop can start. Since `y` is initially `a[-1]`, we need to ensure that `a[-1]` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1` for the loop to start.
   - `num_fila` and `max_p` should be correctly set according to their definitions.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

**Final State**:
- `y` must be initialized to a value such that `y >= max_p - 1`.
- `num_fila` must be correctly set to `int(nf[0])`.
- `max_p` must be correctly set to the integer value of `nf[1]`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:

**State: **`y` must be initialized to a value such that `y >= max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`**.
