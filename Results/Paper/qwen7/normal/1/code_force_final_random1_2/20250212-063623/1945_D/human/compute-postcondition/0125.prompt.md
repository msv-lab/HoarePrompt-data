Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `v` is 0, `c` is one more than the previous value of `c`, `pos_final` is one less than the original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from user input, `best` is 10000000000.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total`, `v`, and `na_frente` are such that `v` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, and `best` is updated to the minimum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Otherwise, `v` is greater than `pos_final` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` remains the same if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or remains the same as the original `best`. In the case where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `v` is decreased by 1, `na_frente` remains unchanged, `best` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` remains the same if `v - 1` is greater than `pos_final`. If `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. In both cases, `v` is updated to `v - 1`, and `na_frente`, `best`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
