Output State: **`na_frente` is the value it was before minus 2, `pos_final` is an integer input from the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The variable `pos_final` is decremented by 1, so its new value is the original value minus 1. The other variables (`na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged.
