Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ `na_frente` < 10^4, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs accumulated from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` lists, `v` is 0, `c` is `c` (one more than the previous value of `c`), `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The value of `na_frente` is decremented by 1. Since `na_frente` was initially an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4, after decrementing by 1, its new range will be 0 ≤ `na_frente` < 10^4. The values of `total`, `v`, `c`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
