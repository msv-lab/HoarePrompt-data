Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. The variables involved here are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `v` and `na_frente`**:
   - From the given information, `v` is currently set to 0.
   - We need to determine the initial value of `na_frente`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `na_frente` down to -1, decrementing by 1 each time.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `na_frente` is less than 0, the loop will not run at all.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `v` is already set to 0, no adjustment is needed for `v`.
   - We need to ensure that `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `na_frente` and `v`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `v` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0**
