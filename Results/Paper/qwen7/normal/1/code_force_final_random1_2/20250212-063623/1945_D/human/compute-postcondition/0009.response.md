Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `v` which ranges from `na_frente` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. Therefore, the variables involved are `v`, `na_frente`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `v`**: The loop starts with `v` being equal to `na_frente`. Since `na_frente` is one less than its original value, we need to set `v` to this initial value.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Given the range specified, the loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `na_frente` is an integer and typically non-negative (as it is derived from an input integer), this condition is generally satisfied.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start and execute correctly. This means setting `v` to `na_frente` and ensuring `na_frente` is valid.

Given these points, the adjusted states are:

- `v` should be set to `na_frente`.
- `na_frente` should be valid (non-negative).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be a non-negative integer, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `best` is 10, `v` is `na_frente`**
