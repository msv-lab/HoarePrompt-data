Postcondition: `total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` is unchanged if it is greater than the respective total value after considering whether to `trocar_a[v]` or `passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the same conditions apply without changing `best`.
