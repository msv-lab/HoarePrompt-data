Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `y` will be `0`, `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`, `b` will remain an empty list, `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration, and `custo` will be the final sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, with `a_values` being a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `y` will be set to `0`, indicating that the loop has finished. The values of `max_p`, `num_fila`, `b`, `b_values`, and `custos` will retain their values from the last iteration or initial state (if not modified within the loop). The variable `custo` will hold the total cost calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` based on the given condition throughout all iterations.
