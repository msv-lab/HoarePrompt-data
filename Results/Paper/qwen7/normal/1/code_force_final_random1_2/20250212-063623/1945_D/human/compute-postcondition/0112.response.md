Postcondition: **`total` remains the same if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or remains the same as the original `best`. In the case where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `v` is decreased by 1, `na_frente` remains unchanged, `best` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged.**
