Output State: The loop will continue to iterate until `y` becomes less than `max_p - 1`. After all iterations, `y` will be less than `max_p - 1`, meaning it will eventually exit the loop. At this point, `custo` will hold the sum of the values of `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration where `a_values[y]` is compared against `b_values[y]`. The value of `y` will be `max_p - num_fila - 1`, as it starts from `num_fila - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration. The lists `b`, `b_values`, and `a_values` will remain unchanged from their initial states.

In summary, `custo` will contain the cumulative sum based on the comparison of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each iteration, `y` will be `max_p - num_fila - 1`, and `b`, `b_values`, and `a_values` will retain their initial values.
