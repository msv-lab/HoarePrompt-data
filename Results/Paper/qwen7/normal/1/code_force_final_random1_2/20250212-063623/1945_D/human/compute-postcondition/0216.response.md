Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, the value of `a_values[y - 1]` plus `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]` plus `a_values[0]`, and the current value of `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[0]` adds the value of `a_values[0]` to `custo`. Given the initial conditions, `custo` was increased by `b_values[y]` and `y` is 1. Therefore, `custo` is now increased by both `b_values[y]` and `a_values[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
