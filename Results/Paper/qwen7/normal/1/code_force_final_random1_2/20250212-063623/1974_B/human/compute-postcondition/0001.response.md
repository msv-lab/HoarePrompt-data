Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is len(unique_chars) - 1**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `i` and `j`. `i` is assigned the value 0, and `j` is assigned the value `len(unique_chars) - 1`. The length of `unique_chars` remains unchanged, and it still contains the unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically.
