Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 0, `j` is either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`, `char` is either the first character in the original string `s` or inserted into `unique_chars` at index 0, and `s` is modified such that if `char` is in `unique_chars`, the first character of `s` is replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`; otherwise, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`.
