Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, the first character of `s` is replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`. Otherwise, `i` is updated to 2 or 3, `j` is updated to `len(unique_chars) + 1` or `len(unique_chars) + 2`, and `unique_chars` is updated to include `char` at the appropriate position, with `j` incremented by 1.
