Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars)`, the first character of `s` is replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, and `char` is the next character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` was either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1`, it now becomes either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
