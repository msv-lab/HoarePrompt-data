Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires decoding an encoded string back to its original form. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1` to decode the string.
   - It first extracts unique characters from the encoded string `s` and sorts them alphabetically to create `unique_chars`.
   - Then it iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is found in `unique_chars`, it replaces it with the corresponding symmetric character from `unique_chars`.
   - If the character is not found in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character into `unique_chars` at the appropriate position and adjusts `j` accordingly.

3. **Issues in the Given Code**:
   - The logic for replacing characters is flawed. Instead of replacing characters with their symmetric counterparts, the code simply replaces them with the current character in `unique_chars` without considering the symmetry.
   - The insertion logic for characters not in `unique_chars` is also incorrect. It should maintain the order of characters and their positions correctly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly decode, we need to map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - We can achieve this by maintaining a dictionary that maps each character to its symmetric counterpart.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Therefore, the provided implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
