Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically.**

Explanation: The code creates a set of unique characters from the string `s` and then sorts this set alphabetically. The set operation `{char for char in s}` removes duplicate characters, and the `sorted` function arranges these unique characters in alphabetical order. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
