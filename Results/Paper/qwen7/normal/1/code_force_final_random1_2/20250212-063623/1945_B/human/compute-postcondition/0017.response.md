Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer from input.
   - `b` is the second integer from input.
   - `m` is the third integer from input.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `t`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `m` is the third integer from input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`**.
