Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the postcondition remains as initially described. Otherwise, `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is 1.
