Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is the first integer from input.
   - `b` is the second integer from input.
   - `m` is the third integer from input.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mn`**:
   - `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - Therefore, `mn = min(a, b) + m`.

4. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Substituting `mn` with `min(a, b) + m`, we get `(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1`.

5. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - Let's assume without loss of generality that `a <= b` (the case where `b <= a` would yield the same result due to symmetry).
   - Then `min(a, b) = a`.
   - So, `mn = a + m`.
   - The expression becomes `(a + m) // a + (a + m) // b + 1`.
   - This simplifies to `1 + (m // a) + 1 + (a // b) + 1` (since `a // a = 1` and `m // a` and `a // b` are integer divisions).

6. **Final Simplified Expression**:
   - The expression further simplifies to `3 + (m // a) + (a // b)`.

Given this, the output will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, but the form of the output is clear.

Output: **3 + (m // a) + (a // b) (where `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, and `m` is the third integer from input)**
