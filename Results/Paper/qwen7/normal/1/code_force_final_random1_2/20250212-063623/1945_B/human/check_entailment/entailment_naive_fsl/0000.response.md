Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `mn` and the subsequent division operations do not account for the correct overlap of firework visibility periods.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `6 7 4`

According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and the second installation every 7 minutes. Each firework is visible for 5 minutes. The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches and then calculating the number of overlapping intervals.

However, the current implementation calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is incorrect. This calculation does not account for the periodic nature of the launches and the visibility period of the fireworks.

A correct solution would involve finding the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many intervals fit within the visibility period `m`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = (m + lcm - 1) // lcm
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected version uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches and correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
