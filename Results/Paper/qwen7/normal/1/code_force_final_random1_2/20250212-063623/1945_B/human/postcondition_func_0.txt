The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where for each test case, it takes three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (each between 1 and \(10^{18}\)). It calculates the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) plus \(m\) and then computes either \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} + 1\) or \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b}\) depending on whether \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1. The function outputs these calculated values for each test case. After processing all test cases, it returns no value explicitly but ensures all inputs are processed and the corresponding calculations are performed.
