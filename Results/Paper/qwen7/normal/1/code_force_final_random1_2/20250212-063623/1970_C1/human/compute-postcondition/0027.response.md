Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop().pop()`, `one` is `False`, and `lst[tmp]` is not empty**

Explanation: The variable `one` is initially set to `True`. The line `one = not one` changes its value to `False`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
