Output State: **`z` is an input integer; `tmp` is equal to the last element of `lst[tmp]` after all elements have been popped from `lst[tmp]`; `one` is `False`; `two` is `True`.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `two`. This does not affect the values of `z`, `tmp`, or `one`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and `two` is updated to `True`.
