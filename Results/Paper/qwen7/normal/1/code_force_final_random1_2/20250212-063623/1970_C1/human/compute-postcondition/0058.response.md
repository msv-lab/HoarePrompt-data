Output State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`; `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`**.

This means that the `visited` set has been updated to include the `neighbor` node, while the other conditions and values remain unchanged.
