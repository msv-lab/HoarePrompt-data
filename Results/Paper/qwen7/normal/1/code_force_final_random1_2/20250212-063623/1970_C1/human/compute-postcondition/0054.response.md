Output State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now includes this new tuple, while the other conditions remain unchanged. The `tree[current]` still contains at least one element, `neighbor` is still added to `visited`, and the current value of `neighbor` is still not in `visited`.
