Output State: **`x` must be greater than 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the value of `a` appended to a list, `lst[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to the list `lst[a]`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `lst[a]`. Given that `lst[a]` initially contained the value `b`, after appending `b` again, `lst[a]` now contains both the original value of `b` and the new value of `b` (which is the same as the second input integer). All other variables remain unchanged.
