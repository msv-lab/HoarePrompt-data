Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `x` is greater than the total number of iterations (n), `a` and `b` remain as series of input integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration, `lst` and `rev` defaultdicts remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `z = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `z`. It does not affect the values of `x`, `a`, `b`, `lst`, and `rev`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions described in the initial state.
