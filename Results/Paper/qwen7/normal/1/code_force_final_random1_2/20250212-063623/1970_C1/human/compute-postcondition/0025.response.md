Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop().pop()`, `one` is `True`, and `lst[tmp]` is not empty**

Explanation: The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` pops an element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. Since `tmp` was already equal to `lst[z].pop()`, now `tmp` is updated to the new value popped from `lst[lst[z].pop()]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
