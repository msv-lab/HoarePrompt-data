Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the value of `a`, `lst[a]` now contains the value `b`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `lst`. Since `a` and `b` are both input integers, the list `lst` at index `a` will now contain the value `b`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
