Output State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`, and `visited` now includes the element neighbor, `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

This means that the `neighbor` node has been added to the `visited` set, while keeping the other conditions intact.
