Output State: **The program returns -1**

In this scenario, the initial state indicates that the `queue` is empty, meaning all nodes have been processed, and the `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree, indicating the entire tree has been traversed. The code snippet provided simply returns `-1`. Since no other information is provided about the shortest path distance or any other variables, the only information we have for the return value is that it is `-1`.
