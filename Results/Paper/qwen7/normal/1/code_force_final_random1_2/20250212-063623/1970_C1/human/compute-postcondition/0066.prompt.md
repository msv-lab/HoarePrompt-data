Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `queue` is not empty. If `current` (which was the first element of `queue` before calling `popleft`) is equal to `target`, the function returns the second element of the list `queue` (which was initially `dist` before calling `popleft`). If `current` is not equal to `target`, the function does not return anything as there is no else part in the code.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`; `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`, and `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
