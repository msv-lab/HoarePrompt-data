Output State: The `queue` is empty, and the `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree. The `dist` value associated with the target node (one of the two leaves) is returned as the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `queue` will be empty because all nodes have been processed. The `visited` set will contain every node in the tree, indicating that the entire tree has been traversed. Additionally, the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node (one of the two leaves) will be found and returned.
