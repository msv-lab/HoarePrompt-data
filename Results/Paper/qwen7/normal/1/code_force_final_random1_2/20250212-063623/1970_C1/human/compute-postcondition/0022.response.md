Output State: **`z` is an input integer; `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop()`; `one` is `False`**

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is updated to the result of `lst[tmp].pop()`. This means that `tmp` now holds the popped element from the list at index `tmp` within the list `lst`. The value of `z` remains unchanged, and `one` remains `False`.
