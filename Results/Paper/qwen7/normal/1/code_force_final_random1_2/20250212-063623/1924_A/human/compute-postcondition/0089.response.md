Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is either 0 or 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')), `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 1, so now it is 2. The values of `s`, `cur`, `ans`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged from their initial states.
