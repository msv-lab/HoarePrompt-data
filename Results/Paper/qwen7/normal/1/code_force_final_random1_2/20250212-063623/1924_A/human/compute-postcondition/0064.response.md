Output State: **`tmp` is 'e', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached (1 << k) - 1, `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop plus one more character 'e', and `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The line `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` (which is 'e') to the end of the string `ans`. Since `tmp` is 'e', `ans` gets an additional 'e' appended to it. All other variables (`tmp`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
