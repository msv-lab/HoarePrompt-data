Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `ans` is `ss`.**

Explanation: The code increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Here, `cur_ss` is a value derived from `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. The variable `cur` is updated to its previous value plus `1 << cur_ss`. The other variables `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged.
