Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Bitmask Representation:**
   - The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to keep track of the characters seen so far.
   - Each bit in the bitmask represents whether a particular character (from 'a' to 'a+k-1') has been seen.
   - The bitmask is updated for each character in the string `s`.

3. **Checking All Possible Strings:**
   - The program checks if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It does this by ensuring that the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1` at least `n` times.

4. **Generating the Result:**
   - If all possible strings are found as subsequences, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and generates a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Bitmask Usage:**
   - The bitmask is used to track the presence of characters in `s`, but it doesn't correctly handle the requirement to check all possible strings of length `n`.
   - The bitmask should be used to ensure that every combination of `n` characters is checked, not just the presence of individual characters.

2. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The current logic does not properly check if all combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The bitmask approach is insufficient for this purpose because it only tracks the presence of characters, not their specific sequences.

3. **Generating the Result:**
   - The generation of a non-subsequence string is flawed. It only ensures that one character is missing, but it does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are covered.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
