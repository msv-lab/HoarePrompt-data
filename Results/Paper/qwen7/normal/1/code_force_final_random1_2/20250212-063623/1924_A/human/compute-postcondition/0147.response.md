Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; `cnt` is equal to the original value of `cnt` plus 1; `cur` is 0; `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0. This updates the value of `cur` while keeping all other variables unchanged. The condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` remains true because `cur` is now 0, and any number ANDed with 0 results in 0.
