Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string that has been fully processed.
- `cur` is reset to 0.
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\).
- `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
- `tmp` is an empty string.
- `ans` is appended with `tmp`.

Given these conditions, the value of `ans` is determined as follows:
- `s` is concatenated with itself three times.
- This result is then followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
- Finally, `ans` is appended with `tmp`, but since `tmp` is an empty string, this does not change the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is:
\[ \text{s} + \text{s} + \text{s} + \text{'a'}^{(n - cnt - 1)} \]

Output: **s + s + s + 'a'^(n - cnt - 1)**
