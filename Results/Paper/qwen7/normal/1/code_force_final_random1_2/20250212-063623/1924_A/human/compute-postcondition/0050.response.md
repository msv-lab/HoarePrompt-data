Output State: **`tmp` is 'a', `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `tmp`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the given code snippet, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
