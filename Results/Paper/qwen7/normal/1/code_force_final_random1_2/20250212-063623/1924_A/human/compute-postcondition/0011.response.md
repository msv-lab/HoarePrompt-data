Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is an integer where the current value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is `1`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Given the initial condition that `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is `0`, after adding `1 << cur_ss` to `cur`, the new value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` will be `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
