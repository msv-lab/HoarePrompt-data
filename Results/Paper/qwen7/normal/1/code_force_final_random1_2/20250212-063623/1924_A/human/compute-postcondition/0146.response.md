Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; `cnt` is equal to the original value of `cnt` plus 1; `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` equals 0; `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) for some integer \(k\).**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `s` remains a non-empty string, `cur_ss` retains its initial value (difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'), and the condition involving `cur` and `cur_ss` also remains true.
