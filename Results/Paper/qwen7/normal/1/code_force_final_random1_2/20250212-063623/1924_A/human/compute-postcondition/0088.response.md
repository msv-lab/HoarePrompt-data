Postcondition: `s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is either 0 or 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')), `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'. If the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true, then `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')).
