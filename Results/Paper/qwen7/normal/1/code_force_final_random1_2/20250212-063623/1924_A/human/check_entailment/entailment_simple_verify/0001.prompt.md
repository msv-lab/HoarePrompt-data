You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is equal to the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), and `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself `t` times. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself `t` times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Bitmask Representation:**
   - The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to keep track of the characters seen so far.
   - Each bit in the bitmask represents whether a particular character (from 'a' to 'a+k-1') has been seen.
   - The bitmask is updated for each character in the string `s`.

3. **Checking All Possible Strings:**
   - The program checks if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It does this by ensuring that the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1` at least `n` times.

4. **Generating the Result:**
   - If all possible strings are found as subsequences, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and generates a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Bitmask Usage:**
   - The bitmask is used to track the presence of characters in `s`, but it doesn't correctly handle the requirement to check all possible strings of length `n`.
   - The bitmask should be used to ensure that every combination of `n` characters is checked, not just the presence of individual characters.

2. **Logic for Checking Subsequences:**
   - The current logic does not properly check if all combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The bitmask approach is insufficient for this purpose because it only tracks the presence of characters, not their specific sequences.

3. **Generating the Result:**
   - The generation of a non-subsequence string is flawed. It only ensures that one character is missing, but it does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are covered.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
