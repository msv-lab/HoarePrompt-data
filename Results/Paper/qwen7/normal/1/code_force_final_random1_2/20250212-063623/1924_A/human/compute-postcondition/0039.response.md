Postcondition: `cur` is updated to either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, and `cur_ss` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains as `(1 << k) - 1`.
