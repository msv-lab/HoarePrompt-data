Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`**.

Explanation: The code increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Here, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. Since the initial condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to 0, it means that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0. After executing `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` will now be set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
