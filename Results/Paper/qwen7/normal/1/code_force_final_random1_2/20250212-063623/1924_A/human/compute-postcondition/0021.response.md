Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `ss` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop does not change the values of `cur`, `cnt`, or `ans` unless `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`. In that case, `cur` is reset to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is set to `ss`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `ss` is updated to the next character in the string `s`.
   - The variables `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is met.

Given the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`
- `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`
- `cnt` is `cnt + 1`
- `ans` is `ss`

Since the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, the variables `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` were updated accordingly.

For the next iteration:
- `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` will be `ord(next_ss) - ord('a')` where `next_ss` is the next character in `s`.
- `cur` remains `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cnt` remains `cnt + 1`.
- `ans` remains `ss`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(next_ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `ans` is `ss`**
