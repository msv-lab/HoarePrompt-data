Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`. This part is correct.

2. **Subsequence Check Logic**:
   - The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the characters seen so far.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask and checks if all `k` characters have been seen (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`).
   - If all `k` characters are seen, it increments the count (`cnt`) and resets the bitmask (`cur`).
   - The variable `ans` is built by appending characters to it whenever the bitmask indicates that all `k` characters have been seen.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - If `cnt` (the number of times all `k` characters were seen) is at least `n`, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `tmp` representing a missing character (if any) and appends `a` enough times to make the string of length `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where not all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.
   - It ensures that the constructed string `ans` is of length `n` and uses only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

5. **Final State**:
   - The final state of the program matches the expected behavior: it either prints "YES" or "NO" followed by a string of length `n` if applicable.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
