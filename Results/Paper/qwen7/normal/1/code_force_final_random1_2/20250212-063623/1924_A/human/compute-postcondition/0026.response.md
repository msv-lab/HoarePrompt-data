Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated to either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 to `cnt + 1`, and `ans` is `ss`.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously incremented to `cnt + 1`, now it is incremented again by 1, making it `cnt + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
