Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `s` is the string input by the user, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `ans` is `ss`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is set to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is set to `ss`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is updated to either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is `ss`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is concatenated with `ss`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is updated to either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, and `cur_ss` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0, or remains as `(1 << k) - 1` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
