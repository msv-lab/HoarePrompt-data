Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string with its first character removed, `cur` is incremented by \(1 << cur_ss\) if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is met and `cur` is not equal to \(2^k - 1\); otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is equal to the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains 1, `ans` remains `ans + ss`, and `cur_ss` remains the same as the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
