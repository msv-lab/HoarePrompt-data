Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), `tmp` is "b", `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns to `tmp` the character whose ASCII value is `ord('a') + i`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing this line, `i` is incremented to 2. Therefore, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `ord('a') + 2`, which is 'b'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
