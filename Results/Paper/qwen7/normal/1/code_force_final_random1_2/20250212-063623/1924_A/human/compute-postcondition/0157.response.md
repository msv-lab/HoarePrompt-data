Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, `cur_ss` remains unchanged.**

The code `ans += ss` adds the value of `ss` to `ans`. Since `ss` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `ans` is now the concatenation of its previous value and `ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.
