Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is `ss` + `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the current character `ss` to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` was `ss + ss`, so after adding `ss` again, `ans` becomes `ss + ss + ss`. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ss`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
