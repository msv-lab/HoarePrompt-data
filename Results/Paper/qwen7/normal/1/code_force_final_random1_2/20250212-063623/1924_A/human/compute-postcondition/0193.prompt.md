Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), and `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times, `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `k` is a positive integer. If the current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` equals 0, then `tmp` is 'b' and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, and if `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `tmp` set to 'b'. If `cur & 1 << i` does not equal 0, the same conditions apply without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, and if `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition does not change if the condition is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
