Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of the string `s` and the ASCII value of the character 'a'. This difference is stored in the variable `cur_ss`. The initial state of `s` as a non-empty string remains unchanged.
