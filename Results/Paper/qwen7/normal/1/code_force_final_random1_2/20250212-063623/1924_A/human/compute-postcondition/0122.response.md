Output State: **`tmp` is 'j', `cur` remains 0, `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`, `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `i` is 5**.

Explanation: The code changes the value of `tmp` to the character whose ASCII value is `ord('a') + i`. Since `i` is 5, `tmp` becomes `'j'`. The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur_ss`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
