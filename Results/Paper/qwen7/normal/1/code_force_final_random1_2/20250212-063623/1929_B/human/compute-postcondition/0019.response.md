Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `ceil` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
2. The expression `k / 2` computes half of `k`.
3. `ceil(k / 2)` then takes the ceiling of this result, rounding it up to the nearest integer if necessary.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ceil(k / 2)`. However, we know that `k` is an integer, so `k / 2` will either be an integer or a floating-point number.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
