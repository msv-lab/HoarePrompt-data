Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer converted to an integer.
- `k` is an input integer converted to an integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here, `k` is an integer, and the expression `k // 2 + 1` computes the floor division of `k` by 2 and then adds 1 to the result. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

So, the output will be the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the input integer)**
