Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three values: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers within specific ranges. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` as inputs through its processing logic, with `t` being a count of test cases, and for each test case, it checks the conditions on `n` and `k` to determine the output.
