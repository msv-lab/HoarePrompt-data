Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k <= 4 * n - 4:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    elif k == 4 * n - 3:
        print(2 * n - 1)
    elif k == 4 * n - 2:
        print(2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is an element from the list of lines read from standard input excluding the first line, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. After executing the if-else block, `k` is either less than or equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 4, or `k` is either equal to 4 * n - 3 or within the range of 4 * n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the next line from the standard input, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the condition is met. Otherwise, if `k` equals `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, the condition is also met. In all other cases, the values of `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `s` is the next line from the standard input. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` are modified according to the if part. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
