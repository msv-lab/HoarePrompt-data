Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, the output is `k // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, the output is `ceil(k / 2)`. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, and for each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` will be as they were provided during the respective iteration. The loop will have processed all inputs up to the original value of `t`, printing either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)` based on the condition `4 * n - 2 == k`.
