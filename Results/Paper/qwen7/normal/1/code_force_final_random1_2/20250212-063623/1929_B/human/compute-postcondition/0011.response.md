Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
