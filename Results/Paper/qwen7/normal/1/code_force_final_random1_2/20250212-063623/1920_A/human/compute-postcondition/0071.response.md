Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `num`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: 
   - `num` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `num`.
   - `count_num` is incremented if the current value of `i` is within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive.
   - If `i` is outside the range, `count_num` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `num`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `num`.
   - `num` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num` must still have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in `num`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is the next element in `num` and `num` must still have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**
