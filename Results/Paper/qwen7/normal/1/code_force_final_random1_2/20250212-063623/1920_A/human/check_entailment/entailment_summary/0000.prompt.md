Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns an integer input provided by the user. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space`, a boolean, and `to_int`, which can be either a string or a list of strings. If `space` is True, it splits the input string `to_int` by spaces and converts each item to an integer, returning a list of integers. If `space` is False, it splits the input string `to_int` into a list of characters. In both cases, the function modifies the input string `to_int` by splitting it into a list (`items`), and it returns a list of integers or characters based on the value of `space`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym` representing a separator. It concatenates all elements in `arr`, converting each element to a string and separating them with `sym`. The resulting string is returned, and the last element of `arr` is stored in `i`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a string and a non-empty substring as inputs. It returns a list containing all the starting positions where the substring appears within the string. If no more occurrences of the substring are found, it returns a list of all previously found positions and an index value of -1.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It searches through the list `arr` and returns a list of indices where the integer `element` is found. If `element` is not found in `arr`, an empty list is returned.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function searches through a list of lists (`arr`), where each sublist contains exactly two integers representing a constraint (a, x). It compares the element at a specified index (`index`) within each sublist to a given value (`value`). If it finds a sublist where the element at the specified index matches the given value, it returns that sublist. If no matching sublist is found, it returns a list with one fewer sublist, ensuring that all remaining sublists have elements at the specified index not equal to the given value. If no sublists remain, it returns `None`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    if start > end:
        return 0
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function processes a series of constraints and a list of integers. It identifies the minimum value (`start`) from constraints of type 1 and the maximum value (`end`) from constraints of type 2. It then counts how many integers in the provided list (`num`) fall within the range `[start, end]`. If the range is invalid (i.e., `start` is greater than `end`), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the difference between the range size (`end - start + 1`) and the count of integers within the range, returning 0 if this difference is non-positive.
