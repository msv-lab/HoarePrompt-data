Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `end` is equal to `v`, and if `start` is less than `v`, then `start` remains unchanged.**

This means that the variable `end` has been assigned the value of `v`. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `v`, and `start`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
