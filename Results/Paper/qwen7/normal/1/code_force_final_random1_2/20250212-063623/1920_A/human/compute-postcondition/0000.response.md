Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique; `n` is updated to the integer input value.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The constraints on `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the condition that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique, also remains valid. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
