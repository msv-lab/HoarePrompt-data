Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from input, `v` will be the second last integer from input, `num` will be a list containing all integers from input where `t` was 3, and `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1, or it will remain unchanged if no such `v` exists; `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2, or it will remain unchanged if no such `v` exists.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variables `t` and `v` will hold the values from the last input provided during the loop's execution. The list `num` will contain all the integers that were input when `t` was 3. The variable `start` will be updated to the smallest value of `v` where `t` was 1, and `end` will be updated to the largest value of `v` where `t` was 2, unless no such values existed, in which case `start` and `end` will retain their initial values.
