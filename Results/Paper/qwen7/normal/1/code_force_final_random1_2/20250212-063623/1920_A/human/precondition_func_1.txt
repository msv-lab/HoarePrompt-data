t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and for each test case, the input consists of n lines, where each line contains two integers a and x (1 ≤ a ≤ 3, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), representing the type of constraint and the value of the constraint respectively.
