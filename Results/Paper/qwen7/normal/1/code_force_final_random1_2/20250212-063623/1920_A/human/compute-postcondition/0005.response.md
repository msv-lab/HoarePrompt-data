Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `t` and `v`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The input values for `t` and `v` are not specified, so they are referred to as "an input integer" without a specific number.
