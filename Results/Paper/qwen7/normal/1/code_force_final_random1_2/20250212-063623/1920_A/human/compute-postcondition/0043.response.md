Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from input, `start` is `v`, and if `t` does not equal 2, `end` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. If `t` was equal to 2, `end` would remain unchanged, but since the code does not modify `end`, it stays as per its initial condition.
