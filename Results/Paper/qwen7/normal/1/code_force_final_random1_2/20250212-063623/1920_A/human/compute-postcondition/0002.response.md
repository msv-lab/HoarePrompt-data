Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and updated to the integer input value, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0.**

The code simply assigns the value `1000000000.0` to the variable `end`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `x`, or `start`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
