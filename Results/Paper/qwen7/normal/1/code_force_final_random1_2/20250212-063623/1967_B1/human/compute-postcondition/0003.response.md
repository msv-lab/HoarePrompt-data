Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `count` is 2.**

The code initializes the variable `count` to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
