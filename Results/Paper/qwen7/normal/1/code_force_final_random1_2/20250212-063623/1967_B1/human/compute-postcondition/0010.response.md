Output State: **`countmins` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Given the initial conditions, the values of `countmins`, `count`, `ans`, and `g` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement it was in.
