Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be at least 2, `i` is `t`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block. All the variables retain their initial states, including `g` being less than `countmins`.
