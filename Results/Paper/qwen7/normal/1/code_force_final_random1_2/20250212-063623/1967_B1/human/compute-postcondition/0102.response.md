Postcondition: `count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, `ans` is `n` + (int(`n` / 2) / 2) + 1 + int(`n` // 3 / 3) + 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `t + 1, `g` is updated to int(`n` / 5), and either `g` is less than `countmins` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `g` is not less than `countmins` and no change occurs to the variables.
