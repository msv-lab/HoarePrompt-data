Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

This means that `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, and since it is specified that `t` must be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4 (inclusive), the updated state reflects this constraint. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
