Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions**: The program attempts to count valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the logic inside the loop does not accurately reflect this condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The program tries to calculate `g = int(n / count)` and then uses it in the subsequent calculations without properly computing the greatest common divisor (GCD).

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the `while` loop does not correctly iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` to check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
- For each pair, compute the GCD of `a` and `b`.
- Check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
