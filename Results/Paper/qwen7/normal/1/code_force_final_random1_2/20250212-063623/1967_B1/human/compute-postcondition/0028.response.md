Output State: **`count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4)`, `ans` is `ans + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within the scope of the `break` statement, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
