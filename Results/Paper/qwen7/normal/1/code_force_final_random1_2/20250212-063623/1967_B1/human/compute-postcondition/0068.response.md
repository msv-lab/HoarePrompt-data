Output State: **`count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is 1**.

Explanation: Initially, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, and `g` is an integer value equal to `n // 4`. The code `g -= countmins` subtracts `countmins` from `g`. Since `countmins` is 3, `g` becomes `n // 4 - 3`. Given that `g` was initially an integer value equal to `n // 4`, after the subtraction, `g` becomes 1. The values of `count` and `countmins` remain unchanged.
