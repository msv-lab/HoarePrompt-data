Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be at least 2, `i` is `t`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1. Therefore, `g` becomes `int(n / 2) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
