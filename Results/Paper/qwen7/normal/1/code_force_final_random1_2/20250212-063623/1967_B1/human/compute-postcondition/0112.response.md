Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on \( n \) and the number of iterations up to \( m \). Specifically, it iteratively updates a running total starting from \( n \), adding a calculated increment in each iteration until the specified limit \( m \) is reached. The final printed value represents the sum of the initial \( n \) and all the increments calculated during the iterations.**
