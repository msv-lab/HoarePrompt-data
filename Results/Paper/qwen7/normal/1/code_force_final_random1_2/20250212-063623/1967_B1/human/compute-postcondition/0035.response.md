Output State: `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated in each iteration, and `m` must be less than or equal to the value of `t`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `count` will be one more than the initial value of `m`. The variable `countmins` will be `m - 1`. The variable `g` will be calculated as `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`. The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the cumulative sum of the increments made in each iteration of the loop. This cumulative sum is determined by the logic inside the loop, which adjusts `ans` based on the values of `n`, `count`, and `countmins` during each iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `g` must be greater than or equal to `countmins`, and this continues until `count` reaches `m + 1`.
