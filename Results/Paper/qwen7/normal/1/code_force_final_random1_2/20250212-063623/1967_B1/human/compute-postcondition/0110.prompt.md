Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = int(count - 1)
        g = int(n / count)
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += int(g / count) + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated in each iteration, and `m` must be less than or equal to the value of `t`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `count` will be one more than the initial value of `m`. The variable `countmins` will be `m - 1`. The variable `g` will be calculated as `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`. The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the cumulative sum of the increments made in each iteration of the loop. This cumulative sum is determined by the logic inside the loop, which adjusts `ans` based on the values of `n`, `count`, and `countmins` during each iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `g` must be greater than or equal to `countmins`, and this continues until `count` reaches `m + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is 0, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(1 / 5) + 1`, `m` must be at least 5, `i` is `t`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `count` until it reaches `m + 1`. After the loop completes, `count` will be `m + 1`. Since the condition `g < countmins` is checked inside the loop and `g` is reduced by `countmins` each iteration, eventually `g` will become 0. The value of `ans` accumulates with each iteration, starting from `n` and adding `int(g / count) + 1` each time. After 3 iterations, `ans` has already been updated to `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(1 / 5) + 1`. Since `g` becomes 0, no further additions will occur, so `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `count` is `m`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated from the loop iterations, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `t + 1, `g` is the final value calculated based on the last iteration.

To understand this output state, let's break it down:

- The loop continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Once `count` reaches `m`, the loop terminates.
- During each iteration, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
- `g` is updated based on the division of `n` by `count` and subtracting `countmins`.
- If `g` becomes less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus one.
- This process repeats until `count` equals `m`.

After all iterations, `count` will be equal to `m`, `countmins` will be `m - 1`, and `ans` will be the accumulated sum of all increments calculated during the loop iterations. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, and the final value of `g`) will retain their state from the last iteration or the initial conditions provided.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
