Output State: **`count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated in each iteration, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m`. However, the initial values of `count`, `countmins`, `g`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Additionally, the initial value of `i` is `t`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described in the output state.
