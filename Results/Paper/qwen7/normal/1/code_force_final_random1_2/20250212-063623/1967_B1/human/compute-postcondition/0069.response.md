Output State: **`count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is 1, `ans` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ans += int(g / count) + 1` updates the value of `ans`. Given the initial state where `count` is 4 and `g` is 1, the expression `int(g / count) + 1` evaluates to `int(1 / 4) + 1`, which is `0 + 1` (since integer division truncates the decimal part), resulting in 1. Therefore, `ans` is updated to its current value plus 1, making `ans` equal to 2. The values of `count`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged.
