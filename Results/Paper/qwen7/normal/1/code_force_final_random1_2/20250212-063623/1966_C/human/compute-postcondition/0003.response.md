Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0.**

Explanation: 
- The code first takes a space-separated string of integers as input.
- It converts each element of the input string into an integer and creates a set to remove duplicates.
- The set is then converted back into a list and sorted in descending order.
- Finally, the number 0 is appended to the list.
- The variable `tc` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
