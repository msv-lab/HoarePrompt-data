Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is at least 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, the difference between consecutive elements will be at least 1. Therefore, the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` will always be `False`. As a result, `dp` will be set to `not dp`. The values of `tc`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
