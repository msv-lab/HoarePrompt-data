Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the value of `int(input())`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `arr` is updated to be sorted and unique integers in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation: The line `dp = True` sets the variable `dp` to `True`. All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0 is also maintained.
