Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `tc` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `i` is equal to the length of the list `arr`.
   - `dp` is set to `True` if the difference between the last two elements of the list (considering the list ends with 0) is greater than 1, or it is the negation of its previous value if the difference is not greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `dp`**:
   - Since `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, let's denote the length of `arr` as `L`.
   - The last element of `arr` is `arr[L-1]` and the second last element is `arr[L-2]`.
   - `dp` is `True` if `arr[L-1] - arr[L-2] > 1` or `False` otherwise.

4. **Possible Scenarios for `dp`**:
   - If `arr[L-1] - arr[L-2] > 1`, then `dp` is `True`.
   - If `arr[L-1] - arr[L-2] <= 1`, then `dp` is `not dp`.

5. **Output Determination**:
   - The print statement will output `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True`.
   - The print statement will output `'Bob'` if `dp` is `False`.

Given the initial conditions and the logic for setting `dp`, the value of `dp` depends on the last two elements of the list `arr`. However, without the actual values of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact boolean value of `dp`. Therefore, the output will depend on the relationship between the last two elements of `arr`.

Output: **'Alice' if arr[L-1] - arr[L-2] > 1 else 'Bob'**
