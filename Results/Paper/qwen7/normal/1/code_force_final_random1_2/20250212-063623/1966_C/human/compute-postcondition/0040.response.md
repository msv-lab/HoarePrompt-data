Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n)` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `dp` is `arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not dp`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = n + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `n + 1` and must still satisfy `i < n`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the condition `i < n` will be false, meaning the loop will not execute again.

6. **Final state**: Given the loop will not execute again because `i` is now `n + 1` and the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied, we need to ensure that the state reflects this.

However, since the loop will not execute again, the state of `dp` does not change, and the state of `tc` remains the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `dp` is `arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not dp`**
