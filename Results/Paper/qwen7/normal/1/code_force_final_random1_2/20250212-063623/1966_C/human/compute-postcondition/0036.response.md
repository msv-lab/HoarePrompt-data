Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, where `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
   - `dp` is True.
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.

4. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, `i` must decrease from `n` to `1` during the loop execution.
   - `n` remains constant as it is derived from the length of `arr` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be able to start at `n` and decrement to `1`. Therefore, `i` should be `n` initially.
   - `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start.

6. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least `1`.
   - `i` must be `n`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n`**.
