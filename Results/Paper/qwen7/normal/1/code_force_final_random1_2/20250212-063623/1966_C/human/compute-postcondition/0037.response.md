Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Here, `i` is set to `n` initially, so after the code execution, `i` becomes `n - 1`. The value of `dp` is determined by evaluating the condition with the current values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. The preconditions for `tc` and `n` remain unchanged.
