Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the array `A` is precomputed and reused for each test case, which leads to incorrect results for different values of `n`. 

The precomputed array `A` is generated up to 200,000, but the problem statement specifies that the input `n` can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which means the precomputed array is sufficient. However, the issue lies in how the precomputed sums are used.

For each test case, the program directly accesses `A[n - 1]`, which gives the sum of the numbers after digit sum transformation for all numbers from 1 to `n`. This approach works for small values of `n`, but it fails to handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 10, because the precomputed array starts from index 1 (i.e., `A[0]` is not defined).

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- For `n = 1`, the correct sum should be `1` (since the digit sum of 1 is 1).
- Using the precomputed array, `A[0]` is not defined, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 10 correctly, making it incorrect.
