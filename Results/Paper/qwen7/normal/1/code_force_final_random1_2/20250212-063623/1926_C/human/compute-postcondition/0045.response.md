Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. The function does not return a value explicitly but processes the given integers t and n for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers: `t` and `n`. It processes these integers according to their specified ranges without returning any explicit value from the function itself.
