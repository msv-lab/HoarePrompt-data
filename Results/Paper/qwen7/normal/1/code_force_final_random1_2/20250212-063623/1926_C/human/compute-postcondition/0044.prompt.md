Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is "400000"; `pd['400000']` is the sum of the digits from 1 to 400000; `pd['400001']` is the sum of the digits of `pd['400000']`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will eventually reach "400000" and then continue to "400001". The loop processes each number from 1 to 400000, adding the integer value of each digit to the corresponding `pd` index. By the end of the loop, `pd['400000']` will contain the sum of all digits from 1 to 400000. Then, `pd['400001']` will be updated to the sum of the digits of `pd['400000']`. All other values in `pd` will remain as they were updated during the loop iterations, but the focus here is on the final values of `i` and `pd['400000']` and `pd['400001']`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(pd[n])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `pd` is the same as before the loop, `pd['400000']` is the sum of the digits from 1 to 400000, `pd['400001']` is the sum of the digits of `pd['400000']; `n` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `pd` is the same as before the loop, `pd['400000']` is the sum of the digits from 1 to 400000, `pd['400001']` is the sum of the digits of `pd['400000']`, `n` is an input integer, `n` is an integer input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `pd` is the same as before the loop, `pd['400000']` is the sum of the digits from 1 to 400000, `pd['400001']` is the sum of the digits of `pd['400000']`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `n` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
