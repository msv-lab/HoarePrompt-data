Output State: **`pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400003, and `pd[400003]` is `pd[400002] + int(j)`**.

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`. Initially, `i` is set to 400002. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 400003. The value of `pd[400003]` is updated to be the current value of `pd[400002]` plus the integer value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
