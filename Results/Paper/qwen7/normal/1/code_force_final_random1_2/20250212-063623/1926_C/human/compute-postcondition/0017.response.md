Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in str(i):` statement. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. In each iteration, `pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `pd[i]` has been increased by the value of `int(j)`. This implies that `j` was the last character processed in the string representation of `i`.

4. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the string representation of `i` to process. This means `i` should still have characters left to iterate over.

5. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` is being iterated over as a string, the next character `j` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`. Therefore, `i` should be reduced by one character to reflect the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` should be the string `i` without its last character.
- `j` will be the next character in the string representation of the new `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can represent it as `i[:-1]` (all characters of `i` except the last one).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`, `i` is the string `i` without its last character, `j` is the next character in the string representation of the new `i`**
