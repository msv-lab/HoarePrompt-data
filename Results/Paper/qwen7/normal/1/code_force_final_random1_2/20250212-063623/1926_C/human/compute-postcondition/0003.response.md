Output State: **`a` is `num % 10`, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 20000, and `num` is reduced by a factor of 10.**

Explanation: The code divides `num` by 10 and converts the result back to an integer, effectively removing the last digit of `num`. Since `a` was initially defined as `num % 10`, its value remains unchanged. The new value of `num` is now a positive integer between 1 and 20000 (inclusive), but without its last digit.
