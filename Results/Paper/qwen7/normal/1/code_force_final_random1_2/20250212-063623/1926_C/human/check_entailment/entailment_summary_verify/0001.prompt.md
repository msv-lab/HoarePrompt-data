You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5 and calculates the sum of its digits. It then returns this sum. However, if the initial value of `num` is 0, the function returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Pre-calculation:**
   ```python
   A = []
   sum = 0
   for i in range(1, 200001):
       a = func_1(i)
       sum = sum + a
       A.append(sum)
   ```
   - This loop calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sums in list `A`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the sum of digits of a number.
   - However, this pre-computation is unnecessary and inefficient since it recalculates the same values multiple times for different test cases.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   ```python
   for t in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       print(A[n - 1])
   ```
   - This part reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by printing the pre-calculated cumulative sum at index `n-1`.

3. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(num):
       a = 0
       while num != 0:
           a = a + num % 10
           num = int(num / 10)
       return a
   ```
   - This function correctly computes the sum of digits of a given number.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Unnecessary Pre-calculation:**
   - The program pre-calculates the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in `A`. This is not necessary because the sum of digits can be computed directly for each test case without storing intermediate results.
   
2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The pre-calculation step has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) where \(n = 200,000\). For each test case, the program still needs to access an element in `A`, which is efficient but not optimal.
   - Given the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, this approach might exceed the time limit for large inputs.

3. **Efficient Solution:**
   - A more efficient solution would be to directly calculate the sum of digits for each number in each test case without pre-calculation.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary pre-calculation and potential time complexity issues. A more efficient approach would be to directly compute the sum of digits for each number in each test case.
