Output State: **`pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`, `i` is the string `i` without its last character, `j` is the first character of the updated `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. It also modifies the string `i` by removing its last character and assigns the first character of the updated `i` to `j`. Therefore, these changes are reflected in the output state.
