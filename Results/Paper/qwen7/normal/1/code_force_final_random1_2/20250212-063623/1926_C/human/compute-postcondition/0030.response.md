Output State: **`pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400004, `pd[400004]` is `pd[400003] + 4`, `pd[i]` is `pd[i] + int(j)`**

The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`. However, since the value of `j` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `pd[i]`. We only know that `pd[i]` (which is `pd[400004]`) will be increased by the integer value of `j`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
