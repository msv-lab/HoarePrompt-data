Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` which is iterated over the string representation of `i`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`.
   - `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits.
   - `i` is 400003.
   - `pd[400003]` is `pd[400002] + int(j)`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is used to generate the string `str(i)`, and `j` is an element of this string, the next value of `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 400004.
   - The string `str(i)` will now be "400004".
   - The variable `j` will be the first character of this string, which is '4'.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `pd['400001']` remains unchanged as it was derived from `pd['400000']` and does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
   - `pd['400000']` remains unchanged for the same reason.
   - `i` is now 400004.
   - `pd[400004]` will be `pd[400003] + int('4')`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400004, and `pd[400004]` is `pd[400003] + 4`**
