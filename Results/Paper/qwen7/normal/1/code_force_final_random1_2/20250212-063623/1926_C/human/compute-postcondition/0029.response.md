Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` which is iterating over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: 
   - `pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`.
   - `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits.
   - `i` is 400004.
   - `pd[400004]` is `pd[400003] + 4`.
   - `pd[i]` is `pd[i] + int(j)`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - For each iteration, `j` takes on the value of each digit in `i`.
   - `pd[i]` is updated by adding the integer value of `j`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 400004, the string representation of `i` is "400004".
   - The first character `j` will be '4'.
   - After the first iteration, `pd[400004]` will be updated to `pd[400003] + 4`.
   - The next character `j` will be '0'.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains 400004 because the loop is iterating over the digits of `i`.
   - `pd[i]` will be updated to include the next digit '0'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now '0'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400004, `pd[400004]` is `pd[400003] + 4`, `pd[i]` is `pd[i] + int('0')`**
