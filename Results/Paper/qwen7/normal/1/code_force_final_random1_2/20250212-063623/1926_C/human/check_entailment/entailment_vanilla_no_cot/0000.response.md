Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Pre-computation**: The program precomputes the sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is unnecessary and inefficient because the precomputed values are not reused across different test cases. Each test case should independently compute the required sum without relying on precomputed values.

2. **Time Limit**: Given the constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, precomputing sums up to 200,000 is not feasible. The program would take too long to execute due to the large number of computations involved.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop where the actual computation for each test case should be performed. Instead, the program directly accesses the precomputed list `A`, which is incorrect.

4. **List Initialization**: The list `A` is initialized but not used correctly. It accumulates sums incorrectly and is not reset between test cases.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a += num % 10
        num //= 10
    return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_sum += func_1(i)
    print(current_sum)
```

This corrected version avoids precomputation and directly computes the required sum for each test case efficiently.
