Output State: **`a` is `2 * (num // 10) % 10`, `num` is now `num // 10`**

Explanation: The value of `num` is divided by 10 and then converted to an integer, which means `num` is now `num // 10`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was initially calculated as `2 * num % 10` and does not depend on the new value of `num` directly. Therefore, `a` is updated to be `2 * (num // 10) % 10`.
