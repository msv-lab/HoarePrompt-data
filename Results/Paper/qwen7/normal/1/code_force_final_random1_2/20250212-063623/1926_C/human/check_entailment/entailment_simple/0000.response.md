### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It initializes `a` to 0 and iteratively adds the last digit of `num` to `a` using the modulus operator (`%`), then removes the last digit by integer division by 10 (`//`).
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0, ensuring that all digits have been summed.
   - The function returns the correct sum of the digits.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program initializes two lists `A` and `sum` but does not use them effectively.
   - It pre-calculates the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in list `A`.
   - For each test case, it reads the input `n` and prints the corresponding sum from list `A` (i.e., `A[n-1]`).

3. **Efficiency Issue**:
   - The main program pre-computes the sums for all numbers up to 200,000, which is unnecessary for each test case.
   - Instead, it should compute the sum of the digits for each number in the range specified by the test case directly.
   - However, the problem statement specifies a time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, and the current approach would exceed this limit for large values of `t`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - Despite the inefficiency, the logic for calculating the sum of digits is correct.
   - The main program's logic for handling multiple test cases is also correct, although it can be optimized.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct but inefficient. It computes the sum of digits for all numbers up to 200,000, which is unnecessary and would exceed the time limit for large `t`.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**

**Explanation**: While the `func_1` function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, the main program is inefficient and would exceed the time limit for large values of `t`. The program should compute the sum of digits for each number in the range specified by the test case directly, rather than pre-computing for all numbers up to 200,000.
