Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `L`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain as the first and second input values respectively. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `L` and retains the initial values of `n` and `k`.
