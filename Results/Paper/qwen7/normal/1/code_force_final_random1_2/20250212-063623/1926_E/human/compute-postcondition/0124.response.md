Output State: `a` is 2, `L` is [], `pow` is 8, `tot` is 6.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `L` is empty. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue with `a` being 2, `L` becoming [], `pow` being 4 (doubled from the previous iteration), and `tot` being 4 (from the last iteration). The loop then checks the condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a`, prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` which is `4 * (2 * (k - 4) - 1)`, and updates `tot` to `tot + a` which is `4 + 2 = 6`. Since `L` is now empty, the loop terminates.
