Output State: **`tot` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `a` is an integer; `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `pow`, it is simply stated that `pow` is multiplied by 2. The values of `tot`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
