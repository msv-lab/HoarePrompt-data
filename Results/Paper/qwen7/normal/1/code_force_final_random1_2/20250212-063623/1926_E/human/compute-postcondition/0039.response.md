Output State: All variables will retain their final values from the 3rd iteration, with `pow` being `pow * 2 * 2 * 2`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `L`. Given that `L` contains three elements `[1, 1, 1]`, the loop will execute exactly three times. After each iteration, `tot` increases by the value of `a`, and `pow` is multiplied by 2. By the end of the third iteration, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, which is `3`, and `pow` will be `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`. Therefore, all variables will retain their values from the end of the third iteration, with `pow` being `8`.
