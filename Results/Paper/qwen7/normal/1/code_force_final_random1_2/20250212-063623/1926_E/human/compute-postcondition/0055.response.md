Output State: **`n` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing two elements both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by `m`, which is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be greater than 1 initially, the new value of `n` will be `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged.
