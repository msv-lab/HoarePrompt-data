Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `m` is (n + 1) // 2, `n` is (n - (n + 1) // 2)**

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` from `n`. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`. The other variables (`a`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
