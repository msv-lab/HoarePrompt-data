Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values but does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case to perform some operation or validation based on the values of t, n, and k, though the specific operation is not detailed here.
