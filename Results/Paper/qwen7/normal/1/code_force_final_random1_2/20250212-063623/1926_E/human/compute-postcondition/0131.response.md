Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n \), it computes a specific mathematical expression involving powers of 2 and the difference between \( k \) and a cumulative sum. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.**
