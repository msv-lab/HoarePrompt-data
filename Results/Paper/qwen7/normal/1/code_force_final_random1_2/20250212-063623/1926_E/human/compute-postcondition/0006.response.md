Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is already defined before the operation, we can express the new value of `n` as `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
