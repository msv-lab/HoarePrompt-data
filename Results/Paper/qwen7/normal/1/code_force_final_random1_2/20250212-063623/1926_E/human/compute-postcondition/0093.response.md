Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 3], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `m` is 3, `n` is 0**

Explanation:
- Initially, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Given `n` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, substituting `n` with its expression, we get `n = (n - 3) // 2`. Solving this, we find `n` is 0 when `n` is 0 initially.
- `m` is then calculated as `(0 + 1) // 2`, which equals 0.
- The list `L` is appended with `m`, so `L` becomes `[1, 3]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `pow`, `tot`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
