Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

2. **Determine the current state of `n`**: The problem states that `n` is an input integer. Before the loop, `n` is an input integer, but we don't know its exact value. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero.

3. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since the loop requires `n` to be non-zero, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero. If `n` were zero, the loop would not execute even once.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer**
