Output State: **`n` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing three elements all equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Initially, `L` contains two elements, both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. After appending `m` (which is also equal to `(n + 1) // 2`), `L` now contains three elements, each equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
