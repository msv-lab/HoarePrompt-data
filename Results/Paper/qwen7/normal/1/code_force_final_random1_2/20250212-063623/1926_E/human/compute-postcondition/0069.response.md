Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. This means the loop variable `a` takes values from the list `L`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is [1, 1, 1]
   - `pow` is 2

3. **Determine the next value of `a`**: Since `a` iterates over the list `L`, the next value of `a` will be the next element in the list `L`. Given that `a` was 1 in the previous iteration, the next value of `a` will be the second element in the list `L`, which is also 1.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `a` must be a valid value from the list `L`. Since `L` is [1, 1, 1] and `a` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `L` that match the current value of `a`.

5. **Adjust the state**: After the next iteration, `a` will be set to the next value in the list `L`. Since the list `L` is [1, 1, 1], the next value of `a` will still be 1. The list `L` remains unchanged, and `pow` remains 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1], `pow` is 2**
