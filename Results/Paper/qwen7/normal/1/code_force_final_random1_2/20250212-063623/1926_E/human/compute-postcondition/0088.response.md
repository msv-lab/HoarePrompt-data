Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The code `n -= m` subtracts `m` from `n`. Since `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, substituting `m` into the equation gives `n -= (n + 1) // 2`.
- After the subtraction, the new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The value of `m` remains unchanged as the assignment operation does not affect its value directly.
