Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing [1, 1, 1], `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `tot` to 0. The loop runs as long as `n` is non-zero. In each iteration, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, and the value of `(n + 1) // 2` is appended to the list `L`. Since `n` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `n > 0`, the loop does not execute. Therefore, `n` remains 0, `k` remains unchanged, `L` contains three elements all equal to 1, and `tot` remains 0.
