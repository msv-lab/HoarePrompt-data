Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1, 3, 2], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. From the given information, we can see that after the first 3 iterations, `n` becomes 0. This means the loop has completed its execution. Therefore, the final output state remains the same as after the third iteration: `a` is still 1, `L` contains the list `[1, 3, 2]`, `pow` is still 2, and `tot` is still 3. The values of `m` and `n` are not part of the final output state since they are temporary variables used within the loop.
