Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is now the integer value entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in `tot` being the sum of all elements in the list `L` (which is 3), `k` remaining unchanged as an integer, `a` being the last integer in the list `L` (which is 1), and `pow` being multiplied by 2 three times (resulting in `pow` equal to 8).

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `tot` will be 3 (the sum of all elements in the list `L`), `k` will remain as an unchanged integer, `a` will be the last integer in the list `L` which is 1, and `pow` will be 8 since it gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `a` remains 1 because it is the only element in the list `L`. The list `L` itself does not change during the loop. The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop, but since the loop only iterates 3 times, `pow` becomes 2 (2^3 / 2^2 = 2). The variable `tot` is updated in each iteration by adding the value of `a`, so after 3 iterations, `tot` is 2 + 1 = 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is 2, `L` is [], `pow` is 8, `tot` is 6.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `L` is empty. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue with `a` being 2, `L` becoming [], `pow` being 4 (doubled from the previous iteration), and `tot` being 4 (from the last iteration). The loop then checks the condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a`, prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` which is `4 * (2 * (k - 4) - 1)`, and updates `tot` to `tot + a` which is `4 + 2 = 6`. Since `L` is now empty, the loop terminates.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
