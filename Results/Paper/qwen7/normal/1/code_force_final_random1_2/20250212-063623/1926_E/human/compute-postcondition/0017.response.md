Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing [1, 1, 1].

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. During each iteration, `m` is set to `(n + 1) // 2` and then `n` is reduced by `m`. The value of `m` is always 1 when `n` is 1, which causes `n` to become 0. Since the loop appends `m` to the list `L` in each iteration, and `m` is 1 for the last few iterations, `L` will contain three 1s.
