Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a positive integer (though its specific value is not needed to determine the output).
- `s` is an input string (though its content is not specified, we need to focus on the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' within it).
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The code snippet `print(x + y)` will print the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Since the exact content of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `x + y`. However, we know that `x` and `y` represent counts of specific substrings in `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
