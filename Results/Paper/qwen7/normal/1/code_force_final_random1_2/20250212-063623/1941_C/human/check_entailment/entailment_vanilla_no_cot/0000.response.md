Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to traverse the string and keep track of whether we have encountered "map" or "pie". If we encounter either, we skip the necessary characters to avoid the substring and count the deletions accordingly.
