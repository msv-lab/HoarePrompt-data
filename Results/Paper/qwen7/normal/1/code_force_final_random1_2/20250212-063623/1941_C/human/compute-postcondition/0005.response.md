Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The code snippet `print(x + y)` will print the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
