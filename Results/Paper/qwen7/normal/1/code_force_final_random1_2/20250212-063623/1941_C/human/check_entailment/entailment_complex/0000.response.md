Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. The program counts the total occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' across all strings in all test cases instead of processing each string individually to find the minimum number of deletions required to make each string beautiful.

The problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make each string beautiful, which means for each string, we need to count how many 'map' and 'pie' substrings exist and then calculate the minimum deletions needed to eliminate them. The current implementation sums up all 'map' and 'pie' occurrences across all strings, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
