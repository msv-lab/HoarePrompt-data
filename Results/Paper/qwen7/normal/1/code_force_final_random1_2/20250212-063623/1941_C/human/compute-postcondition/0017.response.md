Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string from the user.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the new string `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the new string `s`.
- `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`.

The `print(x + y)` statement will add the number of occurrences of 'map' (`x`) and 'pie' (`y`) in the string `s` and then print the result.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string s)**
