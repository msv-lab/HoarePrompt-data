Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, and `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - Since the value of `int(input())` is not specified in the current state, we assume it is a new input value that needs to be greater than 0.

5. **Update the State:**
   - We need to update the state such that the loop condition is satisfied. Therefore, `int(input())` should be a positive integer.

Given this reasoning, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
