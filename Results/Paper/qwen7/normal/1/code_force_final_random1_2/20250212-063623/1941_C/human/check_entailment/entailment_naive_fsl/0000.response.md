Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of deletions required. For example, in the input "mmapnapie", the program would output 2 because it counts both "map" and "pie", but the correct solution is to remove only 2 characters ('m' and 'e') to make the string "mmapnapie" beautiful.
