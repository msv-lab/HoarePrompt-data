The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), a positive integer \( n \), and a string \( s \) of lowercase Latin letters with length \( n \). For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string \( s \), and prints the sum of these counts. The function accumulates these counts across all test cases and outputs the total counts of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences after processing all test cases.
