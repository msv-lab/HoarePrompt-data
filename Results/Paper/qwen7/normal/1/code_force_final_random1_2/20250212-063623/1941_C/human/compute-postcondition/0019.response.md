Output State: The value of `a` is determined by the input for each test case, `s` is the string input for each test case, `x` is the total count of occurrences of 'map' across all strings, and `y` is the total count of occurrences of 'pie' across all strings.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will take on the value of the last input integer provided, `s` will be the last string input. However, since the loop processes each string individually and counts 'map' and 'pie' occurrences separately for each string, `x` and `y` will accumulate the counts of 'map' and 'pie' across all strings processed. Thus, `x` and `y` represent the grand totals of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences respectively, summed up from all the input strings.
