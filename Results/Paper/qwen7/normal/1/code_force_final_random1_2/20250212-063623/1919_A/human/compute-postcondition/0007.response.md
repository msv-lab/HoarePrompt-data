Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `winner`, and `results` remain unchanged except that `a` and `b` now hold the new integer values provided by the user.
