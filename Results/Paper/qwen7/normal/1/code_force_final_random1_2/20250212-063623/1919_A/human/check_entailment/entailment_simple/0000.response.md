### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the winner of the game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have. The key logic is encapsulated in `func_1`, which determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, `func_1` returns 'Alice'.

This logic is based on the observation that:
- If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always force the game into a state where the first player (Alice) will eventually lose.
- If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the game into a state where the second player (Bob) will eventually lose.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to the `results` list.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
