Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `results` is a list containing at least one tuple (or other collection)

The print statement `print(results)` will print the contents of the `results` list. Since `results` contains at least one tuple or other collection, but no specific elements are provided, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **[at least one tuple or other collection]**
