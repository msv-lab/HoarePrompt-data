Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. When `t` becomes 0, the loop will terminate.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `results` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop condition, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Final State**: The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
