Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

In this case, the function `func_1(a, b)` is called with `a` and `b` as arguments, and its return value is assigned to the variable `winner`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, `winner` will hold whatever value `func_1(a, b)` returns. The conditions and values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
