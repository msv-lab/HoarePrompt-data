You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice

    Alice
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers (`a` and `b`) and calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on the inputs. It collects the results of these calls in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, which include the winner for each test case along with the original values of `a` and `b`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately reflect the rules of the game. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` assumes that the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd determines the winner, which is not aligned with the game's rules.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the number of coins in each player's wallet after each move. The key observation is that if the number of coins in either wallet becomes zero, the player whose turn it is loses. Therefore, the player who can force the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves wins.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def determine_winner(a, b):
    # If both wallets have an equal number of coins, the second player (Bob) wins
    if a == b:
        return 'Bob'
    # If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is greater than Bob's, Alice wins
    elif a > b:
        return 'Alice'
    # Otherwise, Bob wins
    else:
        return 'Bob'

def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = determine_winner(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following lines to run the function
# func_2()
```

This corrected logic ensures that the game is played according to the rules described in the problem statement.
