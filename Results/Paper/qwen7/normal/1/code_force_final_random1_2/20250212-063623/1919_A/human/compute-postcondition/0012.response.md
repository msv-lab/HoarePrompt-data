Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a`, and `b`, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer inputs from the user.**

Explanation: The code `winner = func_1(a, b)` updates the value of `winner` to the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`. However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `winner`. The other variables remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` are updated to new integer inputs from the user.
