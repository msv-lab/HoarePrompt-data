Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, the original `a`, and the original `b`, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer inputs from the user, `results` now contains the `winner`, the original `a`, and the original `b`, and the `winner` is added to the list.**

This means that the `results` list now includes the `winner` (which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`), the original value of `a`, and the original value of `b`. Additionally, `a` and `b` have been updated to new integer inputs from the user.
