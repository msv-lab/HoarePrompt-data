Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The key variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged within the loop.
   - `winner` and `results` also remain unchanged within the loop.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `winner` remains the same.
   - `results` remains the same.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`**.
