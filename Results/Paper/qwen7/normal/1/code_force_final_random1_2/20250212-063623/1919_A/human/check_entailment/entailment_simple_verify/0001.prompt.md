You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After each turn, one coin is removed from the current player's wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - On Alice's first turn, she removes one coin, making the total odd.
     - On Bob's turn, he can always swap wallets back to make the total even again.
     - This process continues until there is only one coin left. At that point, the player whose turn it is will be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - If `a + b` is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the total to remain odd after her turn, ensuring she wins.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - This function correctly implements the logic derived from the key insight above.

4. **Main Function Analysis**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
