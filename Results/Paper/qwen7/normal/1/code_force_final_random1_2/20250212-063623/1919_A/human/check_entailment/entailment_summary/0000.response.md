Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have.
- The game rules state that a player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- The key insight here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
- The `func_1` function correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returning the appropriate winner.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b` for each case, and then calling `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.
- Given the execution summaries, both functions work as intended and together they correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
