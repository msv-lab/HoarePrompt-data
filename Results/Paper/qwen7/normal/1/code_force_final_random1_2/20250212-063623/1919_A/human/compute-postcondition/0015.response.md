Output State: `t` is equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the `winner` values from each iteration, the original `a` and `b` values from each iteration, and the `winner` is added to the list after each iteration until `t` becomes 0.

In this final state, `t` has reached 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed, meaning all `t` input integers have been processed. The `results` list contains the `winner` value determined by `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers `(a, b)` entered by the user, along with the original values of `a` and `b` for each iteration.
