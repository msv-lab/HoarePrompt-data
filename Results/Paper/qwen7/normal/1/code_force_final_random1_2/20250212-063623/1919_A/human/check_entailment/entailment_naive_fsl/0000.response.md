Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately reflect the rules of the game. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` assumes that the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd determines the winner, which is not aligned with the game's rules.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the number of coins in each player's wallet after each move. The key observation is that if the number of coins in either wallet becomes zero, the player whose turn it is loses. Therefore, the player who can force the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves wins.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def determine_winner(a, b):
    # If both wallets have an equal number of coins, the second player (Bob) wins
    if a == b:
        return 'Bob'
    # If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is greater than Bob's, Alice wins
    elif a > b:
        return 'Alice'
    # Otherwise, Bob wins
    else:
        return 'Bob'

def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = determine_winner(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following lines to run the function
# func_2()
```

This corrected logic ensures that the game is played according to the rules described in the problem statement.
