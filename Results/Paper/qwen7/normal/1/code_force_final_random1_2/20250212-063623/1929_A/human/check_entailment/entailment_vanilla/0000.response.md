### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in increasing order.
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones. By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest element is paired with the smallest element, which gives us the maximum possible difference.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has only two elements, sorting them will still give the maximum possible difference.
   - If all elements are the same, the beauty will be zero, which is correctly handled by the solution.
   - The solution handles arrays of different sizes and values within the specified constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
