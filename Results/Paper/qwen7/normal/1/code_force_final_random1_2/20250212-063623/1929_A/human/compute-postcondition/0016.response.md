Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ntest` is an input integer.
   - `itest` is `ntest - 1`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
   ```

   This statement calculates the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, the first element of `a` is the smallest integer in the list, and the last element of `a` is the largest integer in the list.
   - The difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `a` will be printed.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the sorted list a**
