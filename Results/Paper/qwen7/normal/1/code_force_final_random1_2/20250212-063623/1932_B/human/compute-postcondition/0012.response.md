Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `year` is the sum of the smallest elements in the original list `a` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The variable `year` accumulates the value of the smallest element from `a` in each iteration. Therefore, `year` will be the sum of the smallest elements from the original list `a` for each of its iterations through the loop.
