Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ai`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.

3. **Consider the given states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `year` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop requires `a` to have at least one element, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `year` is 0**
