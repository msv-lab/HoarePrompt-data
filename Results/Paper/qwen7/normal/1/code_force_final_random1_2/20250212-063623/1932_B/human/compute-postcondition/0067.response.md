Output State: **`n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `current_year` is either `ai` (where `ai` is the first element of `a`) or `ai` updated based on the condition `current_year % ai == 0`, `next_year` is either `2*ai` or `(ai // ai + 1) * ai` depending on the condition, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, and `ai` is the first element of `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation: The line `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to be the same as `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
