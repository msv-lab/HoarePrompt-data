Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `year` is the sum of the smallest elements in the original list `a` for each iteration of the loop.

Given that `a` is initially an empty list, there are no elements to process in the loop. Therefore, the smallest element in `a` for each iteration does not exist, and consequently, `year` remains 0 throughout the loop.

Thus, the print statement will output the value of `year`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
