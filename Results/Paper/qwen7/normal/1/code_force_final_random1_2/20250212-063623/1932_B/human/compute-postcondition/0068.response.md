Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ai in a:`. The variables involved here are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is the value from `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the second value from `test_cases` and must have at least one element.
   - `current_year` is either `ai` (where `ai` is the first element of `a`) or `ai` updated based on the condition `current_year % ai == 0`.
   - `next_year` is either `2*ai` or `(ai // ai + 1) * ai` depending on the condition.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.
   - `ai` is the first element of `a`.
   - `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the variable `ai` will change in each iteration.
   - The variable `a` remains the same throughout the loop as it is an iterable collection.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ai` will be the next element in `a` after the current iteration.
   - `current_year` will be updated to `next_year` based on the condition in the loop body.
   - `results` will include the updated `current_year` for the current iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the changes in `ai` and `current_year`.

**State:**
- `ai` is now the second element of `a`.
- `current_year` is now equal to `next_year` for the new `ai`.
- `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration.
- `a` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `next_year` is not explicitly mentioned in the state but can be derived based on the condition for the new `ai`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year` for the new `ai`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.**
