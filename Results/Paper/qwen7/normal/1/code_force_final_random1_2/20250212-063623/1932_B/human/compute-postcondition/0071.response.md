Postcondition: **`ai` is now the second element of `a`; `current_year` is updated based on the condition: if `current_year % ai == 0`, then `current_year` is set to `next_year` which is `current_year + ai`; otherwise, `current_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`; `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration; `a` remains the same; `n` remains the same.**
