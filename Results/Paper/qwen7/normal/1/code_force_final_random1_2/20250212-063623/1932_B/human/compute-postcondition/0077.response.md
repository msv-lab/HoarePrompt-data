Postcondition: `ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is either the value of `next_year - ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or the value of `next_year` if it does not satisfy the condition. `results` includes the updated `current_year` or `next_year` for the current iteration, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and if `current_year % ai != 0`, `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
