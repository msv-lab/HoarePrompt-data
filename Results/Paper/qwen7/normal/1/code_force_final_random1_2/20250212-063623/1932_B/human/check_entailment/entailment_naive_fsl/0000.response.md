Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the problem description. For each sign, it waits until the next occurrence after the previous sign has happened. The logic `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that the year is updated to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign's occurrence. This approach works for all given examples and potential cases within the constraints provided.
