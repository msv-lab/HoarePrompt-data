Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ai`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is something for `ai` to iterate over.

3. **Consider the given states**:
   - `year` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on the list `a`, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element.
   - The other variables (`year`, `n`, and `t`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
