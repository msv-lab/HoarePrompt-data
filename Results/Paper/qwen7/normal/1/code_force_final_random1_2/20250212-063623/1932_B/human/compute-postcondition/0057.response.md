Output State: **`n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases`, `current_year` is the final value after processing the next element in `test_cases` according to the given logic, `next_year` is equal to `current_year`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first value of the tuple `test` to `n` and the second value to `a`. The values of `current_year`, `next_year`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous states.
