Output State: **All test cases in `test_cases` have been processed, and `results` contains the final value of `current_year` for each test case.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `results` list will contain the final value of `current_year` for each test case described in `test_cases`. The loop processes each test case individually, updating `current_year` based on the logic provided, and appends the final value to the `results` list. Since all test cases have been processed, `results` will now hold the outcome for every single test case, with no further changes to any variables outside the loop.
