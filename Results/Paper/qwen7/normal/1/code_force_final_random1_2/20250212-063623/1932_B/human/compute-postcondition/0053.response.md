Output State: The final value of `current_year` will be the same as `next_year` after all iterations of the loop have finished. This value will be the smallest multiple of any element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` for each iteration, starting from the initial `current_year` of 0. Since `current_year` starts at 0, the loop will find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of any element in `a`. Therefore, `current_year` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `current_year` will hold the smallest number that is divisible by every element in `a`.
