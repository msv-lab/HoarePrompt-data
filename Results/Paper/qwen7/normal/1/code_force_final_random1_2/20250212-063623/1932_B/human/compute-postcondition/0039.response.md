To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `year` starts with an initial value of 0.
2. **Iterative Update**: For each element `ai` in the list `a`, the value of `year` is updated according to the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.

Let's assume the list `a` is `[2, 3, 5]` for illustration purposes (since the actual list `a` is not provided, we'll use this example to demonstrate the process).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **First Iteration (ai = 2)**:
   - Initial `year` = 0
   - `year % 2` = 0 % 2 = 0
   - `year += 0 or 2` = 0 + 2 = 2
   - New `year` = 2

2. **Second Iteration (ai = 3)**:
   - Current `year` = 2
   - `year % 3` = 2 % 3 = 2
   - `year += 2 or 3` = 2 + 2 = 4
   - New `year` = 4

3. **Third Iteration (ai = 5)**:
   - Current `year` = 4
   - `year % 5` = 4 % 5 = 4
   - `year += 4 or 5` = 4 + 4 = 8
   - New `year` = 8

After processing all elements in the list `a`, the final value of `year` is 8.

### Final Output:
Output: **8**
