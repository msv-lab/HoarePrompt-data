Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `ai`.
   - The loop iterates over the list `a`.
   - The other variables mentioned are `current_year`, `results`, `a`, `n`, and the reassignment of `current_year` to `next_year`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - `ai` is taken from the list `a`.
   - `current_year` is updated based on the condition:
     - If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `current_year` is set to `next_year` which is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, `current_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration.
   - `a` and `n` remain the same.
   - `current_year` is reassigned to `next_year`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` is the second element of `a`.
   - `current_year` is updated based on the condition and reassigned to `next_year`.
   - `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration.
   - `a` and `n` remain the same.
   - For the next iteration, `ai` will be the third element of `a` (since it was the second element in the previous iteration).

Given this information, let's update the states:

- `ai` will be the third element of `a`.
- `current_year` will be the value it was reassigned to in the previous iteration, which is `next_year`.
- `results` will include the updated `current_year` for the current iteration.
- `a` and `n` remain the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is the value of `next_year`, `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same**.
