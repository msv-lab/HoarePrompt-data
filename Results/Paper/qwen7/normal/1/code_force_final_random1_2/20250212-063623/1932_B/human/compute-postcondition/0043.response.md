Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^6). It then iteratively updates a variable `year` starting from 0, using the formula `year += year % ai or ai` for each integer `ai` in the list. After processing all integers in the list for all test cases, it prints the final value of `year` for each test case.**
