Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `year` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `year`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the precondition remains unchanged except for the new value of `year`.
