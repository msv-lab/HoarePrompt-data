Output State: **`idx` is equal to `2 * n + 7`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `results` contains 'NO', `n` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `q` is the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is updated to {(0): [0]}, `t` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `idx` is set to `n + 7 + n`, which simplifies to `2 * n + 7`. This value remains unchanged.
- `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `results` remains as a list containing 'NO'.
- `n` is updated to the value of `int(data[idx])`, where `idx` is `2 * n + 7`.
- `q` is updated to the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, where `idx + 1` is `2 * n + 8`.
- `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, which is `n`.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, which is `q`.
- `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, where `pf[l - 1]` is `pf[n - 1]`.
- `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, which is `mp.get(pf[q], [])`.
- `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, which is `mp.get(pf[n - 1], [])`.
- `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` (which is `n`) in the sorted list `v1`.
- `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, where `r` is `q`.
- `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `mp` is updated to `{(0): [0]}`.
