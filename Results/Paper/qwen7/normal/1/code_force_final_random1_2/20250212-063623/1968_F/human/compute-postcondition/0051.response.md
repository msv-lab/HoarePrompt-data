Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now either an empty list or a list containing 'YES', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`**.

Explanation: The code `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` retrieves the value associated with `pf[r]` from the dictionary `mp`. If `pf[r]` exists in `mp`, `v1` is assigned the corresponding value. If `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, `v1` is assigned an empty list `[]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
