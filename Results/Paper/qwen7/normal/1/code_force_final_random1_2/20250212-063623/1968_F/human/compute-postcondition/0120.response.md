Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 5`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`, `mp[pf[i + 1]]` is an empty list, and `mp[pf[i]]` does not contain `[k + 1]` anymore.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` clears the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Previously, `mp[pf[i]]` contained the list `[k + 1]`. After executing this line, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
