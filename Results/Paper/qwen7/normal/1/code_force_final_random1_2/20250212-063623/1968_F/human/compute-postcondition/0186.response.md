Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 1.

3. **Determine the value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Hence, `n` must be a non-negative integer.

4. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `results`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They remain unchanged or are initialized outside the loop.

Based on this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer**
