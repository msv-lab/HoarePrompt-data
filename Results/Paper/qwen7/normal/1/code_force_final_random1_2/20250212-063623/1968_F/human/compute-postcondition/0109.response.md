Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - `pf[i]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be the last value it was set to before the increment.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

5. **Calculate the new values**:
   - If `i` was the last value it had before the increment, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `idx` will be `idx + 1`.

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a[i]` will be the value of `int(data[idx])` for the new `i`.
   - `idx` will be `idx + 1`.
   - `pf[i + 1]` will be `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]`.
   - `pf[i + 1]` will be added to `mp` with an empty list as its value.
   - `mp[pf[i + 1]]` will contain the list `[i + 1]`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a[i + 1]' is now the value of `int(data[idx + 1])', `idx` is `idx + 1`, `pf[i + 1]' is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]' and `pf[i + 1]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, and `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`**.
