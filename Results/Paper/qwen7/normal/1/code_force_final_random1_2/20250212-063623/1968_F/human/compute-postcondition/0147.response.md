Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q, `results` is a list of length q containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`**.

This means that the variable `r` now holds the integer value of the element at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list, while the other variables remain in their previously described states.
