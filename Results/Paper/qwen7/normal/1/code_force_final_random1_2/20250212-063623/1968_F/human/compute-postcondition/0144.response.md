Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `results` list is updated. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `'YES'` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `'NO'` is appended to `results`.**
