Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`.**

Explanation: The code performs a binary search using `bisect.bisect_left` to find the leftmost insertion point for `l` in the list `v1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `it1` depends on the contents of `v1` and the value of `l`, but it is determined by the bisect operation.
