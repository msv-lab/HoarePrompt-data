Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 2, so `idx` becomes `n + 5 + 2`, which simplifies to `n + 7`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
