Postcondition: `idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now ['YES'], `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and if `x` is equal to 0, `results` will contain 'YES'.
