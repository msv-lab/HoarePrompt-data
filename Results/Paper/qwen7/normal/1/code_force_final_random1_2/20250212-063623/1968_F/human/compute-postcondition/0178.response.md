Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends an empty string to the `results` list. Since `results` was previously a list of length `q` with elements 'YES' or 'NO', appending an empty string does not affect the length of the list but adds an additional element, making the total length `q + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
