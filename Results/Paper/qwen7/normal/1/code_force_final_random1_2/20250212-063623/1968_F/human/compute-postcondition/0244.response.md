Output State: **`idx` is now 2 * n + 5, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, `results` is `['YES']`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The `results` list was initially determined based on certain conditions involving `x`, `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, and `v2`. Since those conditions were met, `results` was set to `['YES', 'NO']`.
- After the conditions were checked, the code appended `'YES'` to `results`, changing its value to `['YES']`.
- The rest of the variables (`idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
