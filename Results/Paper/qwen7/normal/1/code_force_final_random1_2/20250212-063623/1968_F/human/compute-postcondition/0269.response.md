Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer t, followed by integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,...,a_n. For each query (l, r) given within a test case, the function determines if the subarray a_l,...,a_r contains a contiguous subsequence with a bitwise XOR of 0. If such a subsequence exists, the function appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for a test case, an empty string is appended to the results. This process repeats for each test case, and the final output is a list of 'YES' and 'NO' values, one for each query, followed by an empty string for each test case.**
