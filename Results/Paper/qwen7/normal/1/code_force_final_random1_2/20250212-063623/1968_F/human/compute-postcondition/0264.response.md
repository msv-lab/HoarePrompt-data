The code appends an empty string to the `results` list. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding value from the `data` list starting from `idx - n` to `idx - 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is computed as the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from the `pf` list and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `a` where that key appears, `results` is a list containing the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and `results` now contains an additional empty string.**
