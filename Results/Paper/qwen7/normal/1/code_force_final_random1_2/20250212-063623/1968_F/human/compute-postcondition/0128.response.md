Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]**'.

Explanation: The line `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. This means that `idx` now points to two indices further in the list `data` compared to its previous position. Since `l` was previously the integer value of `data[idx]` and `r` was the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, after the increment, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` (two positions back from the new `idx`) and `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` (one position back from the new `idx`). The values of `data` and the original `idx` before the increment are unchanged.
