Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,...,a_n. For each query (l, r) given, the function returns information based on the subarray a_l,...,a_r.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test instances. For each instance, it processes a sequence of integers and handles a series of queries on these sequences, returning results based on specified subarrays.
