The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the behavior of `continue` is undefined outside of a loop context. Given the initial state and the fact that the code does not specify a loop, the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2], the current value of `x` is 0, `results` is ['YES']**
