Output State: `idx` is equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n + 1` is `int(data[idx - (i + 1)])` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n + 1` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary containing keys as unique cumulative XOR values of subarrays of `a` and values as lists of starting indices of those subarrays, with the key 0 having the value `[0]` as initially set, and `i` is `n`.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will have incremented to `n + 5` (since it starts at 5 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop which runs from 1 to `n` inclusive), and the lists `a` and `pf` will contain all the integers from `data` starting from `data[5]` up to `data[n+4]`. The dictionary `mp` will contain all unique cumulative XOR values of subarrays of `a` as keys and their starting indices as values, with the initial key 0 having the value `[0]`.
