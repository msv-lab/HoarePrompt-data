Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `data[idx]' converted to an integer; `idx` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial state mentions that `a[i]' is the value of `data[idx]' converted to an integer. Since no other changes are made to `a[i]' or `data[idx]' in the given code snippet, these values remain unchanged except for the increment of `idx`.
