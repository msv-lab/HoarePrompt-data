Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, so the loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`
   - `idx` is `idx + 2`
   - `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`
   - `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]`
   - `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`
   - `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends `i` to the list associated with `pf[i]` in `mp`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n + 1`, so `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `a[i]` will be updated to `int(data[idx])` where `idx` is `idx + 2`.
   - `idx` will be `idx + 2` (since it was `idx + 2` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `pf[i]` will be calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `pf[i + 1]` will be calculated as `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`.
   - `mp[pf[i + 1]]` will contain the list `[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`.
   - `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` will append `i` (which is `k + 1`) to the list associated with `pf[i]` in `mp`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is `idx + 4`
- `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`
- `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`
- `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[k + 2]`
- `mp[pf[i]].append(k + 1)`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`, `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[k + 2]`, and `mp[pf[i]].append(k + 1)`**.
