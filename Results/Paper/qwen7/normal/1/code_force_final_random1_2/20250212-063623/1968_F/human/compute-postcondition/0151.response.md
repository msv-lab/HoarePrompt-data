Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'YES', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since no further operations are specified within the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `idx` is increased by `4 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with one additional 'YES', and `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. The variables `l` and `r` remain undefined.
