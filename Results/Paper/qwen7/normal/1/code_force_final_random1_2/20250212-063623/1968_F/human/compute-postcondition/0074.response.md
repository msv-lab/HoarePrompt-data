Postcondition: **`idx` is equal to `n + 9`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' and possibly other elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]` minus 1, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If certain conditions (it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l) are met, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.**
