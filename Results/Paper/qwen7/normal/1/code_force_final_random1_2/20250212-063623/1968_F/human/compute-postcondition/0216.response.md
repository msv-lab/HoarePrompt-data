Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 2, so its new value is `2 * n + 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `2 * n + 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
