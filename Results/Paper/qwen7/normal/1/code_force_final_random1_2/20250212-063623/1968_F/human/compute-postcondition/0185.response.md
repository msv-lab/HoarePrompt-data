Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q + 2, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', an empty string is appended to `results`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0, `mp` is a dictionary with key 0 and value [0]**.

This means that the dictionary `mp` has been initialized with the key 0 and the value [0], while all other variables remain in their previously stated conditions.
