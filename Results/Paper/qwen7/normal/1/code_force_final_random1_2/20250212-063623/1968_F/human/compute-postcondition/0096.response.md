Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `results` contains 'NO', `n` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `q` is the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**

Explanation: The line `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Given that initially `idx` was equal to `n + 5 + n`, after executing the line, `idx` becomes `n + 7 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
