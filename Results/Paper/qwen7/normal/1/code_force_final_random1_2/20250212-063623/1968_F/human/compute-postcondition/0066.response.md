The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is that the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 9`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and possibly other elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]` minus 1, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `x` is updated to the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` now contains 'YES' and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
