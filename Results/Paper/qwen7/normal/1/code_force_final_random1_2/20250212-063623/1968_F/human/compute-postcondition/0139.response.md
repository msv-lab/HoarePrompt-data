Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` and is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r)` minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r` and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`.**
