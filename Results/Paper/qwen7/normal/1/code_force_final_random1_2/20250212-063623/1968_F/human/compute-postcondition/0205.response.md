Output State: **`i` is 4, `idx` is 5, `a` is a list with an element at index 4 equal to 4, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ 4`, if `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` becomes an empty list, `mp[pf[3]]` contains the value 3**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 4, so after executing this line, `idx` becomes 5. The values of `i`, `a`, `pf[3]`, and `mp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
