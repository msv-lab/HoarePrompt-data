Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n + 1):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 (though `idx` is not part of the loop head).
   - `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`.
   - `mp[pf[2]]` is a list containing `[2]`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration when `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is now 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is a non-negative integer but must be at least 3.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `idx` is increased by 1, so if it was `idx` before, it is now `idx + 1`.
   - `pf[1]` remains as `pf[0] ^ a[1]`.
   - `mp[pf[2]]` remains as a list containing `[2]`.

However, since these variables are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer but must be at least 3**
