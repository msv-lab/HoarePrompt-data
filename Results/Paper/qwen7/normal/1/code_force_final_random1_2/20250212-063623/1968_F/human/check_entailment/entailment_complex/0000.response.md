Reasoning:
1. The program reads input data and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array elements `a_1, ..., a_n`.
3. It then processes each query to check if the subarray from index `l` to `r` is interesting.
4. The program uses prefix XOR (`pf`) to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray.
5. It maintains a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
6. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
7. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting.
8. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a split point within the subarray such that the XOR of both parts is the same.
9. The logic correctly handles the conditions for determining if a subarray is interesting.
10. The program outputs the results for each query and test case as specified.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic and handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
