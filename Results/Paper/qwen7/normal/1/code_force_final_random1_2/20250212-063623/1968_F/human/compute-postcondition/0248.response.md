Output State: **`idx` is now \(2 \times n + 5\), `l` is now the value of `data[2 \times n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, and `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `idx` is \(2 \times n + 5\), and `l` is updated to the value of `data[2 \times n + 1]`. The rest of the variables (`r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `_`) retain their previous values.
