Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 6 (4 * q + 2), `results` is a list of length q + 2 with one additional element 'YES' or 'NO'. `l` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx + 1`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2`. If the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, then `results` has an additional element 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has an additional element 'NO' appended to it.**
