Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[5])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with the second element being `pf[1] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 3, `mp[pf[i]]` is now [3]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[5])` and the fourth element being `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with the second element being `pf[1] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `pf[i]` is now `pf[3] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` is executed, and `mp` now contains the key `pf[i]` with the value `[3, 4]` since `pf[3] ^ int(data[5])` was already a key in `mp` before and its value was an empty list, which is now appended with `4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[i]` is now the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer; `idx` is increased by 1; `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1]` XOR `a[i]`; if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list; `mp[pf[i]]` appends `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
