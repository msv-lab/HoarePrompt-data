Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'YES', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the left side of `v2` starting from -1 up to the position of `r - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Here, `v2` is obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, and `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r)` finds the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted. Subtracting 1 from this position gives the index just before `r` in `v2`. Since `l` and `r` are not defined, they remain undefined. All other variables are updated as per the given operations.
