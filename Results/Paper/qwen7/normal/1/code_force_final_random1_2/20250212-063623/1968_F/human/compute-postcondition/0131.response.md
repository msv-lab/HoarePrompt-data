Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES'**.

This means that the `results` list has been appended with the string `'YES'`, while the other variables (`data`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain in their previously calculated states.
