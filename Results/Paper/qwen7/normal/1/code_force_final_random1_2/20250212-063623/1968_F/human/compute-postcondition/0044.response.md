Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `x` has been assigned the value of `pf[r]` XOR `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or constraints.
