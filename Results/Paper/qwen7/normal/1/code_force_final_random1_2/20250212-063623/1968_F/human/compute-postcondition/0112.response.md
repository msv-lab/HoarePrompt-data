Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` and `pf[i + 1]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, and `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`**

Explanation:
- The line `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`.
- The other conditions (`idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` and `pf[i + 1]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, and `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`) remain unchanged and are still valid after the code execution.
