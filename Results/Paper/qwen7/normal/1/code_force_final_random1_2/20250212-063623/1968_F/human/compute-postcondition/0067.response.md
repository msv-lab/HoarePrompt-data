Postcondition: **`idx` is equal to `n + 9`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and possibly other elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]` minus 1, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `x` is updated to the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and if `x == 0`, `results` now contains 'YES' and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
