Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` and `pf[i + 1]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, and `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given the initial state, `idx` was originally `idx + 1`. After executing the code, `idx` becomes `idx + 2`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
