Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'YES', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the left side of `v2` starting from -1 up to the position of `r - 1`, `results` now contains an additional 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially a list of length `q` containing only elements that are not 'YES', after appending 'YES', its length becomes `q + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
