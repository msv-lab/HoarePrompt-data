Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 5`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`, and `mp[pf[i]]` does not contain `[k + 1]` anymore; `mp[pf[i + 1]]` is an empty list if `pf[i + 1]` is not in `mp`.**

Explanation: The code appends the index `i` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Given the postconditions, `mp[pf[i]]` no longer contains `[k + 1]`, and since `mp[pf[i + 1]]` is specified to be an empty list if `pf[i + 1]` is not already in `mp`, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the other conditions intact.
