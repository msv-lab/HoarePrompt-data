Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 5`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`, `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[k + 2]`, and `mp[pf[i]].append(k + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was `idx + 4`, so after the increment, `idx` becomes `idx + 5`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as no operation directly affects them.
