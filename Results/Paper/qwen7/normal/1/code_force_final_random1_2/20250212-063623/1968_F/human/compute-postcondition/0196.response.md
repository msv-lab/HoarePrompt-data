Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` list has an element at index 3 assigned to `int(data[idx])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(data[idx])` to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is initially 3, the element at index 3 in the list `a` is updated to `int(data[idx])`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` is a non-negative integer but must be at least 3 is still valid, though `n` itself is not directly affected by this operation.
