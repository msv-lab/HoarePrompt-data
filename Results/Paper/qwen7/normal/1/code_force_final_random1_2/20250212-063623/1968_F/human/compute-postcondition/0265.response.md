Output State: `idx` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `t` is decremented by 3, `results` is a list containing the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop for all iterations, and an empty string is appended to `results`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `idx` will be incremented by `2 * (number of iterations)`, which in this case is `2 * n + 1` because the loop iterates over all elements in the data list. The variable `t` is initially decremented by 3 for each full cycle of the loop, so it will be further decremented based on the actual number of iterations performed. The `results` list will contain the outcomes of all the conditions checked during each iteration of the loop, followed by an additional empty string.
