Output State: **`i` is 3; `idx` is 4; `a` is a list with an element at index 3 equal to 4; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ 4`; if `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` becomes an empty list; `mp[pf[3]]` contains the value 3.**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `i` is 3, `mp[pf[3]]` is updated to contain the value 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
