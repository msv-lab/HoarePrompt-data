Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 6 (4 * q + 2), `results` is a list of length q + 1 with one additional element 'YES', `l` is now an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx + 1`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` and `it2` remain unchanged.**

This means that `v1` is updated to the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, while `v2` and `it2` retain their previous values. All other variables remain in the same state as described in the initial state.
