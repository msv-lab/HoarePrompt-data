Output State: **`idx` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to `q`. Given that `idx` is 3, `data[idx + 1]` corresponds to `data[4]`. Therefore, `q` is assigned the integer value from `data[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
