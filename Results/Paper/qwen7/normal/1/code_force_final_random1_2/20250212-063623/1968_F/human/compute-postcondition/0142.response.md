Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1`, `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`, results contains 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`. The only change is that `results` now contains 'NO'. All other conditions and values remain as they were before the code execution.
