Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q, `results` is a list of length q containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx]`**.

This means that the value of `l` is now set to the integer value of the element at the index `idx` in the `data` list, while `idx` has been updated by adding `2 * q` to its original value. The `results` list remains unchanged in terms of its length and contents unless the conditions inside the loop (which are not specified here) have altered it.
