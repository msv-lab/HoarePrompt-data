Output State: `idx` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `t` is decremented by 3, `results` is a list of length `q * 3` containing the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') of the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop, and an empty string is appended to `results`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `idx` will be set to `2 * n + 1`, indicating that all elements in the `data` list up to the current `idx` have been processed. The variable `t` will be reduced by 3 because the loop runs for `t` iterations, and in this case, `t` has completed 3 full iterations. The `results` list will contain the outcomes of the conditions checked in each of the three iterations, followed by an additional empty string.
