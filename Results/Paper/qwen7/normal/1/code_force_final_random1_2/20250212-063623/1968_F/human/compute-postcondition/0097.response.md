Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `results` contains 'NO', `n` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `q` is the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of those variables remain unchanged, and the new list `a` is added to the state.
