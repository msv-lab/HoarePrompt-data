Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer.**

Explanation: The code takes a list of integers from user input, splits the input string into individual elements, and applies a lambda function to each element. The lambda function subtracts the remainder when divided by 2, effectively rounding down to the nearest even number. The resulting list is stored in `p`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not used in the operation.
