Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = \text{previous\_t} - 1\), `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, the input is processed and converted into a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer.**

Explanation: The code takes a space-separated string of integers as input, splits it into individual integers, and then applies the lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2` to each integer. This lambda function subtracts the remainder of the integer divided by 2 from the integer itself, effectively making it the largest even number less than or equal to the original integer. The resulting list of integers (each being the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer) is assigned to `p`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and follows the precondition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = \text{previous\_t} - 1\).
