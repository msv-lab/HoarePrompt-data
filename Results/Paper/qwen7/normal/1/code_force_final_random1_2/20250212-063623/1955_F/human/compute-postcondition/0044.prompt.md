Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a quadruple of non-negative integers (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, and 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cnt is the sum of the floor division of each element in list `a` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `a` is empty, and `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2, after the loop has executed all its iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all elements have been processed, and the variable `cnt` will hold the total sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and the first three elements of `a` must be equal and each must be an odd integer; `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each of the first three elements of `a` by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
