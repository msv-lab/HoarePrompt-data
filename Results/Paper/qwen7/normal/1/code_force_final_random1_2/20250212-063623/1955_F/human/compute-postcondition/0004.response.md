Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer; the input integer is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code first takes a space-separated string of integers as input using `input().split()`. It then maps each integer to the largest even number less than or equal to it using `int(x) - int(x) % 2`. This operation effectively rounds down each integer to the nearest even number. After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `p` is updated to contain the largest even numbers for each input integer. Additionally, the input integer used to generate `p` is decremented by 1.
