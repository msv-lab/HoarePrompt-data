Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(int(input()))`. The variables involved here are:
   - The result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.
   - The loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the value is not needed).

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in list `a` by 2.
   - The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state directly.
   - The number of iterations for the loop is determined by `int(input())`. This means that the loop will run until the input value is exhausted.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state that needs to be adjusted is the number of remaining iterations, which is derived from the input value.
   - After one iteration, the input value is reduced by 1 (assuming it was greater than 0). Therefore, the new state should reflect the updated number of iterations.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- The number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.
- The value of `cnt` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop itself but rather by the initial computation.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in list `a` by 2, and the number of remaining iterations is the input value minus 1**.
