Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the list `a` by 2**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The variable `cnt` is defined based on the initial state, which means it is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2. Since the original list `a` was empty, `cnt` remains as the sum of the floor division of each integer in the new list `a` by 2.
