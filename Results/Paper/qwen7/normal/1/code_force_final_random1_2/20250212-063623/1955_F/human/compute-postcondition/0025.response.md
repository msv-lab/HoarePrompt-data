Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer.
   - `x` is the next integer in the list.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the next `x` by 2, and `cnt` is the new value of `cnt` after adding the floor division of `x` by 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each integer in the list `a`.
   - The variable `x` takes the value of the current integer from the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the list `a` itself does not change within the loop (it remains the same).
   - The variable `x` will take the next integer from the list `a`.
   - The variable `cnt` is updated based on the value of `x` from the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more integer left in the list `a`.
   - The variable `x` will be the next integer in the list `a`.
   - The variable `cnt` will be updated based on the next value of `x`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `a` must still have at least one integer remaining.
   - `x` will be the next integer in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` will be the new value of `cnt` after adding the floor division of the next `x` by 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `x` is the next integer in the list, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the next `x` by 2, and `cnt` is the new value of `cnt` after adding the floor division of `x` by 2**.
