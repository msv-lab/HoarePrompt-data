Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `_` variable in the range function. However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider what changes might occur within the loop that would affect the state.

2. **Understand the loop body implications**: Although the loop body is not provided, we know that the loop processes some input and updates the state of `mex`, `res`, `ar`, `i`, and `n`. Since the loop runs for a number of times specified by the input, we need to determine how these variables change after each iteration.

3. **Determine the final state after the loop completes**: The problem states that after the loop completes, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`. The list `res` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element of `ar`, and `i` will be `-1` indicating the loop has finished executing.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop has already completed, there is no next iteration to prepare for. Therefore, we need to ensure that the final state after the loop is correctly represented.

Given the final state after the loop completes:
- `mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
- `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `i` is `-1` indicating the loop has finished executing.
- `n` is the original input integer.

Since the loop has completed, the state does not need to be adjusted further for another iteration. The final state is the state we need to represent.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `-1`, and `n` is the original input integer.**
