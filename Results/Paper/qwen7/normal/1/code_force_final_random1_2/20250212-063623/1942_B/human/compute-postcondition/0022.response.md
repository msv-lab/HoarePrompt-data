Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in the list `ar`, and `res` will be a list where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`.

In more detail, `mex` starts as `n` and is decreased by each element in `ar` during each iteration of the loop. By the end of the loop, `mex` will be `n - sum(ar)`. The list `res` will contain the value `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
