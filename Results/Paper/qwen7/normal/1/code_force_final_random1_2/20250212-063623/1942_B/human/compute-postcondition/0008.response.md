Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with None, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the last element of the list `ar` (since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mex` is now equal to its previous value minus the last element of `ar`.
