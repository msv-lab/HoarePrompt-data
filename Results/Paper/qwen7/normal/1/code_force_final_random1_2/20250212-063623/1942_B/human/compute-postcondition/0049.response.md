Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
