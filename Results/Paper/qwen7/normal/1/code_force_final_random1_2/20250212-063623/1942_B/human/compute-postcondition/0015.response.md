Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. This holds true whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` is `True` or `False`.
