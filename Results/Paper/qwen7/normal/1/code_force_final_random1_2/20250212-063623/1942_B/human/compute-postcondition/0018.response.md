Output State: **`mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for `i` being `len(ar) - 3`.**

Explanation: The line `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is specified as `len(ar) - 3`, only the value of `res[len(ar) - 3]` is updated according to the rule `res[i] is `mex - ar[i]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
