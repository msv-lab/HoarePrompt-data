Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with None, `mex` is equal to `n` - `ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the `res` list by setting `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Given that `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the specific value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` because `ar[i]` is subtracted from `mex`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or remain unchanged.
