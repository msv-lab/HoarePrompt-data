Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 1 - 1`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` was originally `len(ar) - 1`, after executing the line `i` is decremented by 1, making `i` equal to `len(ar) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
