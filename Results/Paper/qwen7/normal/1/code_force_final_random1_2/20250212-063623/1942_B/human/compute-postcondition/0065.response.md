Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. However, since the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` simplifies to `0 > -ar[i]` or `ar[i] > 0`, and without knowing the specific values of `ar[i]`, we cannot determine if this condition holds true for any specific index `i`. Therefore, the only thing we can definitively say is that the value of `res[i]` might be updated based on the condition, but we cannot specify the exact values of `res` elements without more information about the list `ar`.
