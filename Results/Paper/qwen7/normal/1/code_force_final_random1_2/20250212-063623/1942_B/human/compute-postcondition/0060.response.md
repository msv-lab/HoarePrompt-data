Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` for the current value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` for the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially `len(ar) - 2`, the value of `res[len(ar) - 2]` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
