Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the input value is not specified, the only thing we can definitively say is that `n` now holds an integer value input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
