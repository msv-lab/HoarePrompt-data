Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `-1`, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`.**

Explanation: The line `res = [None] * n` initializes a list `res` of length `n` with all elements set to `None`. This does not change the values of `ar`, `n`, `mex`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
