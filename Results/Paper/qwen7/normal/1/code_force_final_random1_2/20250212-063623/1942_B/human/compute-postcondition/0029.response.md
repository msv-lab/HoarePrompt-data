Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(ar) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `len(ar) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.
   - The variable `len(ar)` should be such that it allows the loop to execute at least once (i.e., `len(ar) - 1 >= -1`).

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state of `i` and ensure that `len(ar)` is valid.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.
- `len(ar)` must be a positive integer (since `len(ar) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `len(ar)` must be a positive integer**
