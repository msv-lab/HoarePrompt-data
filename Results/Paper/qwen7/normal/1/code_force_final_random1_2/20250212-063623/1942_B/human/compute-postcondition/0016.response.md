Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.
- `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse order starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head that changes within the loop is `i`.

### Adjusting the State
- **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to `len(ar) - 2` (since the loop decremented `i`).
- **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will become `len(ar) - 3`.

### New State
- Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to adjust its value.
- All other variables (`n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

### Final State
State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, where `i` is now `len(ar) - 3`.**

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
