Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, and `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given that initially `mex` was equal to `n` and `res[i]` was set to `mex - ar[i]`, the new value of `mex` becomes `n - ar[i]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
