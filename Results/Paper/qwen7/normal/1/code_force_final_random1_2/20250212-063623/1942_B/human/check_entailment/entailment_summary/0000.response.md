Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `ar` in reverse order and calculating the result array `res`. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The program incorrectly updates `mex` without properly ensuring that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `res`.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is redundant and incorrect. It should be checking whether `mex - ar[i]` is a valid value (i.e., it does not already exist in `res`).

3. **Initialization and Update of `mex`**: The program does not correctly initialize and update `mex` to ensure it is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `res`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **False**

A correct solution would involve maintaining a set to track the values already used in the permutation and updating `mex` accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        
        # Initialize mex to n
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Find the smallest non-negative integer not in used
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            
            # Calculate res[i] based on the MEX and ar[i]
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            
            # Mark res[i] as used
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

This corrected version ensures that `mex` is correctly updated and that `res[i]` is calculated based on the correct MEX value.
