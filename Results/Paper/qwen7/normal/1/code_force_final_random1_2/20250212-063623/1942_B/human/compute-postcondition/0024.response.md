Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that the loop runs for a number of iterations determined by the input, which is read using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, the value of `mex` is reduced by the sum of all elements in the list `ar`. Additionally, a new list `res` is constructed where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **End of Loop**: By the end of the loop, `mex` will be `n - sum(ar)`, and `res` will contain the values `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.

4. **State Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the variables that determine whether the loop continues. These variables are the input value (which determines the number of iterations) and the state of `mex` and `res` after the previous iteration.

5. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is the input value used to determine the number of iterations. However, since the input value is not directly modified within the loop, we focus on the internal states (`mex` and `res`) that change with each iteration.

6. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `mex` has been reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar` up to that point, and `res` contains the updated values based on the current `mex`.

7. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` needs to be further reduced by the next element in `ar`, and `res` needs to be updated accordingly.

Given this understanding, let's formulate the state adjustment:

- `mex` will be reduced by the next element in `ar`.
- `res` will be updated to include the new value of `mex - ar[i]` for the next index `i`.

Since the exact values of `ar` and the current state of `mex` and `res` are not provided, we can generalize the state adjustment as follows:

State: **`mex` is reduced by the next element in `ar`, and `res` is updated to include the new value of `mex - ar[i]` for the next index `i`**.

To express this in a specific format:

State: **`mex` is reduced by the next element in `ar`, and `res` is updated to include the new value of `mex - ar[i]` for the next index `i`**.

This captures the necessary adjustments for the loop to continue executing one more time.
