Output State: **`mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` equal to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]` and all other elements as `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` was `len(ar) - 4` before the code execution, now `i` becomes `len(ar) - 3`. The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`, and the value of `res[i]` is also updated to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`.
