Based on the initial state provided:

- `mex` starts as `n` and is reduced by the sum of all elements in the list `ar` after the loop completes.
- `res` is a list where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`.

By the end of the loop:
- `mex` will be `n - sum(ar)`.
- Each element in `res` will be `n - sum(ar) - ar[i]`.

Therefore, when the `print` statement executes, it will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.

Output: **n - sum(ar) - ar[0] n - sum(ar) - ar[1] ... n - sum(ar) - ar[len(ar) - 1]**
