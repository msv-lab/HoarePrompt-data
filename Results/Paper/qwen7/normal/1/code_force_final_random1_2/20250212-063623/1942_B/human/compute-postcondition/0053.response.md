Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`, the initial value of `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Given that `i` starts at `len(ar) - 1`, the loop will always execute as long as `len(ar)` is at least 1.

5. **Adjust the states**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i`.

**State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `n - ar[i]`**
