Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; no other variables are defined.**

This means that `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, while the initial conditions for `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged and are yet to be defined.
