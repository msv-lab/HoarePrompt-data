You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 represents the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 1 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and then decremented to 0, meaning the loop condition `t > 0` will no longer be true. Therefore, the loop will stop executing. At this point, `t` will be 0, which is still within the range of 1 to 1 (inclusive), `n` will be the last input integer received, and `nums` will be the list of integers from the last input string split and converted.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book for each test case. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns the sum of pages for each book in each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
