Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still adheres to the initial condition of being greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
