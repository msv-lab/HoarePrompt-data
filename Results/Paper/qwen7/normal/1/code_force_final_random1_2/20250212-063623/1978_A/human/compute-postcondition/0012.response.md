Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer greater than 0 and between 1 and 498 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `nums[:-1]` creates a new list that contains all elements of `nums` except the last one.
2. `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value in this new list.
3. `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of the original `nums` list.
4. The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the list excluding the last element to the last element of the list.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `n` and the contents of `nums` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]** (where `max(nums[:-1])` is the maximum value in the list `nums` excluding the last element, and `nums[-1]` is the last element of the list `nums`)
