Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `nums`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `n` being an input integer is already given, so no additional information is needed for `n`.
