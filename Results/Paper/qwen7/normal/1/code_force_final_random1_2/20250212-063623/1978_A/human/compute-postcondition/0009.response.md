Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, and `t` is currently greater than 0, we decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` and `nums` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is now `t - 1`, which is still greater than 0 (since it was greater than 0 before and we just decremented it by 1).
- `n` remains the same.
- `nums` remains the same.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**
