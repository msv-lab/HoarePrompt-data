Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
