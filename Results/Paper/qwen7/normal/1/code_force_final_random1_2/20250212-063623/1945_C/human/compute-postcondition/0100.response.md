Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(n/2 - elem)` with respect to `n/2` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `n` is either halved or remains the same depending on whether `n` is even, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `mini` to `10^8`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the value of `mini` is updated to `100000000`, while the rest of the variables retain their previous values and conditions.
