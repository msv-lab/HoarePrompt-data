Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one` is undefined, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50.
