Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n/2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `n % 2 == 0` is true or false, the variables `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, and `pk` will have the same values after the if-else block executes. Specifically, `n` will be divided by 2, `pk` will be set to `n / 2`, and the other variables will retain their respective properties as described.
