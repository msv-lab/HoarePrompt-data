Output State: **`n` is an input integer that is even; `pk` is `n / 2`; `s` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n / 2` assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is an even integer, dividing it by 2 results in an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
