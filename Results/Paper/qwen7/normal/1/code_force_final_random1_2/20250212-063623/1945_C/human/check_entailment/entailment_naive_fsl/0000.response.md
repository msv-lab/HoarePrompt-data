Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side of the road. Specifically, the program uses `zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` to calculate the percentage of satisfied residents, which is incorrect. The correct way to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied is to use the ceiling function to determine the threshold and compare it directly with the counts of zeros and ones.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
010111
```
The program incorrectly calculates the percentages and fails to properly check the conditions for the road placement. The correct approach would involve checking if the number of zeros on the left side is at least `math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and the number of ones on the right side is at least `math.ceil((n - i) / 2)`.
