Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `zero` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other integer). Since it is incremented by 1, its new value is 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The current value of `s[i]` is '0', which is also unaffected by the given code.
