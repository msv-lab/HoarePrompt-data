Output State: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [15, 20]; `final` is [5, 10, 15, 20]; `pk` is `mini` + 20; `elem` is 20.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `lst` will have been modified to exclude elements that were appended to `final`. The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, and if the absolute difference between `pk` (which starts as `mini + elem`) and `elem` equals `mini`, then `elem` is appended to `final`. Given the conditions provided, the loop appends 5, 10, and 15 to `final` and removes them from `lst`. The loop then processes the remaining elements in `lst` (15 and 20), but since `pk` becomes `mini + 15` and `mini + 20` respectively, none of these elements meet the condition to be appended to `final`. Therefore, the final state of `lst` is [15, 20], and `final` contains [5, 10, 15, 20].
