Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`.

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

### Analysis
- The variable `mini` is updated based on the value of `abs(pk - ele)` during each iteration. However, the loop itself does not directly modify `mini`, `pk`, or `lst`. The loop simply iterates through each element in `lst`.
- Since the loop condition is based on the iteration over `lst`, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the value of `ele`.

### State Adjustment
- At the end of the previous iteration, `mini` was updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
- For the next iteration, `ele` will be the next element in the list `lst`.

### Updated State
- The state of `mini` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because it is not modified directly in the loop head.
- The state of `ele` will change to the next element in `lst`.

### Final Answer
State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`**
