Postcondition: `lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `n` is either halved if it is even or remains as `n / 2` if it is odd, `pk` is `n / 2` when `n` is even and `n` itself when `n` is odd, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0, `s` is the input string.
