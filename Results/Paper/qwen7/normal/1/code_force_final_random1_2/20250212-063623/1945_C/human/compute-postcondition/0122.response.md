Output State: **`zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `i + 1`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `zero` is increased by 1, so `zero` is now 2.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which is `2 * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`, so `zero_perc` is `200 // (n - 1)`. Given the example's context, let's assume `n` is at least 2, making `zero_perc` 50.
- `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Initially, `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i] == '0'` is false, so `one` is `o - 1`. Thus, `one_perc` is `(o - (o - 1)) * 100 // (n - (n - 2) - 1)` which simplifies to `1 * 100 // 1` or 100. However, since the condition is not specified to change `one`, we keep it as `o - 1` and `one_perc` as 50.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i] == '0'` is false, so `one` is `o - 1`.
- `lst.append(i + 1)` appends `i + 1` to `lst`, so `lst` contains `i + 1`.
