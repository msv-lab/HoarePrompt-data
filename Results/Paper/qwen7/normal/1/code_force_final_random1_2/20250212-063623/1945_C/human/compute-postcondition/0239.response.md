Output State: **`mini` is 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [15, 20], `final` is [n], `pk` is 25, `elem` is 20, `c1` is undefined**

The code `final.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. However, the value of `n` is not specified in the given code snippet. Since no value is assigned to `n` before this line, `n` remains undefined. Therefore, `final` becomes a list containing `[n]`. All other variables (`mini`, `ele`, `lst`, `pk`, `elem`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.
