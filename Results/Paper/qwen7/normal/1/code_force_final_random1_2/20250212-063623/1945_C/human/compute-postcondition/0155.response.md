Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `lst` is an empty list, `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final`. Since `final` contains elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`, and `lst` is initially an empty list, `final` is also an empty list before sorting. After sorting, `final` remains an empty list but is now sorted. The values of `mini` and `pk` remain unchanged.
