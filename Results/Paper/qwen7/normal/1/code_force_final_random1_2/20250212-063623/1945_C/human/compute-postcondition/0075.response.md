Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk`; `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final`. Since `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk`, and `lst` is initially empty, `final` is also empty. Sorting an empty list does not change its state. Therefore, the only change is that `final` is now sorted, but since it's empty, sorting doesn't affect its content. The values of `lst` and `mini` remain unchanged.
