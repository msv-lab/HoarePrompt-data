Output State: **`zero` is 1 or 0, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2. The value of `zero` is either 1 or 0, so `zero_perc` will be either 50 or 0. The values of `zero` and `i` remain unchanged.
