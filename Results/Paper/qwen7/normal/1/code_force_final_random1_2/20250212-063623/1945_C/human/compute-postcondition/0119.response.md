Postcondition: `zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] == '0'` is false. If the condition `s[i] == '0'` is true, then `one` remains unchanged.
