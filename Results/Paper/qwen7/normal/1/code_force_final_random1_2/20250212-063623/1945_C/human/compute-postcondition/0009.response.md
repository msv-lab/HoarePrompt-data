Output State: **`pk` is `n / 2`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an odd number, `s` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is specified to be an odd number, dividing it by 2 results in a non-integer value. However, the output state only needs to reflect the updated value of `pk` and the unchanged states of `t`, `n`, and `s`.
