Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `lst` is an empty list.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `mini` will hold the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for every `elem` in the original `lst`. The `final` list will contain all elements from the original `lst` that have this minimum distance to `pk`. Since the loop processes each element in `lst` exactly once and then empties `lst`, by the end of the loop, `lst` will be an empty list.
