Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pk` is always `n / 2`. If `n` is even, `pk` is exactly `n / 2`. If `n` is odd, `pk` is still `n / 2`, but note that for odd `n`, `pk` will be a floating-point number that is mathematically equivalent to `n / 2`.
