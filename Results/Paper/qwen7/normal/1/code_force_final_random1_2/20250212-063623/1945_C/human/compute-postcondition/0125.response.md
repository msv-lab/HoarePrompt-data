Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `zero` is 2
- `zero_perc` is 50
- `one_perc` is 50
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `one` is `o - 1`
- `lst` contains `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `one`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `n - 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 2`, the loop will execute one more time because `n - 2 < n - 1`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`. It will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `zero` remains 2 (unchanged)
- `zero_perc` remains 50 (unchanged)
- `one_perc` remains 50 (unchanged)
- `i` will be `n - 1`
- `one` remains `o - 1` (unchanged)
- `lst` remains unchanged because the conditions for `lst` were met in the previous iteration and no new conditions would change it.

### Final State:
State: **`zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `i + 1`**
