Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. The values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `i` are recalculated based on their previous formulas, but since the exact values of `o`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we keep the expressions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc`. The value of `i` is updated to `n - 2` because initially `i` was `n - 1` and `one` was incremented, which might affect the calculation of `one_perc`.
