Postcondition: **`zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is `o - 1`, and `lst` contains `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `one`, and `lst` remain unchanged.**
