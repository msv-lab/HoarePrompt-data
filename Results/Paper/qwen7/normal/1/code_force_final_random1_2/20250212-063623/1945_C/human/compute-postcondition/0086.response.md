Postcondition: `lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` has an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `final` now includes the element `n`.
