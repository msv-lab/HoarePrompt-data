Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` is either undefined or 1, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, and `lst` contains 2, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` but since `one` and `o` are undefined, `one_perc` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, since `one` and `o` are undefined, `one_perc` remains undefined. All other variables retain their initial states.
