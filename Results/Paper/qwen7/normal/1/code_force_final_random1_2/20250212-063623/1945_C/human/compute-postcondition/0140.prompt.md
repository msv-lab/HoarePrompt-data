Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `zero` is 3, `zero_perc` is 30, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 3`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `[i + 1]`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is an empty list, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `n` is either halved or remains the same depending on whether `n` is even, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 3, `one` is `o - 1`, `zero_perc` is 30, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 3`, `lst` contains `[i + 1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
