Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 3, `zero_perc` is 60, `one` is either undefined or 1, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, and `lst` contains 2, 2, `one_perc` remains undefined.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `zero` is either 2 or 1.
- After executing `zero += 1`, `zero` is incremented by 1. Since `zero` was either 2 or 1, it now becomes 3.
- The calculation for `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. With `zero` now being 3 and `i` being 2, `zero_perc` is calculated as `3 * 100 // (2 + 1) = 100 // 3 = 33`.
- However, the problem statement mentions that `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which means it should be recalculated as `3 * 100 // 3 = 100`. But since the problem also states that `zero_perc` is "either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value", and given the context, we can infer that `zero_perc` is 60 (as per typical rounding rules in such contexts).
- All other variables remain unchanged.
