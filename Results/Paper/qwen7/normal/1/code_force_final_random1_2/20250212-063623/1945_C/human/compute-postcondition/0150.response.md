Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - For each element `elem` in `lst`, it updates `mini` and `final`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst` (excluding the first element).
   - `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by the element that makes `mini` the minimum value.
   - `lst` now contains all elements except the first element.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is about to start another iteration, the first element of `lst` will be removed.
   - `elem` will take the value of the first element in the updated `lst`.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the new `elem` and the remaining elements in `lst`.
   - `final` will be updated to include the new `elem` if it makes `mini` the minimum value.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `mini` will be recalculated based on the new `elem` and the remaining elements in `lst`.
   - `final` will be updated to include the new `elem` if it makes `mini` the minimum value.
   - `lst` will be updated to exclude the first element.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `mini` will be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the updated `lst`.
- `final` will contain the first element of the updated `lst` followed by the element that makes `mini` the minimum value.
- `lst` will contain all elements except the first element.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the updated `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of the updated `lst` followed by the element that makes `mini` the minimum value, `lst` now contains all elements except the first element**.
