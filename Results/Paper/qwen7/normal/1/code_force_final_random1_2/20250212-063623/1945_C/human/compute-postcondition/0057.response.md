Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `lst` must be empty, `mini` will hold the minimum value among `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)` for every `ele` in the original `lst`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `lst` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `mini` will contain the smallest difference found between `pk` and any element in the original `lst`.
