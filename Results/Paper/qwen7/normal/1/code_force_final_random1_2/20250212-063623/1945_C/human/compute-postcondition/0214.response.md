Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 15, and `lst` is [5, 10, 15]**.

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Given that `ele` is 15, `abs(pk - ele)` simplifies to `abs(pk - 15)`. Since `lst` contains the values 5, 10, and 15, `abs(pk - 15)` will be 0 if `pk` is 15, and otherwise, it will be the distance from `pk` to 15. The minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - 15)` is stored in `mini`. The values of `ele` and `lst` remain unchanged.
