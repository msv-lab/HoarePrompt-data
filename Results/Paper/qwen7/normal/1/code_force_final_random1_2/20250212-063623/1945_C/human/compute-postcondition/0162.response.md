Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `final` now includes the element `n`.
