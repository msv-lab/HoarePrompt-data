Output State: **`zero` is either 1, 2, or 3; `zero_perc` is 100; `i` is 4; `one` is 1; `one_perc` is -300; `lst` contains the elements 2, 4, and 5; `o` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the elements 2, 4, and 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
