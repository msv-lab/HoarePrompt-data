Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`.
- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`.
- `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.

The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the list `final`.

To determine what `final[0]` is, we need to consider the conditions under which `final` is populated:

1. `final` is populated with elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`.
2. If `len(final)` is 0, then:
   - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will contain an additional element `0`.
   - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` will include the element `n`.

Given these conditions, the value of `final[0]` depends on whether `final` is empty and the value of `c1`.

However, since the exact values of `lst`, `pk`, `o`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `final[0]`. But we can describe it based on the conditions.

Output: **0 if len(final) is 0 and c1 >= 50, otherwise the smallest element in lst that is closest to pk**
