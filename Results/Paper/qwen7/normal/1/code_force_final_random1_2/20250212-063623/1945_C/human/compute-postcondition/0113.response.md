Postcondition: `zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, then the list `lst` contains `i + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
