Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t, an integer n, and a binary string s of length n. For each test case, it calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string. If at any point both percentages reach or exceed 50%, it records the position. After identifying such positions, it selects the closest one to n/2 (or n+1)/2 if n is odd). If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the majority count of '0's or '1's. Finally, it outputs the selected position for each test case.**
