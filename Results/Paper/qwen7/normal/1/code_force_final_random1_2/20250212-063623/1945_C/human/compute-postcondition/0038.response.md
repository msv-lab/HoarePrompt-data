Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 2; `zero_perc` is 100 or 50; `i` is 3; `one_perc` is -400; `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4.**

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the elements 2 and 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
