Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(t)`. This means the loop variable `_` is incremented in each iteration, but no other variables are directly modified within the loop head.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was some positive integer.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - After the current iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop continuation, we need to decrement `t` by 1.
   - All other variables (`lst`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, etc.) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0`**.
