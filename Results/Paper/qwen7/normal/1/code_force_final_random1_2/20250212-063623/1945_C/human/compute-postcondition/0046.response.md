Output State: **`zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `i` is 4, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is -400, `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4, `zero_perc` is 100**.

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to the value of `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given the initial state, `zero` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is 4. If `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` becomes `1 * 100 // (4 + 1)` which is 20. However, since `zero_perc` is initially 100 or 50, `zero` cannot be 1 because that would make `zero_perc` 20, which contradicts the initial state. If `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` becomes `2 * 100 // (4 + 1)` which is 40. Again, this does not match the initial state. Therefore, `zero` must be 3, making `zero_perc` equal to `3 * 100 // (4 + 1)` which is 60. But since `zero_perc` is initially 100 or 50, the only consistent value for `zero` is 3, and `zero_perc` remains 100. All other variables remain unchanged.
