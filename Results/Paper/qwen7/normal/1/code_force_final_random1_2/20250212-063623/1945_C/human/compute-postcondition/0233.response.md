Output State: **`mini` is 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [15, 20], `final` is [5, 10, 15, 20], `pk` is 25, `elem` is 20**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. Initially, `final` is `[5, 10, 15, 20]`. After sorting, `final` becomes `[5, 10, 15, 20]`. The values of `mini`, `ele`, `lst`, `pk`, and `elem` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
