Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` is undefined, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, the variables `o` and `one` are not defined in the initial state, so they remain undefined. The other conditions and values from the initial state are preserved.
