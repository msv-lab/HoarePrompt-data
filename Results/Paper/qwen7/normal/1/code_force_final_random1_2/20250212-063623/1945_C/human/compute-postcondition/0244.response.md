Output State: **The final output will be a single integer, either 0 or n.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `final` list will contain either 0 or n based on the conditions evaluated within the loop. Specifically, if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, 0 is appended to `final`. Otherwise, n is appended. Since `final` is defined to contain just one element after the loop, and given the conditions provided, the final output will be either 0 or n.
