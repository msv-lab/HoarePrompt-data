Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in the original `lst`, `final` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `final`. The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, updating `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. After processing all elements in `lst`, `lst` becomes empty, and `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in the original `lst`. The list `final` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet.
