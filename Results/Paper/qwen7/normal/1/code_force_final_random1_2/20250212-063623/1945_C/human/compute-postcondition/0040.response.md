Postcondition: **`zero` is either 1 or 2; `zero_perc` is 100 or 50; `i` is 3; `one_perc` is -400; `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is true or false, the variables `zero`, `zero_perc`, `i`, and `one_perc` retain their initial values, and `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4.
