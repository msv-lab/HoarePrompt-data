### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the size of the village `n` and the preferences string `s`.

2. **Middle Point Calculation**: The program calculates `pk` as `n / 2`, which is used to find the optimal position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village.

3. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The program counts the number of zeros (`zero`) and ones (`one`) in the preferences string `s`.

4. **Iterating Through Positions**: The program iterates through each possible position `i` from 0 to `n-2` (since the road can be placed between houses). For each position, it updates the counts of zeros and ones and calculates the percentage of satisfied residents on both sides.

5. **Satisfaction Check**: The program checks if the number of satisfied residents on both sides meets the requirement (`>= ceil(x/2)`). If it does, the position `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`.

6. **Finding Optimal Position**: After collecting all valid positions in `lst`, the program finds the one that is closest to the middle point `pk`. If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smallest one.

7. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no valid position is found, the program checks the overall satisfaction of the entire village. If more than half of the residents are satisfied with their side, it prints `0`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

8. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the optimal position `i` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
