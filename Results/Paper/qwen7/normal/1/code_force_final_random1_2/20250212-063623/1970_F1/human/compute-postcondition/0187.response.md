Postcondition: `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If the position `pos` is in a goal area (`goalIn(pos) != -1`), `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `com` is not 'T', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and if `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `obj` is an active player.
