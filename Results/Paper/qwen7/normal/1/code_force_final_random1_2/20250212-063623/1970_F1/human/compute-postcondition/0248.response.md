Postcondition: `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the new position of the player after moving, `nxt` is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]). If `com` is 'T', and a goal is scored, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
