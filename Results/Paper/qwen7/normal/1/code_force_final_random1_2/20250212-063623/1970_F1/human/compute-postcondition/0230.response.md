Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `comand` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, `obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `el` is the third element of the `comand` list, `team` is 1 if the first element of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, points[team] is 10 more than its previous value**.

This means that the `points` dictionary's value for the key `team` (either 0 or 1) has been incremented by 10. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
