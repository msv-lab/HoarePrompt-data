Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list which is '.', `team` is 0, `points[team]` is 10**.

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since `team` is initially 0, `points[0]` is updated to 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
