Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `grid` is an empty list, (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entities to their positions on the field with '.B': (-1, -1), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is now [[], []], `points` is [0, 0], `mov` is a dictionary mapping movement commands (U, D, L, R) to their corresponding changes in position, `t` is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `line` - 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`. For each index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All players in the `line` have been processed, and the `elements` dictionary contains the player indices for all players encountered in `line`. The `allPlayers` dictionary marks all players as `False`. The `goal` list contains tuples indicating the positions of blue (`B`) and green (`G`) goals.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is equal to the length of `line`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[-1][0]` equals 'B', 1 otherwise, and `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)` for every index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not '..', `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False` for each player found in `line`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
