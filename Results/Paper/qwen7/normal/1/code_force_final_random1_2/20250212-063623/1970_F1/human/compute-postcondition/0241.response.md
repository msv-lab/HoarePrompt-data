Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is False.**

Explanation: The code `team = goalIn(pos)` assigns the result of the function `goalIn(pos)` to the variable `team`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
