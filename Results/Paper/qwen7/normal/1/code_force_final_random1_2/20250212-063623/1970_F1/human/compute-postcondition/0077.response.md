Output State: **`i` is now assigned to `elements[line[ind]]`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is `False`; otherwise, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind + 1)`, and `goal[tmp]` has appended the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. The values of `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, `tmp`, and `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` remain as described in the initial state, except that `goal[tmp]` now includes the new tuple `(i, ind)`.
