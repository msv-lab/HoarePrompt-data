Output State: **`i` is now `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind + 1)` and another tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. The values of `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information added is that `goal[tmp]` now contains these two tuples.
