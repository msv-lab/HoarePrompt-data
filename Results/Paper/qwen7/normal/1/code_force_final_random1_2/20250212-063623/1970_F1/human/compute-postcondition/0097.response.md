Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces; `grid` is a list that now includes the `line` list as its last element.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the `line` list to the `grid` list. The values of `i`, `n`, and `line` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new information is that `grid` now contains the `line` list as its latest element.
