Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is either 2 or remains 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `ind` becomes 2. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)`.
