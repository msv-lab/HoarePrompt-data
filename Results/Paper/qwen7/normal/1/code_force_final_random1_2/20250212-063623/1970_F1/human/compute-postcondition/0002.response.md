The function `isPlayer` accepts a parameter `el`, which is a string representing an entity on the field. The first character of `el` indicates the team (R for Red, B for Blue), and the second character (if present) indicates the player number. The function returns a boolean value `res` which is True if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. Otherwise, it returns False.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `el`, checks if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', and returns `True` if both conditions are met, otherwise returns `False`.**
