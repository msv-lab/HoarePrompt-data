Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ind` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `line`.
   - `line` is a list of strings with at least one element.
   - The conditions related to `line[ind]` are:
     - If `line[ind]` is not `..`, then `line[ind]` is not assigned the value `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and either `line[ind][1]` equals 'G' and `goal[0]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` with the value of `tmp` being 0, or `line[ind][1]` does not equal 'G'.
     - If `line[ind]` is `..`, no changes are made to `line[ind]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `ind` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `ind` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `ind` should be less than the length of `line`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `line`, and `ind` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop can continue if `ind` is less than the length of `line`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ind` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
   - `line` remains the same unless the loop body makes changes, but since no specific changes are mentioned, `line` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions related to `line[ind]` will be checked again for `ind = 2`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`ind` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `line`, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, and the following conditions hold:**
- If `line[ind]` is not `..`, then `line[ind]` is not assigned the value `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and either `line[ind][1]` equals 'G' and `goal[0]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` with the value of `tmp` being 0, or `line[ind][1]` does not equal 'G'.
- If `line[ind]` is `..`, no changes are made to `line[ind]`.
