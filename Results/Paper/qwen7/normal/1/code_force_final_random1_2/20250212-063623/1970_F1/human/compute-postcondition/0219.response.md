Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple equal to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]). If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if the position `pos` is a goal position, where `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`. Otherwise, if the player at index `obj` exists, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**
