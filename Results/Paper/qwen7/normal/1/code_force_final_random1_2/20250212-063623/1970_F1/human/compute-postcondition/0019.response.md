Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `tmp` based on the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'`. Since `line[ind][0]` is either 'B' or not 'B', `tmp` will be assigned either 0 or 1 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
