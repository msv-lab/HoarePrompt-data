Output State: **`ind` is 3; `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; `elements[line[ind]]` is `[i, 3]`**

Explanation: The line `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. Since `ind` is 3, `line[ind]` is the same as `line[3]`. Therefore, `allPlayers[line[3]]` is set to `False`. The values of `ind` and `elements[line[ind]]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
