Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings where each element is a string split from the input, `grid` is a list containing the `line`, for each index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `line`. This changes the value of `line` from a non-empty list of strings to a list of strings obtained from the input. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
