Output State: **`ind` is 3; `tmp` is 1**

Explanation: The code checks if `line[ind][0]` is equal to 'B'. Since `line[ind][0]` is 'i' (as `elements[line[ind]]` is `[i, 3]`), the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'` is false. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `ind` remains unchanged.
