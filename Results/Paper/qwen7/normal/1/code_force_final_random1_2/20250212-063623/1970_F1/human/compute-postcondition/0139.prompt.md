Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces; `grid` is a list that now includes the `line` list as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `line`, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, and the following conditions hold:
- If `line[ind]` is not '..', `line[ind]` is not assigned the value `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and either `line[ind][1]` equals 'G' and `goal[0]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` with the value of `tmp` being 0, or `line[ind][1]` does not equal 'G'.
- If `line[ind]` is '..', no changes are made to `line[ind]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `elements[line[ind]]` remains `[i, 3]`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` contains an element which is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', then no change occurs to `goal[tmp]` and `elements[line[ind]]` remains `[i, 3]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 4, `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` equals 'B', 1 otherwise, and `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` evaluates to False, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
