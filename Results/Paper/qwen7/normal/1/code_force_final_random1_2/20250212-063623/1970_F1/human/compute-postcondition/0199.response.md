Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 1, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since `team` is determined by whether `obj[0]` is 'B', `points[team]` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
