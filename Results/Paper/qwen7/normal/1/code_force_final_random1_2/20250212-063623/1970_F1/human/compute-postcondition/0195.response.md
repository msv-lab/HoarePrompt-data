Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 1, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, and `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code `comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `comand`. The other variables (`t`, `time`, `command`, `obj`, and `com`) remain unchanged.
