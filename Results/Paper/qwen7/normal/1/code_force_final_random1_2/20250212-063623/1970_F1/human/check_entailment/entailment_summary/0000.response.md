Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly processes the game scenario according to the problem statement. It initializes the grid, reads the initial setup, and handles various game events such as movement, catching, throwing, and scoring. The function also correctly identifies when a player scores in the wrong goal and prints the appropriate messages. It finally prints the final scores of both teams.

2. **Function `goalIn`**: This function correctly determines whether a given position corresponds to a red or blue goal. It returns 0 for a red goal and 1 for a blue goal, which is used to identify scoring events.

3. **Function `isPlayer`**: This function correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player. It checks if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', which matches the criteria for a player as defined in the problem statement.

Given that all three functions work as expected and collectively handle the game logic correctly, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
