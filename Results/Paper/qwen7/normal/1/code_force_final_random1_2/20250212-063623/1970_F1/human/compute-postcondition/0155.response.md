Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list which is '.', `team` is 0**.

Explanation: The condition checks if the first element (`obj[0]`) of the `command` list is 'B'. Since `el` (the third element) is '.', it means `obj` could be something like 'A...'. Therefore, `obj[0]` is not 'B', and the `team` variable is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
