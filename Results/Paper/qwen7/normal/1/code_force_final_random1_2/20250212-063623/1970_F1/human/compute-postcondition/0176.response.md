Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.

Given the initial state:
- `time` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, but we don't have the specific value of `pos` or the function `goalIn(pos)`, so we'll keep it as `team`.
- `GoalName[team]` is the name of the team that scored the goal, corresponding to the value of `team`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `time` which is 0.
- `GoalName[team]` which is the name of the team that scored the goal.

Output: **0 GoalName[team]**
