Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `line`, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, and the following conditions hold:
- If `line[ind]` is not '..', `line[ind]` is not assigned the value `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and either `line[ind][1]` equals 'G' and `goal[0]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` with the value of `tmp` being 0, or `line[ind][1]` does not equal 'G'.
- If `line[ind]` is '..', no changes are made to `line[ind]`.
