Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `line` list using `range(len(line))`. This means `ind` will take on values from `0` to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is assigned to either `elements[line[ind]]` or `elements['G']`.
   - `ind` remains the same.
   - `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\).
   - `line` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` is evaluated as follows:
     - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.
     - Otherwise, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `ind` remains the same, it will take on the next value in the range, which is `ind + 1` (assuming it hasn't reached the end of the list yet).
   - The value of `i` will be reassigned based on the new `line[ind + 1]` (if it exists).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `line` remains unchanged.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` will determine the value of `i` and the state of `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` or the content of `goal[tmp]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ind` will be incremented by 1.
   - `i` will be reassigned based on `line[ind]` (or `elements['G']` if `ind` is out of bounds).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ind` will be `ind + 1`.
- `i` will be reassigned to either `elements[line[ind]]` or `elements['G']` (if `ind` is within bounds).

Since the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without the loop body, we'll keep it in terms of the assignment.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is assigned to either `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is `False`; otherwise, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind + 1)`.**
