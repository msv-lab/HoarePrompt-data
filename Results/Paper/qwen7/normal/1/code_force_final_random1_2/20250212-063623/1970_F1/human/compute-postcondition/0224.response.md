Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 1 or 2, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input. If `len(comand) == 3`, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` if `el` is '.Q', otherwise `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value. If `len(comand) != 3`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple equal to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is either `'.B'` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True, or `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B'] == nxt`. If `obj` does not meet the above conditions, `player` remains unchanged. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if the position `pos` is a goal position, where `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`. Otherwise, if the player at index `obj` exists, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**
