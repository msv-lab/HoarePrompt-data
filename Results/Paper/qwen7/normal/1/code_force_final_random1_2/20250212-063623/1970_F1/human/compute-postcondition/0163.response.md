Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element in the `elements` list at the index specified by `obj` to the variable `pos`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
