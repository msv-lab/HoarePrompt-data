Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of `line` - 1.
   - `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99.
   - `line` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`.
   - For each index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will increment from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The `line`, `grid`, `elements`, `isPlayer`, `tmp`, and `goal` are not directly modified by the loop itself, so their states remain the same unless the loop body modifies them, which is not specified here.

Given the above points, the only state that changes is `i` (it increases by 1), while `n` remains the same.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `i` is now 1 (since it was `length(line) - 1` before and the loop increments `i` by 1).
- `n` remains an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99.
- `line`, `grid`, `elements`, `isPlayer`, `tmp`, and `goal` remain unchanged.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, for each index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`**.
