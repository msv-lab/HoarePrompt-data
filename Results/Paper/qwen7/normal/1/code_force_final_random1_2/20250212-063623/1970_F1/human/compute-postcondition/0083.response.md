Postcondition: `i` is assigned to either `elements[line[ind]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1.
