Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 2, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)`**.

Explanation: The line `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `ind` is 2, the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` determines which list in `goal` the tuple is appended to (`goal[0]` if `tmp` is 0, or `goal[1]` if `tmp` is 1). Since the value of `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `line[2]`, `goal[tmp]` will contain the tuple `(0, 2)`.
