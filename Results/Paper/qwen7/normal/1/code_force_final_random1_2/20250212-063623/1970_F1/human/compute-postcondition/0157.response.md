Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `el` is the third element of the `command` list, which is `'.'`.
   - `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `team` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `GoalName[team]` refers to `GoalName[0]`. Since `GoalName` is not explicitly defined, we assume it is a list where `GoalName[0]` corresponds to the goal name for team 0. However, since the exact value of `GoalName[0]` is not provided, we can only refer to it as `GoalName[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string with the format `%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`, where `%d` is replaced by the value of `time` (which is 0) and `%s` is replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]` (which is `GoalName[0]`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
