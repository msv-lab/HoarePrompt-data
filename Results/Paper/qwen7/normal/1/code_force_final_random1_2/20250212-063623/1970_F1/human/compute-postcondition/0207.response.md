Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `comand` is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple equal to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `time` to 2 and calculates the new position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector `mov[com]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
