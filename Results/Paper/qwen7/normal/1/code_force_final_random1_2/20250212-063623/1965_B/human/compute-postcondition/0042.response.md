Postcondition: **`i` is either `l - 1` or 5, `ans` is a list containing either [4, 8, 16, 32] or [2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], depending on the value of `k`.**

Explanation: If `k == 1`, then `i` will be 5 and `ans` will contain [4, 8, 16, 32]. Otherwise, `i` will be `l - 1` and `ans` will contain a list of values starting from 2, including powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\), and additional values \(k - 2^{lk}\), \(k + 1\), and \(2 * k + 1\).
