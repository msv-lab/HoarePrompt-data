Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer representing the number of test cases (t). For each test case, it returns a list of two integers [n, k] where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.**

This means the function `func_15` does not take any parameters. It first returns an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases. Then, for each of these `t` test cases, it returns a list containing two integers `[n, k]` where `n` is between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive) and `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
