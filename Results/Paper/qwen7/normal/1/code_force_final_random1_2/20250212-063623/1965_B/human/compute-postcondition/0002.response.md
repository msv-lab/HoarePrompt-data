Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the expression `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will run `func_10()` times. The variables involved here are the return value of `func_10()` and the loop variable `_`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which typically indicates it is used as a throwaway variable (it is not used within the loop body). Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted for this variable.
   - The key variable here is the return value of `func_10()`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Analyze the Given Information**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `func_14()` returns an integer, and `n` and `k` retain their original values.
   - The loop will run `func_10()` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that allows the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop will run `func_10()` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that is greater than or equal to the current number of iterations plus one.
   - Let's denote the number of iterations completed so far as `current_iterations`. After the previous iteration, `current_iterations` is one less than the return value of `func_10()` from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `func_14()` still returns an integer.
   - `n` and `k` retain their original values.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that allows the loop to continue. Therefore, `func_10()` must return a value that is at least `current_iterations + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and func_10() must return a value that is at least the number of iterations completed so far plus one**.

Since the exact number of iterations completed so far is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and func_10() must return a value that is at least the number of iterations completed so far plus one**.

However, if we assume the loop just started or completed its first iteration, then the simplest adjustment would be:

State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and func_10() must return a value of at least 1**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and func_10() must return a value of at least 1**.
