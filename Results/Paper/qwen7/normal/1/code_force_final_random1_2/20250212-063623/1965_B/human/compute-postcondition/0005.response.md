Output State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and sys.stdout writes the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_14()` converted to a string, followed by a newline character to the standard output. However, since the initial state specifies that `func_14()` returns an integer, the integer returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their original values, and the fact that `func_10()` returns a positive integer is also retained in the output state.
