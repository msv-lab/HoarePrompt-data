Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k == 1`, then `i` is 5, `l` is greater than 5, and `ans` contains the values [4, 8, 16, 32]. Otherwise, `i` is `l - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.
