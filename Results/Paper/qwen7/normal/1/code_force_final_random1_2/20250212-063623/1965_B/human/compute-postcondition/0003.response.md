Output State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n retains its original value, k retains its original value, and the stdout writes the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_14()` converted to a string followed by a newline character to the standard output. Since `func_14()` returns an integer, the integer is converted to a string before being written. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition that `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1 is not affected by this code snippet.
