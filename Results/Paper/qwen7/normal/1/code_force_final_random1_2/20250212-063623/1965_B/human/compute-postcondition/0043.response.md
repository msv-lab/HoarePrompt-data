Output State: **The program returns a string that contains the elements of the list `ans` converted to strings and joined together with spaces. The list `ans` can either be [4, 8, 16, 32] or [2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1], depending on the value of `k`.**

This means the output will be a string representation of the list `ans` with its elements separated by spaces. The exact content of the string depends on whether `i` is `l - 1` or 5, which determines the structure of the list `ans`.
