Output State: **`i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `ql`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
