Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[0] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[0] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user, `b` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `bd` as a list containing only one element which is 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, `ql`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `ad` remain unchanged from their initial states.
