Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)`, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `b` from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `b`. The list `bd` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `b`, starting from the second element (`b[1]`) down to the last element (`b[len(b) - 1]`).
