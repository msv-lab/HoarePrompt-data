Output State: **`i` is 2; `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the code calculates `a[1] - a[0]` and appends this value to `ad`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment itself is not explicitly shown in the code, the next operation would require `i` to be 2), and `ad` contains the computed difference. The precondition that `len(a) > 1` remains valid.
