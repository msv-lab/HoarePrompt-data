Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`**.

Explanation: The line `m = 0` sets the variable `m` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
