Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `len(a)`. 

4. **Calculate the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `2` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since only the variables in the loop head can be adjusted, we update `i` to `2`. The list `ad` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`**
