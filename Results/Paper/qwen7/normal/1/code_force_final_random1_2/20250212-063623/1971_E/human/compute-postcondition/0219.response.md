Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`.
   - Since `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, let's assume `s` is determined based on the sorted order of `a`.

3. **Value of `m`:**
   - We need to know the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `ql` to compute `m`.
   - However, since these values are not explicitly given, we can only express `m` in terms of these variables.

Given the information, the value of `m` is:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \cdot (ql - a[s - 1])}{ad[s]} \]

4. **Printing `int(m)`:**
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer part of `m`.

Since the exact values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `ql` are not provided, we can only describe `m` in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]))**
