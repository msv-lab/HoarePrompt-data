Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(b))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `bd` includes the new element `b[3] - b[2]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < len(b)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be 4 if the loop continues.

5. **Check the condition for including the next element in `bd`**:
   - The next element to be included in `bd` would be `b[4] - b[3]`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 4.
   - `bd` should include the new element `b[4] - b[3]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `bd` includes the new element `b[4] - b[3]`**.
