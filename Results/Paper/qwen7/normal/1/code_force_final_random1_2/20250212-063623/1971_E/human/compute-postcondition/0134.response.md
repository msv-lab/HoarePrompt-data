Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved here are `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`
   - `i` is 2
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`
   - `l` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` is the variable in the loop head, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `l` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - The other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `m` remains `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`
   - `i` remains 2
   - `s` remains the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`
   - `l` is now 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 2, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`, `l` is 3**
