Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

The code simply initializes `bd` as a list containing a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, or `b`, nor does it change the value of `ad`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of `bd` being initialized to `[0]`.
