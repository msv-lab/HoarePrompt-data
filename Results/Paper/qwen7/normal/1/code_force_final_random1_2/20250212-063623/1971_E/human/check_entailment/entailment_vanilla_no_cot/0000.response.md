Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a brief explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the positions `a` and times `b` where the car arrives at those positions.
   - It calculates the distances between consecutive positions (`ad`) and the corresponding time differences (`bd`).
   - It calculates the speeds between consecutive positions (`v`).
3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of the journey where the queried position `ql` lies.
   - It calculates the exact time taken to reach the queried position using the precomputed speeds and distances.
   - The result is printed, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.
