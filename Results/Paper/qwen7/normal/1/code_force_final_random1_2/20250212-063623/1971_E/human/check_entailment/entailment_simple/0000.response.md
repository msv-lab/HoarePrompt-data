Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and processes each test case individually.
2. It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and uses these to derive the speeds between these points.
3. For each query `d`, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which `d` lies.
4. It then calculates the time taken to travel from the start of the segment to `d` using the derived speeds.
5. The logic for handling the exact match and calculating the time is sound and correctly implemented.
6. The program prints the results for each query as required.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification correctly and handles all edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
