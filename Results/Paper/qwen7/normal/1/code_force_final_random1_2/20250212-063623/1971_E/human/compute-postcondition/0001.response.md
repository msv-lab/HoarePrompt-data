Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring that it is a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
