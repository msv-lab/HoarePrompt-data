Output State: **`ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 2**.

Explanation: The line `m = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `m`. All other variables (`ql`, `a[s - 1]`, `i`, `s`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
