Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 1.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `a[s - 1]` from `ql`. Since `a[s - 1]` is part of the precondition and its value is not specified, we express `ql` as `ql - a[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
