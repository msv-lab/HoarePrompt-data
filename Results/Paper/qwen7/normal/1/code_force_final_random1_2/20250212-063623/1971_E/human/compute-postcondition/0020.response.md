Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[2] - b[1]`, and `bd` is updated to contain the value `b[3] - b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to `bd.append(b[3] - b[2])`. Since `bd` initially contained the value `b[2] - b[1]`, after executing the code, `bd` will now contain both `b[2] - b[1]` and `b[3] - b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
