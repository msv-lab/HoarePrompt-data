Output State: **`i` is 4; `ad` is a list containing the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], a[4] - a[3]]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 4, `a[i]` is `a[4]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]`. Therefore, `a[4] - a[3]` is appended to `ad`, making `ad` now contain `[a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], a[4] - a[3]]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `len(a)` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
