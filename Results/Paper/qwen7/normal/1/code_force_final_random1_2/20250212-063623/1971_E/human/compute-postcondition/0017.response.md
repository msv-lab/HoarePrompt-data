Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` is a list
   - `ad` is an empty list
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(b)` must be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `b` remains a list (no change needed).
   - `ad` remains an empty list (no change needed).
   - `bd` remains a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]` (no change needed).

Given these steps, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**.
