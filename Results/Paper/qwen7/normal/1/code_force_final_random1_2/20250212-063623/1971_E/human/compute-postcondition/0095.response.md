Output State: `bd` is a list containing the differences between every pair of consecutive elements in `b` from the second element to the last element.

This means that if `b` has `n` elements, `bd` will contain `n-1` elements, each representing the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`. The loop runs until `i` reaches `len(b)`, so it will append the difference `b[i] - b[i-1]` for each valid `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b)-1`.
