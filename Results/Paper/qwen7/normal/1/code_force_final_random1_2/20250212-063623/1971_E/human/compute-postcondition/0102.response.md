Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len(b)` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v` contains the value `[ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3]]`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is currently 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `len(a)` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the updated states are:

- `len(b)` must still be at least 1.
- `i` will be 4.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`len(b)` must be at least 1, `i` is 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 3**
