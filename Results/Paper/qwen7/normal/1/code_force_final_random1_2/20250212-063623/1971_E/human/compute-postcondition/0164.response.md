Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` is a list or iterable with at least one element; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`**.

Explanation: The code appends to `bd` the difference between the current element `b[i]` (which is `b[1]` since `i` is 1) and the previous element `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`). Since `b` has at least one element, `b[0]` exists. Therefore, `bd` now contains an additional element which is the result of `b[1] - b[0]`. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged except for the new element added to `bd`.
