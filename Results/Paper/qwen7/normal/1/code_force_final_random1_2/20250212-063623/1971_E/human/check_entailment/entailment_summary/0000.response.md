Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( q \), and constructs the lists \( a \) and \( b \).
3. It then calculates the differences \( ad \) and \( bd \) which represent the distances and times between the known points.
4. The program computes the speed \( v \) between each pair of points, which is done correctly.
5. For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment of the journey where the query point \( ql \) falls.
6. It then calculates the exact time taken to reach \( ql \) within that segment, taking into account the cumulative time and the speed of travel between segments.
7. The calculations and logic used to determine the time taken for each query seem to follow the problem's requirements accurately.

Given the detailed breakdown, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
