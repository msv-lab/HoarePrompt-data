The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( q \). For each test case, it reads two lists \( a \) and \( b \), both strictly increasing. It then calculates intermediate values \( ad \) and \( bd \) based on differences between consecutive elements of \( a \) and \( b \), respectively. Using these values, it computes a series of cumulative sums \( m \) for given queries \( ql \). For each query, it finds the appropriate position in list \( a \) and calculates \( m \) using the corresponding values from \( b \) and \( ad \) and \( bd \). Finally, it prints the result for each query.
