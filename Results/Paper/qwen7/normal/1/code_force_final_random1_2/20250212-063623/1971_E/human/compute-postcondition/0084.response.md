Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`. This means `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(a)`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop can execute again if `len(a)` is greater than `2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from `2` to `3`.
   - `ad` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ad` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3.
- `ad` is still a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`**.
