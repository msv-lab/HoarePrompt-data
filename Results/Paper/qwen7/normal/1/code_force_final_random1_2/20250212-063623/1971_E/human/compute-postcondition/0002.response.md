Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them into `n`, `k`, and `q`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, while `n`, `k`, and `q` are the integers obtained from the input.
