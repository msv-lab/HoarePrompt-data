Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(t)` part of the for loop. This means the variables that can be adjusted are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `q` is an input integer
   - `l` is 2
   - `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`
   - `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `t` is the only one in the loop head that can be adjusted.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is greater than 0.

**State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `t` must be greater than 0**
