Output State: **`i` is 2, `v` contains a value equal to `ad[1] / bd[1]`**

Explanation: The code `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the expression `ad[i] / bd[i]` evaluates to `ad[1] / bd[1]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (since the index used is `i`), making `i` equal to 2. The list `v` now contains one element, which is the result of the division `ad[1] / bd[1]`.
