Output State: **`m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`, `l` is 3, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified or recalculated within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of `m`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` is still dependent on the `bisect_left` function call with `a` and `ql`.
