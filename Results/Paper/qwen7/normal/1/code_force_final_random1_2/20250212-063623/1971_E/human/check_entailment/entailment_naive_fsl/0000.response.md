Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the queried point `d` lies between two known points in the sequence. Specifically, the program uses binary search to find the segment in which `d` lies but does not correctly calculate the time taken to travel from the start of that segment to `d`.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
1
10 2 4
4 10
4 7
6
4
2
7
```

The program's output is:
```
5 4 2 5
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
5 4 2 5
```

But let's look at the calculation for `d = 2`:
- The car is between points 4 and 10.
- The speed between these points is \( \frac{10 - 4}{7 - 4} = 2 \) units per minute.
- To travel from point 4 to point 2, the car would take \( \frac{2 - 4}{2} = -1 \) minutes, which is incorrect.

The program incorrectly assumes that the speed calculated between two points applies linearly to any point within that segment without considering the exact position relative to the start of the segment. This leads to incorrect time calculations for points that are not exactly at the segment boundaries.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
