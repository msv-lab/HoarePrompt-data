Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `a` with the first element being 0, followed by integers inputted from the user. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, `ql`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
