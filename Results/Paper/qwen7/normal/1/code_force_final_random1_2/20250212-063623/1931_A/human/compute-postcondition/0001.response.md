Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\). Additionally, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided results in a valid number of iterations for the loop.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78.
- The loop will run for the number of times equal to the input provided by `int(input())`.

Since `t` is a positive integer and `n` is an integer within a specific range, we can assume that the input provided by `int(input())` will be a valid integer within the range of `t`. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input is a valid integer and within the expected range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring it is a valid integer and within the range of `t`.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\)
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'
- The input provided by `int(input())` must be a valid integer and within the range of `t`

However, since the loop will execute based on the input provided, we can simplify the state to focus on the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

**State:**
- The input provided by `int(input())` must be a valid integer and within the range of `t` (i.e., \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 100\))

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **The input provided by `int(input())` must be a valid integer and within the range of `t` (i.e., \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 100\))**.
