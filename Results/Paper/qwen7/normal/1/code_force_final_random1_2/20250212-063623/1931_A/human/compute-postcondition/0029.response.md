Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. `word` is defined as either 'zz' plus the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz', or 'az', or 'aaa'.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
4. The input value remains the same (though this is not directly relevant to the print statement).

To determine what `word` will be, we need to consider the range of `n` and how it affects the construction of `word`.

- If `n` is between 1 and 52, then `n - 53` would be a negative number, which is not valid for indexing into the alphabet.
- If `n` is between 53 and 100, then `n - 53` would be a number between 0 and 47, corresponding to characters 'a' through 'z'.

Given the definition of `word`, if `n` is between 53 and 100, `word` will be 'zz' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 53`, followed by 'zz'. For example, if `n` is 54, then `n - 53` is 1, so `word` would be 'zzazzz'. If `n` is 65, then `n - 53` is 12, so `word` would be 'zzmzzz'.

If `n` is outside the range 53 to 100, `word` could be 'az' or 'aaa'. However, since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, these cases are not applicable here.

Therefore, for any valid `n` (between 53 and 100), `word` will be constructed as described.

Output: **'zz' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet, followed by 'zz'**
