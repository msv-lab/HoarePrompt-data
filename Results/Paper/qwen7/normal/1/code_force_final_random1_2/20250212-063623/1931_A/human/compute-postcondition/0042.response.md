Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two values, t and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and n is an integer between 3 and 78. The function returns a value based on these implied inputs.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these values internally without requiring them to be passed as explicit parameters. It checks if t is within the range of 1 to 100 and if n is within the range of 3 to 78, then it returns a value based on these conditions.
