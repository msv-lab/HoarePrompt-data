Output State: **`n` is an integer between 27 and 52, `word` is 'az', and `n` is less than or equal to 52**.

Explanation: The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` to the string `word`. Given that `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `n - 28` will range from -1 to 4. However, since `alphabet` is a sequence of letters starting from 'a', `alphabet[n - 28]` will be a valid letter corresponding to the index `n - 28`. Thus, `word` becomes `'az'` because `'a'` and `'z'` are concatenated. The other variables remain unchanged.
