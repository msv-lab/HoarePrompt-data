Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is either "zz" followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` if `n` is greater than 52, or 'az' if `n` is between 27 and 52, or 'aaa' if `n` is between 1 and 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but the conditions for `word` remain the same as per the initial state. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same as the one provided by the user.
