Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `n`.
3. The logic to construct the word from the encoded integer `n` is as follows:
   - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This handles cases where the sum of the positions of the three letters is greater than 52, which can only happen if the third letter is 'z'.
   - If `n > 26`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This handles cases where the sum of the positions of the three letters is between 27 and 52, which means the second letter must be 'z'.
   - Otherwise, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This handles the remaining cases where the sum of the positions of the three letters is between 3 and 26, meaning the third letter can be any letter from 'a' to 'z'.

Given these conditions, the program constructs the lexicographically smallest possible word for each test case based on the encoded integer `n`.

Therefore, the program logic matches the requirements of the problem statement and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
