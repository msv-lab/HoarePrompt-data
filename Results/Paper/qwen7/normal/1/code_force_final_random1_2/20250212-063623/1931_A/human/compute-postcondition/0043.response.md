Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \)). For each \( n \), it constructs a string `word` based on specific rules and prints it. If \( n \) is greater than 52, `word` is formed by appending 'zz' to the character at position \( n - 53 \) in the lowercase alphabet. If \( n \) is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is formed by appending 'z' to the character at position \( n - 28 \) in the lowercase alphabet, and 'a' before it. Otherwise, `word` is formed by appending 'zz' to the character at position \( n - 3 \) in the lowercase alphabet, with 'aa' before it. The function does not return any value but prints the constructed string for each test case.**
