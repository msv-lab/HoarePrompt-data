Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `1000 + sum(x[0] to x[j-1])`, assuming `n` is greater than 3.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, starting with `a[0]` being 1000, and each subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-1`) will be the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `j` elements of the list `x`.
