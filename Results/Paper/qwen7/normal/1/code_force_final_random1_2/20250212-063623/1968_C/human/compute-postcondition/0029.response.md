Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`. This means `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `i` is in the range `[n-1]`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
   - `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Here, `x` is a list of integers, and `a` is initialized with `a[0] = 1000`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each `i`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - This means:
     - `a[0] = 1000` (initial value).
     - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x[0]`.
     - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1]`.
     - And so on, until `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` is set to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the list `a` that was processed.
   - The list `a` is fully populated according to the loop logic.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(*a)` will print the contents of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, let's express the final output:

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], (1000 + x[0]) + x[1], ..., (1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])**
