Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` is a list of 3 zeros with the first element being 1000, `a[1]` is 1000, `a[2]` is 2000, `a[3]` is 3000 (though this information is not relevant to adjusting the loop state).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
