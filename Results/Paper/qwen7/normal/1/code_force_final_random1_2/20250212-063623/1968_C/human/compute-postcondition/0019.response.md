Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a[0]` is 1000, `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[0]` is set to 1000.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The value of `a[i]` is now `a[0] + sum(x)`, which means `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x)`.
- The list `a` is still of length `n` but now `a[0]` is 1000 and the rest of the elements are still 0.
- The list `x` and the value of `n` remain as they were before the assignment, but `a[0]` has been updated.
