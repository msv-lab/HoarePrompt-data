Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list of 3 zeros with the first element being 1000, `a[1]` is 1000, `a[2]` is 2000, `a[3]` is 3000**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` (which is not specified but inferred to be at least 3) zeros with the first element being 1000, and `a[2]` is updated to `a[1] + x[1]`. The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates `a[2]` to `a[1] + x[1]`, which is `1000 + x[1]`. Since `x[1]` is not defined in the initial state but we know `a[2]` was updated to `2000`, we infer `x[1]` must be 1000. The code does not define `x`, so its value remains unknown. However, the list `a` now has `a[3]` updated to `a[2] + x[2]`, which would be `2000 + x[2]`, but since `x[2]` is not defined, we assume it follows the pattern and set `a[3]` to `3000` based on the given pattern.
