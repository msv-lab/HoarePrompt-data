Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`.
   - `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - `a[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless it is updated by another input.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.**

To express this clearly:

State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**
