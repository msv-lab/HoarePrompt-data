Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`, `n` must be at least 2.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n` (i.e., `n-1`). The value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[0]` plus the sum of all elements in the list `x`. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed even once.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `n` retains its value as it was last updated via user input.
- The variable `i` is set to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the list `a` that was processed.
- The list `a` has been fully populated according to the loop logic: starting with `a[0] = 1000`, each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(j))`. This means that `a[j]` is the sum of 1000 and the first `j+1` elements of the list `x`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and the list `a` will contain `n` elements. The value of `a[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to `n-1` will be 1000 plus the sum of the first `j+1` elements from the list `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
