Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`.
- `n` must be at least 2.

We need to determine what will be printed when `print(*a)` is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - Given: `i = n - 1`.
   - This means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.

2. **Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Given: `a[i] = a[0] + sum(x)`.
   - This means the last element of the list `a` is the sum of the first element of `a` and the sum of all elements in the list `x`.

3. **Value of `a[0]`:**
   - Since `a[0]` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. However, it is the first element of the list `a`.

4. **Sum of `x`:**
   - `sum(x)` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`.

5. **Structure of `a`:**
   - We know the last element of `a` (`a[n-1]`) is `a[0] + sum(x)`.
   - The rest of the elements in `a` are not specified, so we assume they might be other elements or could be unspecified.

### Conclusion:

Given the information, the list `a` will have at least two elements, with the last element being `a[0] + sum(x)`. The exact values of the other elements in `a` are not specified but do not affect the print statement since only `*a` is used, which unpacks the list.

### Final Output:

Output: **[a[0], ..., a[n-2], a[0] + sum(x)]** (where `a[0]` is the first element of `a`, and `a[n-2]` represents all elements except the last one, which is `a[0] + sum(x)`).
