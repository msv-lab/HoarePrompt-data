Output State: `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(j))`. This means that `a[j]` is the sum of 1000 and the first `j+1` elements of the list `x`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and the list `a` will contain `n` elements. The value of `a[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to `n-1` will be 1000 plus the sum of the first `j+1` elements from the list `x`.
