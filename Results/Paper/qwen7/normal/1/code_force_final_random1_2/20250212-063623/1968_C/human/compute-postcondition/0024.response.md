Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`.
   - `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`, which means `i` must be in the range `[2, n-1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[2, n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**
