Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `a[0]` is 1000.**

The code assigns the value `1000` to the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
