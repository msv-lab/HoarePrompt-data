Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `x`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
