Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for` statement:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range generated by `range(int(input()))`.
   - `int(input())`: This is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the state of other variables.
   - The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, but since this is an input, it cannot be directly adjusted in the state.

4. **Consider the Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Determine the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be at least 1 (since the loop has already executed at least once).
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n-2`.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `n-2` because the loop will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- `a[i]` remains the same as it was calculated in the previous iteration.
- `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to have executed even once.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is equal to `n-2`, `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`, `n` must be at least 2.**
