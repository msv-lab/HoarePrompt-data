Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2 (it doesn't change based on the loop itself).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The value of `a[1]` remains unchanged as it was determined in the previous iteration and is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`**
