Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `a[i]`, or `x`. Therefore, these values remain as they were in the initial state.
