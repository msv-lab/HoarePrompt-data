Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Each test case consists of two arrays a and b, where a has n integers and b has m integers, and each integer in both arrays is a positive integer not exceeding 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a` up to `newk`, `bOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `b` up to `newk`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and the loop has executed all iterations where `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `i` was found in both `a` and `b` up to `newk`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `aOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `a` was found in the loop up to `newk`, `bOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `b` was found in the loop up to `newk`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is incremented by the number of iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, the function does nothing (as both conditions are met); otherwise, the function proceeds with the else part logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their final values after the loop, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values after the loop, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and either both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk` (which is `k // 2`), or at least one of them is not equal to `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
