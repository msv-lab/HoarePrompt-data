Postcondition: `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, and `(i not in a or aOnes > newk)`
