Postcondition: `aOnes` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1; `bOnes` is either 0 or 1; `i` must be less than or equal to `k`; and if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` becomes 1. If neither condition is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
