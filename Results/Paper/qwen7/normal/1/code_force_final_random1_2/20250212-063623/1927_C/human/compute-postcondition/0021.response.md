Postcondition: `aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is in `a`, and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.
