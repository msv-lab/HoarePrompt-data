Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are either 0 or 1. If `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are set according to their initial values. Otherwise, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their current values, and `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` is at least 2.**
