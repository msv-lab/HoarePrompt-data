Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code initializes the variable `aOnes` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
