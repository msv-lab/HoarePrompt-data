Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers.
