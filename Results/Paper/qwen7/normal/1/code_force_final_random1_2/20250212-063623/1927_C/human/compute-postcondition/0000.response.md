Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range. Since the loop starts with `t`, the initial value of `t` must be such that the loop can begin.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
