Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the maximum number of occurrences of any integer in `a` up to `newk`, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the maximum number of occurrences of any integer in `b` up to `newk`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is incremented by the number of iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`**
