Postcondition: `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `b` up to `newk`, `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is now a list of integers from the input, `b` is now a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, `k` is at least 1, `i` is found in `b` and the current value of `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.
