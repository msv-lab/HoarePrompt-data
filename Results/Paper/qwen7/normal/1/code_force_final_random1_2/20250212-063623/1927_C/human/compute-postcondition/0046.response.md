Postcondition: `aOnes` remains unchanged, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` becomes 1 more than its original value and `bOnes` remains 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged, `bOnes` is either 1 or 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`.
