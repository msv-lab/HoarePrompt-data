### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each case.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are correctly initialized from the input.

2. **Variables Initialization:**
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are used to count how many of the current numbers from 1 to `k` are found in `a` and `b` respectively.
   - `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which is the number of elements needed to be chosen from each array.

3. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to k:**
   - The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - For each number `i`:
     - If `i` is found in both `a` and `b`, it checks which of `aOnes` and `bOnes` is smaller and increments that counter.
     - If `i` is only found in `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
     - If `i` is only found in `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
     - If neither condition is met (i.e., `i` is not found in either array or the counters are already at `newk`), it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if we can find the required elements from both arrays is correct.
- The loop ensures that we only increment the counters when necessary and stops early if it's impossible to meet the requirement.
- The final check at the end correctly determines if the conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from both arrays.

**Correctness: True**
