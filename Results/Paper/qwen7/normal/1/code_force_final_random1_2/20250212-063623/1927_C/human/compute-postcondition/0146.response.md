Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, `b` is assigned a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` sets the variable `bOnes` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `aOnes`, `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, and the second assignment to `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
