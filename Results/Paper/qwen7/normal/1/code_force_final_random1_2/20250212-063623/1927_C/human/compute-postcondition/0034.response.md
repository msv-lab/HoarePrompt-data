Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` remains unchanged and `bOnes` remains 0. Otherwise, if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` remains 0. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
