Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 1 or 0, `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk` (either 0 or incremented), `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` must be at least 1. The current value of `i` is present in the list `b` but may or may not be present in the list `a` based on the if condition.**
