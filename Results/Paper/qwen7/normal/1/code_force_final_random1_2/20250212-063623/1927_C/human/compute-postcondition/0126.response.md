Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 3, 2, or 1, `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk` (either 0 or incremented), `i` is 3, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` must be at least 3. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk`; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**
