Based on the initial state provided:

- `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, indicating that the value of `i` (which is `k + 1`) was found in both lists `a` and `b` up to `newk`.
- The loop has executed all iterations where `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

The `print('yes')` statement will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
