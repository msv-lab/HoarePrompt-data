Output State: **`aOnes` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1; `bOnes` is 1; `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Since `bOnes` was either 0 or 1 initially, incrementing it by 1 will make it 1. The other variables (`aOnes`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged according to the precondition.
