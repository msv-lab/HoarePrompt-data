Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the factorial precomputation and reads the number of test cases. It then processes each test case by reading the necessary parameters and indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

2. **Validation of Indices**: The program checks if the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums, and if the first index of prefix maximums is 1 and the last index of suffix maximums is the length of the permutation. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations**: The program uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of possible permutations. Specifically, it calculates combinations using the `func_1` and `func_2` functions, which are implemented correctly for handling large numbers using modular arithmetic.

4. **Combining Results**: The program combines the results of the combinatorial calculations by multiplying them together and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is done correctly, ensuring that the final result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately, such as when the indices do not match the expected pattern, and it correctly outputs 0 in such cases.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
