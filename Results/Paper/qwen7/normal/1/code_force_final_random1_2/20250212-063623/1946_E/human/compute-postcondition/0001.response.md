Output State: **The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then taken modulo 1000000007.**

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form (m1, m2, n).
- `c` is the result of calling the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.
- `d` is also the result of calling the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

The code snippet provided returns `c * a % 1000000007`. Since `c` is the result of the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, the program is essentially returning the product of `a` and `c`, modulo `1000000007`.
