Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the number of permutations that match given prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves calculating combinations and permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Factorials and Combinations**: The solution uses factorials to calculate combinations. This is necessary because the number of ways to arrange elements between certain indices can be calculated using combinations.
   - **Recursive Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It is used to compute modular inverses, which are needed for combination calculations.
   - **Combination Calculation**: The combination function `func_2` uses the GCD result to compute combinations efficiently under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Permutation Calculation**: The main logic iterates over the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums, applying combination and permutation rules to count valid permutations.

3. **Verification of Each Part**:
   - **Factorial Precomputation**: The factorials are precomputed up to \(2 \times 10^5\) to avoid repeated computation during the main loop.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse, which is essential for combination calculations.
   - **Combination Calculation**: The `func_2` function correctly computes combinations using the precomputed factorials and modular inverses.
   - **Main Logic**: The main logic correctly applies the combination and permutation rules to count valid permutations based on the given indices.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles edge cases such as when the last prefix maximum is not the same as the first suffix maximum, in which case no valid permutation exists.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, ensuring that the computations do not overflow and remain within the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
