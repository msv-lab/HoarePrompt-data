Output State: **The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Given the initial state, we know that `a` is a positive integer that is divisible by `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The expression `a // b` represents the integer division of `a` by `b`, which results in an integer quotient. 

Since `a` is divisible by `b`, the result of `a // b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (because `a` is at least `b`). Let's denote the result of `a // b` as `q`. Therefore, `q = a // b`.

The second part of the return statement is `-(a // b - 1)`, which simplifies to `-q + 1`. Since `q` is the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b`, and given that `a` is divisible by `b`, `q` is at least 1. Thus, `-q + 1` will be a non-positive integer.

In summary, the program returns a tuple containing `1` and a value that is `1` less than the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
