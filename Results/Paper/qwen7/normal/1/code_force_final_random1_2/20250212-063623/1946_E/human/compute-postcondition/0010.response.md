Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a % b` is not equal to 0, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a % b)[0]`, `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a % b)[1]`**.

This means that after executing the line of code `c, d = func_1(b, a % b)`, the variables `a` and `b` retain their initial conditions, while `c` and `d` are assigned the results returned by the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`.
