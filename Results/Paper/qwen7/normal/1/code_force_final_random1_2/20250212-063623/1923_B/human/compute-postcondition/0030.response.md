Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` subtracts `delta` from the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Given the initial conditions, `delta` was defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. After executing the code, `rest` is updated to `rest - 2*delta` because `delta` is recalculated as `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` after the subtraction. Also, `pos` is increased by 1 since it is mentioned that `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, and it cannot be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` anymore.
