Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from another input string split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remains unchanged. The new variable `x` is created and populated with integers from the new input string.
