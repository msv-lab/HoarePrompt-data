Output State: **`rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `rest` is decreased by the value of `delta`. The value of `delta` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. Therefore, after executing `rest -= delta`, the updated state of `rest` is `rest - delta`, while `delta` stays as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.
