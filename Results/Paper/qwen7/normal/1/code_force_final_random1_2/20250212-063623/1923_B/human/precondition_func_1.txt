t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each integer x_i satisfies -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
