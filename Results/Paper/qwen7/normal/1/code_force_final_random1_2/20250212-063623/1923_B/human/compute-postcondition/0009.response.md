Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `x` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from another input string using map and split functions.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The original values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new list `x` is updated with the integers from the new input string.
