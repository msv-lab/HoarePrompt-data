### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of firing bullets at monsters and checking if the player can survive.
   - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (point 0).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters until their health is depleted.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the player can fire up to `k` bullets per second and ensures that all monsters are defeated before they can reach the player.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the game rules.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, including the number of monsters (`n`), the number of bullets per second (`k`), the health of the monsters (`a`), and their initial positions (`x`).
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case to determine if the player can survive.
   - The function correctly prints 'YES' if the player can survive and 'NO' otherwise.
   - The logic in `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the process for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - Both functions together correctly implement the problem statement.
   - `func_1` accurately simulates the game mechanics and determines if the player can survive for a single test case.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the outcome for each test case.
   - The program handles all constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
