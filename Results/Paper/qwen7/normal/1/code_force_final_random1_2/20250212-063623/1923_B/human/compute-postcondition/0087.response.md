To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given postconditions.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
```

This means the loop continues as long as `rest` is not zero and `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Given Postconditions
- `rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`
- `pos` is increased by 1
- `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`
- `delta` is equal to `min(rest - 2*delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta)`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Rest Condition**: The loop continues as long as `rest != 0`. After the last iteration, `rest` was updated to `rest - 2*delta`. For the loop to continue, `rest` must still be non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `rest` is greater than 0.
2. **Pos Condition**: The loop continues as long as `pos != len(sorted_indices)`. After the last iteration, `pos` was increased by 1. For the loop to continue, `pos` must still be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Adjusted States
- `rest` must be greater than 0.
- `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Final Answer
State: **`rest` is greater than 0, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**
