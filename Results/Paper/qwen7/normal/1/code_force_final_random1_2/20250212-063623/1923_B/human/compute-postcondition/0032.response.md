Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. This holds true whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0 or not, as there is no else part that changes these conditions when the if condition is not met.
