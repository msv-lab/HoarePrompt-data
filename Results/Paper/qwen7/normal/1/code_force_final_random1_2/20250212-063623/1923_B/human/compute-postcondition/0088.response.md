Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.

Explanation: The variable `delta` is assigned the value of the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Since `rest` is greater than 0 and `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `delta` takes the value of the smaller of these two. After this assignment, `rest` is reduced by the value of `delta`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged, and the condition that `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)` still holds true.
