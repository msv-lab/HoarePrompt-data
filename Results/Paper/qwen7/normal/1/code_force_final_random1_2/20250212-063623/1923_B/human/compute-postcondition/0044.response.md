Output State: **`rest` is `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `rest` is `rest - delta`, and `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. The code snippet `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` means that the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. Since `delta` is already defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, after the operation, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will be reduced by `delta`. Additionally, since `rest` was initially `rest - delta`, and `delta` is now adjusted to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` (which is less than or equal to the original `delta`), `rest` effectively becomes `rest - 2*delta`.
