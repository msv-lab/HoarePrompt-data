To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

1. **Condition `rest != 0`:**
   - The postcondition tells us that `rest` is updated to `rest - 2*delta`.
   - For the loop to continue, `rest` must be non-zero after this update. This means `rest - 2*delta` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `rest` must be greater than `2*delta`.

2. **Condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`:**
   - The postcondition tells us that `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is set to 0 and `pos` is incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.
   - Therefore, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that both conditions are met for the loop to execute one more time. Specifically, we need to ensure that `rest > 2*delta` and `pos < len(sorted_indices)`.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `rest` must be greater than `2*delta`.
- `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

Therefore, the modified state should reflect these conditions.

**State:**
**`rest` is greater than `2*delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`**
