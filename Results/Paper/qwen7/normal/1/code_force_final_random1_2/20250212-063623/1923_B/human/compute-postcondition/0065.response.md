Output State: **`rest` is reduced to 0, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, and `distance` is increased by 1.**

This means that the `distance` variable has been incremented by 1 due to the addition operation in the code. All other conditions and states remain unchanged from the initial state, specifically, `rest` is now 0, `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, and all elements in the `a` array corresponding to indices in `sorted_indices` are set to 0.
