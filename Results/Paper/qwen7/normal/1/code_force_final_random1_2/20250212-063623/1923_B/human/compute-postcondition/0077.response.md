Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is increased by 2, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is decreased by `delta`. Additionally, the current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, and `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `rest` is still equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is now one more than its previous value (increased by 1), `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is still decreased by `delta`, and the current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains 0.
