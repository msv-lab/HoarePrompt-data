Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` to the variable `delta`. This means `rest` is decreased by the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The value of `pos` is also increased by 1, but the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not specified, so we only know it's the next element in the list `a` corresponding to the current index `pos`. The precondition that `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)` remains valid, but now `pos` is incremented.
