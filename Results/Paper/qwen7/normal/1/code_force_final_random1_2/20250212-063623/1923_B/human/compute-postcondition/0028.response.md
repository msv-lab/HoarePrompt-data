Output State: **`rest` is decreased by `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.**

This means that `delta` is assigned the value of the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The value of `rest` is decreased by this minimum value. The value of `pos` remains unchanged or increases by 1, and it does not become equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.
