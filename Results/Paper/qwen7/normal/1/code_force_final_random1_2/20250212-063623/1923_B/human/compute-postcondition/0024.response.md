Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k - 0`, `pos` is increased by 1, `delta` is equal to `0`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables (`rest`, `delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
