Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` before the operation.**

Explanation: The code decreases the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by `delta`. Before the operation, `delta` was defined as the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. After executing the code, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated by subtracting `delta` from its original value. The value of `rest` is also reduced by `delta`, and `delta` remains the minimum value between the new `rest` value and the updated `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` value.
