Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rest` is equal to `k`, `distance` is 0, `n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted by the absolute value of the corresponding elements in `x`, `pos` is equal to or greater than `len(sorted_indices)`, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `k` minus `2*delta`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `delta` is equal to `0`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `0`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `k - 0`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `delta` is equal to `0`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `0`, then `pos` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. This holds true whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0 or not, as there is no else part that changes these conditions when the if condition is not met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
