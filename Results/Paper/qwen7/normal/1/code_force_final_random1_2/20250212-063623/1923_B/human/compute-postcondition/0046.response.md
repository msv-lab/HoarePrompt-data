Output State: **`rest` is `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, the first element of `a` that was greater than or equal to `delta` and less than or equal to `rest - delta` is now 0, `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `pos` before the increment is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
