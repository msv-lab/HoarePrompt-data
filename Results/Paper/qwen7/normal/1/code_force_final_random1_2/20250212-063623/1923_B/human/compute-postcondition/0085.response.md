Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - 2*delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta)`.

This means that regardless of whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0 or not, after the if-else block executes, `rest` will be reduced by `2*delta`, `pos` will be incremented by 1, and `pos` will still be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`. Additionally, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will be decreased by `delta`, and `delta` will be updated to the minimum value between `rest - 2*delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.
