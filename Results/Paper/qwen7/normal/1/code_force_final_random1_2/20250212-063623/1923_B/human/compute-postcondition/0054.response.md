Postcondition: `rest` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` before the operation, and `pos` is increased by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not zero. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is zero, the values remain unchanged.
