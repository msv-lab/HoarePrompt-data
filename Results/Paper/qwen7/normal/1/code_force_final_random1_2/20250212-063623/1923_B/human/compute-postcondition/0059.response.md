Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta - delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The initial state is that `rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, and `delta` remains unchanged. The code snippet `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` decreases the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by `delta`. Since `rest` was already decreased by `delta`, it is further decreased by another `delta`, making it `rest - delta - delta`. The value of `delta` remains unchanged, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now reduced by `delta`.
