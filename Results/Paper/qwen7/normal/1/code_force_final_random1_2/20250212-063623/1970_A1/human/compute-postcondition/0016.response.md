Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `balance` is either 0 or -1; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being equal to the new value of `balance`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the second or third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance` was initially either 1 or 0, after decrementing, it will be either 0 (if it was initially 1) or -1 (if it was initially 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
