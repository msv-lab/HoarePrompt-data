Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to implement a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle involves sorting the characters based on their prefix balance and their position in descending order when the prefix balances are equal.

2. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Class Definition**: A class `BalanceInfo` is defined to store information about the balance, position, and character at each position in the input string.
   - **Main Function (`func_2`)**: 
     - It initializes the length of the input string `s` and creates a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It iterates through the string, updating the balance and appending corresponding `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
     - After processing the entire string, it sorts `balance_info` based on the specified criteria (prefix balance and position).
     - Finally, it constructs and prints the result by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for constructing and sorting the `balance_info` list is correct.
   - The sorting key ensures that characters are ordered first by their prefix balance and then by their position in descending order.
   - The construction of the result string from the sorted `balance_info` list is accurate.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
   - There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
