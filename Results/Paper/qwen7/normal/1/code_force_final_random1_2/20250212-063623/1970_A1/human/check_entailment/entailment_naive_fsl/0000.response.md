Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the `func_2` function sorts the balance information but does not ensure that the resulting sequence maintains the correct balance properties as described. 

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected output is `()(()())`, but the current implementation might produce an incorrect sequence because it does not properly handle the sorting and reassembly of the sequence to maintain the balance properties. The current implementation simply sorts the characters based on the computed balance and position, which may not always result in a valid balanced shuffle sequence.

To verify, let's manually check the steps for the input `(()(()))`:

1. Compute the balance and position for each character:
   ```
   Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3
   Position       | 1 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 6
   Character      | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ( | ) | )
   ```

2. Sort based on balance and position:
   ```
   Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3
   Position       | 1 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 6
   Character      | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ( | ) | )
   ```

3. The sorted characters form the sequence `()(()())`.

However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the sorting and reassembly process, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
