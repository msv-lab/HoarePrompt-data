Postcondition: `i` is 0, `balance` is either 0 or 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being an unspecified value, and `s[i]` is the first character of `s`. If `s[i]` is an opening parenthesis `(`, then `balance` is 1. Otherwise, `balance` is 0.
