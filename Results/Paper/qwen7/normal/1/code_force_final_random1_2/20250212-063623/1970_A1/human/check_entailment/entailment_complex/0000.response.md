Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their `balance` and `position` attributes. It correctly handles sorting criteria as specified in the problem statement. If the balances are different, it sorts by the difference in balances; otherwise, it sorts by the difference in positions. This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose in the overall logic.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: 
   - **Initialization**: The function starts by calculating the balance of the parentheses sequence and storing it in the `balance_info` list. This list contains `BalanceInfo` objects that store the balance, position, and character at each index of the input string.
   - **Sorting**: The `balance_info` list is sorted based on the balance and position using a lambda function. This ensures that the sequence is shuffled according to the rules provided in the problem statement.
   - **Result Construction**: After sorting, the function constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
   - **Output**: The result string is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

3. **Overall Program Logic**: 
   - The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
   - It processes the sequence to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It sorts this list based on the specified criteria.
   - It constructs and prints the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to perform the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
