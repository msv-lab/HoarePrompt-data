Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES'**.

This means that after executing the line `ans = 'YES'`, the variable `ans` is set to the string `'YES'`. All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
