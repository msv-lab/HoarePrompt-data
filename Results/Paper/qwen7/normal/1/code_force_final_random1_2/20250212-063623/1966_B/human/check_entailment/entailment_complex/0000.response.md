Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and the grid itself (`gr`).

2. **Initial Check**: The program starts by checking if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right cell (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If they are different, it immediately sets `ans` to 'NO' because it would be impossible to make all cells the same color if the corners are of different colors.

3. **Edge Case Checks**: 
   - If the top-left and bottom-right cells are different, the program further checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same. This is done by iterating through the first row and first column and checking if any cell differs from the first cell in its respective row or column.
   - Similarly, it checks if all cells in the last row and last column are the same.

4. **Conclusion**: If any of the checks fail, the program sets `ans` to 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make all cells the same color. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the program accurately reflects the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
