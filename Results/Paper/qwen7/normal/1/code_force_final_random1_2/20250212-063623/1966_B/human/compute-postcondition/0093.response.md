Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n - 1` must be true. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`.

3. **Update the State:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-2` (because `j` is `m-1` and the loop runs until `i` is less than `n-1`).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `n-1` and `n` must remain the same.

Given this, the updated state should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `n-1`**
