### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and change all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`, assuming it's possible to make all squares the same color initially.
   - It checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners of the grid have different colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the corners differ.
   - It then checks if the first row and the last column have alternating colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if there are alternating colors in the first row or the last column.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies situations where it's impossible to make all squares the same color:
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
     - However, the check for alternating colors in the first row and last column is flawed. The code only checks if the first and last elements of the first row and last column are different, but it doesn't account for the possibility of alternating patterns within those rows/columns.
   - For example, consider the following grid:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     ```
     The first row and last column do not have alternating colors, yet it is still possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners.
   - The current logic incorrectly sets `ans` to `'NO'` for grids like the one above, which should be `'YES'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code fails to correctly handle some edge cases where it's possible to make all squares the same color.
   - Specifically, the check for alternating colors in the first row and last column is insufficient and leads to incorrect results.
