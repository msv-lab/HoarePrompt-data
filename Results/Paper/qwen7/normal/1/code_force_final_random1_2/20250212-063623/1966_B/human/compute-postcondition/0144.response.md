Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1` at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `n - 1` is determined by the value of `n`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `n - 1` is a non-negative integer.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since `i` will be set to `n - 1` at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `n - 1` is a valid starting point for the loop.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n - 1` must be at least 2.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 (since `n - 1` must be at least 2).
   - The value of `i` will be `n - 1`, so we need to reflect this in the state.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` will be `n - 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`**.
