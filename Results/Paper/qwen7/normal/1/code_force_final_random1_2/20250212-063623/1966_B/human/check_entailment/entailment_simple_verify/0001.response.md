### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and change all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`, assuming it's possible to make all squares the same color initially.
   - It checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners of the grid have different colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the corners differ.
   - It then checks if the first row and the last column have alternating colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if there are alternating colors in the first row or the last column.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies situations where it's impossible to make all squares the same color:
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
     - However, the logic only checks the first row and the last column for alternating colors, which is insufficient. There could be other patterns in the grid that prevent making all squares the same color.
   - For example, consider a grid where the first row is `W B W B ...` and the last column is `W B W B ...`. This pattern would be missed by the current logic but is still impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - Additionally, the logic does not check if there are any other patterns in the grid that would prevent making all squares the same color, such as a checkerboard pattern.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code correctly identifies some cases where it's impossible to make all squares the same color, but it does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, the logic is incomplete and may incorrectly return `'YES'` for some grids that cannot be made uniform.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios where it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

### Final:
**False**
