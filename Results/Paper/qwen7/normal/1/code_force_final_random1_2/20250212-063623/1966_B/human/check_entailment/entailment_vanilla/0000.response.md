### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and change all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`, assuming it's possible to make all squares the same color initially.
   - It checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners of the grid have different colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the corners differ.
   - It then checks if the first row and the last column have alternating colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if there are alternating colors in the first row or the last column.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies situations where it's impossible to make all squares the same color:
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
     - If the first row or the last column have alternating colors, it's also impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - The logic correctly sets `ans` to `'NO'` in these cases and leaves it as `'YES'` otherwise.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
   - The code handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.
