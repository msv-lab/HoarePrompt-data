Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `tc` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
