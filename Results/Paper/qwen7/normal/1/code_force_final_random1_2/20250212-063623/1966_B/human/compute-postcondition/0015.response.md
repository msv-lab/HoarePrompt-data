Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, and the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr'.**

The code sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `impossible` and retains the values of all other variables as they were in the initial state.
