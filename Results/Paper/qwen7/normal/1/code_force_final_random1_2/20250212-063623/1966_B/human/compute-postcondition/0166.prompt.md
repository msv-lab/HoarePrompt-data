Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `gr` is a grid, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on whether `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO' and `i` is set to `n - 2`. If `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is 1, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations, `i` is `-1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, then `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, and `ans` is 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO', `impossible` is set to `True`, and `j` is set to `m - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
