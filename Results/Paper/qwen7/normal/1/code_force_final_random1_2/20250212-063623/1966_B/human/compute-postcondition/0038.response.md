Postcondition: `gr` is a grid, and `impossible` remains `False`. If the first element of row `i` is not equal to the first element of row `i + 1`, or the last element of row `i` is not equal to the last element of row `i + 1`, then `impossible` remains `False`. If none of these conditions are met, `impossible` still remains `False`.
