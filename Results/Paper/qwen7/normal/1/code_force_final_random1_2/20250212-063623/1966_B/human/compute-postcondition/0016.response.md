Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`. The loop will iterate from `0` to `m - 2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates values from `0` to `m - 2`).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` being `0`, we need to ensure that `j` is `0` at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < m - 1`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `m - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their initial states do not affect the loop execution. Hence, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be `0`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 0**
