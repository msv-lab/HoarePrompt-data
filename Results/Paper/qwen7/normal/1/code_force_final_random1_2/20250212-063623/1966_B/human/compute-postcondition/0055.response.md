The only variables in the loop head are `tc` and `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
- `gr` is a grid.
- `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on whether `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO' and `i` is set to `n - 2`.
- If `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` remains 'YES'.

Since the loop variable `tc` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop condition `tc < t` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

Given that the loop has just completed one iteration, `tc` would be 0 initially and is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `tc` will be 1.

The value of `t` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `t` stays the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before**
