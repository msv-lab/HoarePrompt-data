Output State: **`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` remains `False` if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged; `ans` is 'NO'**.

The variable `ans` is assigned the value 'NO', which does not affect the conditions of `j`, `m`, `impossible`, or the elements of `gr`. Therefore, those conditions remain unchanged.
