Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `m`. The original value of `tc` remains unchanged, and `n` and `m` are assigned the respective values from the input. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\) is not directly affected by this code snippet, so it is still valid but not explicitly mentioned in the output state.
