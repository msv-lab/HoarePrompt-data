Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range object defined by `range(n)`. 

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is currently `-1`.

3. **Understand the range function**: The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must iterate through these values.

4. **Initial value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `-1`, the first iteration of the loop will increment `i` to `0`. Therefore, `i` must be set to `0` at the start of the loop for the first iteration to occur.

5. **Condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` starts at `0`, the loop will execute if `n` is at least `1`.

6. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is `0` and `n` is at least `1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO'**
