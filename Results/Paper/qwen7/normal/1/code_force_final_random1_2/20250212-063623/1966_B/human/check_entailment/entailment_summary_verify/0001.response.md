### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and change all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`, assuming it's possible to make all squares the same color initially.
   - It checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners of the grid have different colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the corners differ.
   - It then checks if the first row and the last column have alternating colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if there are alternating colors in the first row or the last column.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies situations where it's impossible to make all squares the same color:
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
     - However, the logic incorrectly assumes that if the first row or the last column have alternating colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
       ```
       BB
       WW
       ```
       Here, the first row has alternating colors, but it's still possible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the following operations:
       - Select (1,1) and (1,2) to change the entire first row to 'B'.
       - Select (2,1) and (2,2) to change the entire second row to 'W'.
       - Select (1,1) and (2,1) to change the entire first column to 'B'.
       - Select (1,2) and (2,2) to change the entire second column to 'W'.
       - Finally, select (1,1) and (2,2) to change the entire grid to 'B'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code incorrectly identifies some cases where it's possible to make all squares the same color as impossible.
   - Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
