Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for tc in range(t)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 1
   - `t` remains the same (no change needed)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations
   - `i` is -1
   - `ans` is 'NO'

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `tc` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations, `i` is -1, `ans` is 'NO'**
