The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of a grid of up to 500x500 cells, where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they are different, it checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same, and if all cells in the last row and last column are the same. Based on these checks, it determines whether the grid meets certain conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
