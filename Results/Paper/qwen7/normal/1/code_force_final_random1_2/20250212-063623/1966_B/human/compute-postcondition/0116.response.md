Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `t` remains the same
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the append operation
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is 'NO'

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `tc` remains 2
- `t` remains the same
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `m` is an input integer
- `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the append operation
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is 'NO'

So, the final state is:

State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the append operation, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'NO'**
