Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing three elements which are the input from the user, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains two elements which are the input from the user. After executing the code, `gr` will now contain three elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
