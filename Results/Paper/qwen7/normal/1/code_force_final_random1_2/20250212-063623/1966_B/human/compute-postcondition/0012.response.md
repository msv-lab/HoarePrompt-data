Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES'**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state. The value of `tc` remains 1, `n` remains the input integer, `m` remains the input integer, `gr` remains a list of `n` elements (each being an input from the user), and `i` remains `n-1`.
