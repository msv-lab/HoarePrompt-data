Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list**
