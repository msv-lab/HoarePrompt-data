Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is not directly modified within the loop, so its value remains the same).
   - `m` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user (this variable is not directly modified within the loop, so its value remains the same).
   - `i` is 0 (at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer and is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `tc` remains 1.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `m` remains the same input integer.
- `gr` remains the same list.
- `i` is now 1.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `i` is 1**.
