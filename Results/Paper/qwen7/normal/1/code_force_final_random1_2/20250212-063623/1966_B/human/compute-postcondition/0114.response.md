Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `t` remains the same
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'NO'

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. After the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 0 (which it is, as stated).

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Final state**:
   - `tc` remains 2
   - `t` remains the same
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1
   - `m` remains the same
   - `gr` remains the same
   - `i` is now 1
   - `ans` remains 'NO'

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'NO'**
