Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `gr` now contains one element, which is the input provided by the user. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
