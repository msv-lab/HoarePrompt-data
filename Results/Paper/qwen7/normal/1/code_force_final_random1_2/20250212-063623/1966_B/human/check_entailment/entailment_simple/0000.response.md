Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid, and storing the grid itself.
3. The logic checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) cells are the same color. If they are different, it immediately sets the answer to 'NO' because no operations can make the entire grid uniform if the corners have different colors.
4. If the corners have the same color, it further checks if the first row and the last column are uniform. This is because if the first row or the last column has alternating colors, it would be impossible to make the entire grid uniform without affecting the corners.
5. If the first row or the last column are not uniform, it sets the answer to 'NO'.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is set to 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the entire grid uniform.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program handles all edge cases and follows the rules specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
