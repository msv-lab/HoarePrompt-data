Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `j`, and the condition for the loop to continue is `j < m - 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `impossible` remains `False` if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `m` must remain greater than 2.
   - The value of `impossible` will depend on the conditions mentioned. Since `j` is now 2, we need to check the conditions for `impossible` again. However, the conditions for `impossible` are based on the elements of `gr`, which are not changed by the loop itself. Therefore, the value of `impossible` remains as it was in the previous iteration unless the conditions are met.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `impossible` remains `False` if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.**
