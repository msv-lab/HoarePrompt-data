Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 'NO'` changes the value of the variable `ans` from `'YES'` to `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
