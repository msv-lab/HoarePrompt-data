Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements which are the input from the user, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element, which is the first input from the user. After executing the code, `gr` will contain two elements: the first input and the second input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
