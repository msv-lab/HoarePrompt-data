Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'YES', and the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr` with the indices adjusted as `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `impossible` is set to `False`. Additionally, the condition `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` holds true for some `j` in the range of the lists.**

The code simply sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
