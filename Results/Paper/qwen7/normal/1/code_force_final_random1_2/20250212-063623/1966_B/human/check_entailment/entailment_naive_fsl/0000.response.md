Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the grid can still be made uniform but the program incorrectly determines it as impossible. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BWW
WWB
BWW
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it checks only the corners and adjacent cells in the first row and column. However, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 1) to color all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 1) to the same color.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) to color all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 2) to (3, 2) to the same color.

After these operations, all squares will be the same color. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly and should return "YES".
