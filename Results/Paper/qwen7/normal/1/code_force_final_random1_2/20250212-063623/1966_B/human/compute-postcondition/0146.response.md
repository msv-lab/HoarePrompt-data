Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`. Additionally, the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]` or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`.
