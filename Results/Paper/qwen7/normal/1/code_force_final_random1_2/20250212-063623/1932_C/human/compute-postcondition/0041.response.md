Output State: **The program returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.**

This means that after the loop completes, the list `ans` will contain the final value of `p` repeated `n` times. Since the function returns `reversed(ans)`, the output will be a list of length `n` where each element is the final value of `p`, but in reverse order compared to how they were originally added to `ans`.
