Output State: `b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the first element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m` (where `v` is the first element of `b`), `ans` is a list containing all elements from `p` repeated `n` times.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be the first element of the list `b` because the loop iterates over `b` in reverse order. The variable `p` will be updated `n` times, each time multiplying the current value of `p` by the next element in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Since `p` starts as 1 and gets updated in each iteration, by the end of the loop, `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`. This final value of `p` is appended to `ans` in each iteration, resulting in a list where every element is equal to the final value of `p`.
