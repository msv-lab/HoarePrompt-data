Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'L'; `b` is a list with one additional element appended from `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. However, the values of `i`, `n`, and the character at index `i` of `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
