You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1

- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of length `n`. For each index `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, if `s[j]` is 'L', then `b[j]` is equal to `a[l + j]`, otherwise `b[j]` is equal to `a[r - j]`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the first element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m` (where `v` is the first element of `b`), `ans` is a list containing all elements from `p` repeated `n` times.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be the first element of the list `b` because the loop iterates over `b` in reverse order. The variable `p` will be updated `n` times, each time multiplying the current value of `p` by the next element in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Since `p` starts as 1 and gets updated in each iteration, by the end of the loop, `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`. This final value of `p` is appended to `ans` in each iteration, resulting in a list where every element is equal to the final value of `p`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` of commands.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the corresponding element (leftmost or rightmost) to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program reverses the list `b` to start calculating the product from the last command.
   - It initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over the reversed list `b`, updating `p` with the product modulo `m` and appending the result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed `ans` which gives the correct order of remainders as required.
4. **Output**:
   - The main loop correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
