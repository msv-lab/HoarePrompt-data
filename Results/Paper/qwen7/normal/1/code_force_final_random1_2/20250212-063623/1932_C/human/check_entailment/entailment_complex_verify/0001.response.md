### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` of commands. This part of the assessment is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization and Pointer Management**:
     - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
     - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`. These pointers are updated correctly based on the commands in `s`. This part of the assessment is correct.
   - **Product Calculation**:
     - The function reverses the list `b` to start calculating the product from the last command. However, the logic for calculating the product modulo `m` is flawed.
     - The variable `p` is initialized to 1 and iterates over the reversed list `b`, updating `p` with the product modulo `m` and appending the result to `ans`. This part of the assessment is incorrect because the product calculation should be done in the original order of commands, not in reverse order.
     - Specifically, the product calculation should be done in the order of the commands as they appear in `s`, not in reverse. The current implementation calculates the product of the remaining elements in reverse order, which is incorrect.

3. **Output**:
   - The main loop correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results. However, since the product calculation is incorrect, the output will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The product calculation in the function `func_1` is performed in reverse order, which does not match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
