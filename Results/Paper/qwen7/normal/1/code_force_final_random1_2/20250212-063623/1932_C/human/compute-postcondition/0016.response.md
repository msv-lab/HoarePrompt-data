Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with one additional element from `a[r]`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state of `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is a list with one additional element from `a[r]`, these values remain unchanged except for `r`, which is now `r - 1`.
