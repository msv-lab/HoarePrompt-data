Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` of commands.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the corresponding element (leftmost or rightmost) to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program reverses the list `b` to start calculating the product from the last command.
   - It initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over the reversed list `b`, updating `p` with the product modulo `m` and appending the result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed `ans` which gives the correct order of remainders as required.
4. **Output**:
   - The main loop correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
