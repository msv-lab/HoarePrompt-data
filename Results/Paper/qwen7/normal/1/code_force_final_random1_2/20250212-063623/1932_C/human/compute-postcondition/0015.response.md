Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with one additional element from `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends an element from the list `a` at index `r` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact values or definitions of `a` and `r`. Since `i` and `n` remain unchanged, they are still `1` and a positive integer, respectively. The only change is that `b` now contains one more element than before, which is the element from `a[r]`.
