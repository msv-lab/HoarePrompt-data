#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of length `n`. For each index `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, if `s[j]` is 'L', then `b[j]` is equal to `a[l + j]`, otherwise `b[j]` is equal to `a[r - j]`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the first element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m` (where `v` is the first element of `b`), `ans` is a list containing all elements from `p` repeated `n` times.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be the first element of the list `b` because the loop iterates over `b` in reverse order. The variable `p` will be updated `n` times, each time multiplying the current value of `p` by the next element in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Since `p` starts as 1 and gets updated in each iteration, by the end of the loop, `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`. This final value of `p` is appended to `ans` in each iteration, resulting in a list where every element is equal to the final value of `p`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` based on the values in `a` and the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`, storing this value in `p`. Finally, it creates a list `ans` where each element is the final value of `p`, and returns this list in reversed order.
