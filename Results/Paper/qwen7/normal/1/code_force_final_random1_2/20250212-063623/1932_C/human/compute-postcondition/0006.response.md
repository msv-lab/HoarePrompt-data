Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; the current value of `s[i]` is 'L'; `b` is a list with one element which is `a[l]`; `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `i`, `n`, `s`, and `b` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `n` remains a positive integer, the current value of `s[i]` is still 'L', and `b` is still a list with one element which is `a[l]`. The only change is that `l` is now increased by 1.
