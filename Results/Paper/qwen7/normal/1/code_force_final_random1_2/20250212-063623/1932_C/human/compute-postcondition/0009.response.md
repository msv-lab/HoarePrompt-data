Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'L'; `b` is a list with one additional element appended from `a[r]`; `r` is decremented by 1.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `r`.
