Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly processes the commands as specified in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` based on the direction specified in `s` by moving from the left (`L`) or right (`R`) end of the array `a`.
3. After constructing `b`, the program calculates the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m` and stores this value in `p`.
4. The result `p` is appended to the list `ans` before updating `p` with the next element's value, ensuring that the final value of `p` is the product of all remaining elements in `b` modulo `m`.
5. The list `ans` is returned in reversed order, which matches the requirement to output the results in the order of command execution.

Given the execution summary and the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
