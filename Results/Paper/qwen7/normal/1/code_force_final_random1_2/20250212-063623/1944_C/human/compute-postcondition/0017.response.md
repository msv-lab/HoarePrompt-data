Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given that `start` is 1, `start + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `nums[2]` is decreased by 1. The values of `start` and the set `vis` remain unchanged.
