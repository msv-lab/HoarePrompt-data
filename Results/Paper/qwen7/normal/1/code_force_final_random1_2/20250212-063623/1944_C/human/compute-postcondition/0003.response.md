Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a non-zero value.
   - Since `start` is currently 0, we need to check if `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a non-zero value.
   - If `nums.get(0, 0)` returns 0, the loop will not execute the first time. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a non-zero value.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero. This can be achieved by setting `nums[0]` to any non-zero value.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a non-zero value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 0, `vis` is an empty set, and `nums[0]` must be a non-zero value**
