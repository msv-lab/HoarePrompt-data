### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game correctly and simply finds the smallest missing number in the array, which is not the same as the MEX of the sequence `c`. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to her list `c`, then removing it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1` is supposed to find and print the smallest index `start` such that `start + 1` is not present in the array.
- The function does not return any value.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a counter (`nums`) to count occurrences of each number in the array.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program enters a loop where it checks if `start` is present in the array.
   - If `start` is present, it marks it as visited and decrements its count.
   - If `start + 1` is also present, it processes `start + 1` instead.
   - If neither `start` nor `start + 1` is present, it prints `start + 1` and returns.

#### Correctness Check
1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Alice and Bob's actions need to be simulated correctly.
   - Alice should append elements to `c` and remove them from `a`.
   - Bob should only remove elements from `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, and Bob should minimize it.
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate these actions; it simply finds the smallest missing number in the array.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate the game correctly. It does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
   - It does not maintain the state of the array `a` and the list `c` as required by the game rules.

#### Example Verification
- Consider the example given:
  - Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `2`

The correct sequence of moves would be:
1. Alice picks 1, `c = [1]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
2. Bob picks 0, `a = [0, 1]`.
3. Alice picks 0, `c = [1, 0]`, `a = [1]`.
4. Bob picks 1, `a = []`.

Final `c = [1, 0]`, MEX = 2.

However, the provided code does not simulate the game correctly. It simply finds the smallest missing number in the array, which is not the same as the MEX of the sequence `c`.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly simulate the game and does not compute the MEX of the sequence `c` as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate.
