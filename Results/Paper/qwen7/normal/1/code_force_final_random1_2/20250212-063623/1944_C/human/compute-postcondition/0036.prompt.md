You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\) (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is 4, `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and `nums[4]` is either 0 or None (since it was decremented by 1 during the last iteration and the loop condition no longer holds).
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `start` would be incremented to 4 because the loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy. Since we know from the given conditions that the loop runs exactly 4 times, `start` will be 4 at the end. The set `vis` contains all indices from 0 to 3 because each index was visited exactly once. Finally, `nums[4]` is either 0 or None because it was decremented by 1 during the last iteration, and the loop condition `nums.get(start, 0)` becomes false, causing the loop to terminate.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: 4
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and performs operations on it without returning any result.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
