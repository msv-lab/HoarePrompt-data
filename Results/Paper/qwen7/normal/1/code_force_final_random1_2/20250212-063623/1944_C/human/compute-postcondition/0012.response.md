Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is a set containing 0.
   - `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`, meaning the value at index 0 of the `nums` list is decremented by 1.
   - `nums[start + 1]` is 0, meaning the value at index 1 of the `nums` list is 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet is `print(start + 1)`.
   - Since `start` is 0, `start + 1` evaluates to 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the integer 1.

Output: **1**
