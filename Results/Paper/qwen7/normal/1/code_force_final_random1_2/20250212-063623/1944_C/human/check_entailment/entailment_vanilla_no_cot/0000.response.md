Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for the game described. The function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required by the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be trying to find the minimum excluded value by marking numbers as visited and decrementing their counts, which is not aligned with the game rules.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob optimally. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Alice's Turn**: Alice will always pick the smallest available number to ensure that the MEX (Minimum Excludant) is maximized.
2. **Bob's Turn**: Bob will always pick the largest available number to minimize the MEX.

Given these rules, we can simulate the game by sorting the array and then alternately picking the smallest and largest remaining elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    
    mex = 0
    while arr:
        # Alice's turn: pick the smallest element
        if arr:
            mex = max(mex, arr.pop(0))
        
        # Bob's turn: pick the largest element
        if arr:
            mex = max(mex, arr.pop())
    
    print(mex)
```

This code correctly simulates the turns of Alice and Bob and calculates the MEX of the resulting array `c` after the game ends.
