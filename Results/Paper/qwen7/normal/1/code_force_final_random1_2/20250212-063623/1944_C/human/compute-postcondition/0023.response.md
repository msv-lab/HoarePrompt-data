Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `nums[start]` is not zero.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is 2, and `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1. Additionally, the postcondition states that if `nums[start + 1]` is not None and greater than 0, then `nums[start + 1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the function returns None.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `nums[start]` must be non-zero. Since `start` is currently 2, the next check will be `nums[2]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: We need to ensure that `nums[2]` is non-zero so that the loop can continue. If `nums[2]` is zero, the loop would terminate. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums[2]` is non-zero.

5. **Conclusion**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `nums[2]` to ensure it is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 2; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[2]` must be non-zero**
