### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not simulate the game properly and does not compute the MEX of the sequence `c`. Let's break down the issues and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Game Mechanics:**
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
   - Alice should append elements to her list `c` and remove them from `a`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.

2. **Incorrect Computation of MEX:**
   - The program attempts to find the smallest missing number in the array, which is not the same as the MEX of the sequence `c`.
   - The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game as described:
1. Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a`.
2. Alice appends the picked element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
3. Bob removes the picked element from `a`.
4. The game ends when `a` is empty.
5. Compute the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

#### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would involve maintaining two separate lists: one for Alice's picks and one for Bob's picks. However, the provided code does not simulate these steps accurately.

#### Detailed Analysis of Provided Code

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the array and compute the MEX.
   - The function uses a counter (`nums`) to count occurrences of each number in the array.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program enters a loop where it checks if `start` is present in the array.
   - If `start` is present, it marks it as visited and decrements its count.
   - If `start + 1` is also present, it processes `start + 1` instead.
   - If neither `start` nor `start + 1` is present, it prints `start + 1` and returns.

#### Verification with Examples

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Correct Sequence:
     1. Alice picks 1, `c = [1]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
     2. Bob picks 0, `a = [0, 1]`.
     3. Alice picks 0, `c = [1, 0]`, `a = [1]`.
     4. Bob picks 1, `a = []`.
   - Final `c = [1, 0]`, MEX = 2.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Correct Sequence:
     1. Alice picks 0, `c = [0]`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
     2. Bob picks 1, `a = [2, 3]`.
     3. Alice picks 2, `c = [0, 2]`, `a = [3]`.
     4. Bob picks 3, `a = []`.
   - Final `c = [0, 2]`, MEX = 1.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 2`, `arr = [1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Correct Sequence:
     1. Alice picks 1, `c = [1]`, `a = [1]`.
     2. Bob picks 1, `a = []`.
   - Final `c = [1]`, MEX = 0.

The provided code does not simulate the game correctly and does not compute the MEX of the sequence `c` as required. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game mechanics and does not compute the MEX of the sequence `c` as required.
