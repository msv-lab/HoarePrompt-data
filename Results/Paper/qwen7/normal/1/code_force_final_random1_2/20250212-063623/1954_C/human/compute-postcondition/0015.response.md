Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `new[i-1]` is the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, the current value of `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, `new[i-1]` (which corresponds to the previous value of `i`) is now set to the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
