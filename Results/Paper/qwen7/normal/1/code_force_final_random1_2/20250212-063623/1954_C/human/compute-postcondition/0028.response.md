The only variable in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**
