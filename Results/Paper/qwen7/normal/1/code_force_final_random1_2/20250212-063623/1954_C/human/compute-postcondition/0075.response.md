Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `i` is equal to `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `new2[i]` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. It also increments `i` by 2. The initial state of `new` being updated such that `new[i]` is equal to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`.
