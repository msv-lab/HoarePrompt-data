Functionality: **The function processes multiple pairs of integer strings (x and y) of the same length. For each pair, it creates two lists: `new` and `new2`. `new` contains the minimum values of the corresponding elements in `x` and `y` across all pairs, while `new2` contains the maximum values. After processing all pairs, it prints the contents of `new` and `new2` as strings.**
