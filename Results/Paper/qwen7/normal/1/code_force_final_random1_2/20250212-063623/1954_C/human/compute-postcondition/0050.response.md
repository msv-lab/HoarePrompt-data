Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` is a list of integers created from the input string; `new` is a list of length `len(a)` with `new[0]` being `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest of the elements being `None`; `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` with `new2[0]` being `min(a[0], b[0])` and the rest of the elements being `None`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `b`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
