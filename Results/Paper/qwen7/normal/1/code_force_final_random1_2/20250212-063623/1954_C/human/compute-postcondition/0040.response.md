Based on the initial state provided:

- `new` contains the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- `new2` contains the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

This statement joins all elements in `new2` into a single string, converting each element to a string first.

Given that `new2` contains the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and since the loop has processed all elements, `new2` must contain the maximum values from the pairs of elements in `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of the maximum values from the pairs of elements in `a` and `b`, concatenated together.

Output: **a string of the maximum values from the pairs of elements in `a` and `b` concatenated together**
