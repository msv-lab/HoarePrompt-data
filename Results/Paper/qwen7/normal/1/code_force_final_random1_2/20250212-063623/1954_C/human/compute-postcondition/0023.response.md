Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `new2[i-1]` is the minimum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state indicates that `new2[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` is used in the context of the list `new2`, making it `new2[i-1]` which is the minimum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`.
