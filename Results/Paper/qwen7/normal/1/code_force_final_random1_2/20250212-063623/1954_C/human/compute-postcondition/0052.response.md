Output State: **`i` is 1; `new[1]` is equal to `max(a[1], b[1])`; `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, `new[1]` will be set to the maximum of these two equal values, which is simply the value of `a[1]` (or `b[1]`). The values of `i` and the relationship between `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged.
