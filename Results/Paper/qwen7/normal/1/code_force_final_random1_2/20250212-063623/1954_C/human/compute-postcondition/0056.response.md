Output State: **`i` is 3 or higher; `len(a)` is such that `i` can still be less than it; `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`; `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 3 or higher, and `len(a)` is such that `i` can still be less than it, the length of `a` is sufficient to access `a[i]`. Since `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, when `i` is 3, `new[3]` will be assigned the maximum of `a[3]` and `b[3]`, which is `a[3]` (or `b[3]`). For other values of `i` (higher than 3), `new[i]` will be assigned the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
