Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `len(a) - 1` to `len(a)`. All other variables (`b`, `new`, and `new2`) remain unchanged.
