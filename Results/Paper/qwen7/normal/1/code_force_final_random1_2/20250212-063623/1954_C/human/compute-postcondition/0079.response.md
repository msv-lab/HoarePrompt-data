Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`**.

Explanation: After the if-else block executes, the variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The lists `b`, `new`, and `new2` will be fully populated according to the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, `new` will contain the maximum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` where `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])` since `i` will be equal to `len(a)` when the loop ends. Similarly, `new2` will contain the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` where `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`. The final value of `new2[i]` will be `max(a[i], b[i])`, as per the last assignment in the loop.
