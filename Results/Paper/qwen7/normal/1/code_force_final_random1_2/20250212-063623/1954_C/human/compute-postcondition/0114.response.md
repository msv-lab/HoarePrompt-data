Output State: **`i` is `len(a)` + 1, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for the indices `j` where `a[j]` equals `b[j]`, and `None` otherwise, and the last element is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, and `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])`, and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` was initially set to `len(a)`. After executing `i += 1`, `i` is now `len(a) + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
