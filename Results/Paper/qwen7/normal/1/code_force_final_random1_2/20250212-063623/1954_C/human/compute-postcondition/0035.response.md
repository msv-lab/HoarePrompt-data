The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `new2[i]` is updated to `max(a[i], b[i])`.

Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `new2[i]` is updated to `max(a[i], b[i])`.**
