Output State: **`i` is 4 or higher; `len(a)` is such that `i` can still be less than it; `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`; `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 3 or higher, after incrementing, `i` is now 4 or higher. All other conditions and equalities remain unchanged.
