State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, input must provide a valid integer**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
- The loop's condition depends on the input provided by the user, which must be a valid integer. This integer will determine how many times the loop will execute.
- Since `x` and `y` are already defined and do not affect the loop's execution condition, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that the input provided is a valid integer, which will control the number of iterations of the loop.
