Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the condition `i < len(a)`. This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of list `a`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(a) + 1`.
   - `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for the indices `j` where `a[j]` equals `b[j]`, and `None` otherwise, and the last element is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`.
   - `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.
   - `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])`, and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.

3. **Determine the adjustment needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Currently, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, which means the condition `i < len(a)` is false.
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`**
