Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for the indices `j` where `a[j]` equals `b[j]`, and `None` otherwise, and the last element is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, and `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])`, and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been completed. The list `new2` will contain the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` where the elements are equal, and `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`. Additionally, `new2[i]` will be the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `new` will contain the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`.
