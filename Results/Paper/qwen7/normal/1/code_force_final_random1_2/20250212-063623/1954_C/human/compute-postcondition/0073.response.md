Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while i < len(a)`.
- We need to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is equal to `i + 1`: This means that `i` has been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
- `b` is a list of integers created from the input string.
- `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the second last element being `max(a[i], b[i])` and the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`.
- `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the second last element being `min(a[i], b[i])` and the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`.
- `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

### Current State of `i`:
- After the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `i + 1`.
- Therefore, `i` is now `i + 1`.

### Determining the Next State:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
- Since `i` is now `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(a)`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be set to `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < len(a)`.

### Final State:
- The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop condition is met.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is equal to `i + 2` (to ensure `i + 1 < len(a)`)**

This ensures that `i` is incremented by 1 again and the loop condition `i < len(a)` is satisfied for the next iteration.
