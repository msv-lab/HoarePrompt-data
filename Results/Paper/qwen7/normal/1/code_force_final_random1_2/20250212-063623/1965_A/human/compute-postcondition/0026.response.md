Output State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False.

Explanation: The loop runs until the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, which happens on the second iteration with `set_` containing at least two elements including 1 and 2. After the second iteration, the loop breaks because the condition is satisfied, making `not_c` False. Since the loop variable `A` is toggled (`not A`) in each iteration and it starts as `False`, after the second iteration (and thus three total iterations), `A` becomes `True`. The value of `arr[0]` remains unchanged at 1, and `set_` must include at least 1 and 2. The value of `not_c` remains False as the loop breaks when the condition is met.
