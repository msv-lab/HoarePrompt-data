Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(1, len(lis))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1 (since `range(1, len(lis))` generates values starting from 1).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `len(lis)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` must be set to 1 initially.
   - `j` must be less than `len(lis)` for the loop to continue executing.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be set to 1.
- `j` must be less than `len(lis)` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `j` is 1, `j` must be less than `len(lis)`**
