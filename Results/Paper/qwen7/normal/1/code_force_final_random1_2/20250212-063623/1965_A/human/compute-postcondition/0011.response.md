Output State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1, 2], `not_c` is False, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
