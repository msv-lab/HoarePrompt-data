Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(set_) - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `A` is False.
   - `arr[0]` is 1.
   - `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2.
   - The condition to break out of the loop is if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than the current value of `i` in the loop.
   - Since the loop starts from `1`, if the loop has just finished an iteration, `i` was `1` (because it would have incremented from `0`).

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `i` will now be `2` because the loop will increment `i` by `1` in the next iteration.
   - `set_` must still contain at least two elements including 1 and 2.
   - The condition to break out of the loop remains the same.

5. **Final State:**
   - `A` remains `False` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `arr[0]` remains `1` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `set_` must still contain at least two elements including 1 and 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be `2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `i` is 2**
