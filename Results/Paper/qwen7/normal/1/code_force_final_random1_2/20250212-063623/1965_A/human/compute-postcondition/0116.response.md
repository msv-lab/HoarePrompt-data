Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variable `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = len(lis) - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j < len(lis)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `test` is False
   - The length of `lis` is at least 2

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since the loop starts from `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lis)`. Given that `j` is currently 1 and the length of `lis` is at least 2, the loop will execute again with `j = 2`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `test` remains unchanged (it is still False).
   - The length of `lis` remains unchanged (it is still at least 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `test` is False, and the length of `lis` is at least 2**
