Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is equal to the length of `lis`.
- `test` is `True`.
- The loop has either printed 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`.
- The length of `lis` is odd.

Given these conditions, we need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print('Alice')` is executed.

Since the length of `lis` is odd, `j` will be an even number (because it equals the length of `lis` and the length is odd). The loop condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` must have evaluated to `False` for all iterations up to the last one, because if it had evaluated to `True` for any iteration, the loop would have printed 'Bob' instead of 'Alice'. Therefore, the loop must have printed 'Alice' because the condition was never met to print 'Bob'.

Thus, the statement `print('Alice')` will simply print the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
