Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(1, len(lis))`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(lis))`. This means `j` should start from 1 and go up to but not including `len(lis)`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object of integers split from the input.
   - `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`.
   - `test` is True.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1, we need to ensure that `j` is initially set to 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(lis)`. Therefore, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be set to 1.
- `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `test`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 1, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1**
