You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, arr[0] is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs until the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, which happens on the second iteration with `set_` containing at least two elements including 1 and 2. After the second iteration, the loop breaks because the condition is satisfied, making `not_c` False. Since the loop variable `A` is toggled (`not A`) in each iteration and it starts as `False`, after the second iteration (and thus three total iterations), `A` becomes `True`. The value of `arr[0]` remains unchanged at 1, and `set_` must include at least 1 and 2. The value of `not_c` remains False as the loop breaks when the condition is met.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns 'Alice' in both cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
