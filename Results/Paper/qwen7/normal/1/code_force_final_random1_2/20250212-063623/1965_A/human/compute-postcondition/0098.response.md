Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the new input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`**.

Explanation: The code `l = map(int, input().split())` takes a new input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. This results in `l` being a map object containing these integers. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `lis` remain unchanged.
