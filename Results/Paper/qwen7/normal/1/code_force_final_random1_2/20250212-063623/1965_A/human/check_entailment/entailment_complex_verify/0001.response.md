### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - The result of `func_1(arr)` is printed.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes an array `arr` representing the sizes of the piles.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If it does, Alice wins immediately because she can remove one stone from each pile, making all piles have one stone, and then Bob will be forced to remove one stone from each pile, eventually leaving Alice with the last move.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, it proceeds to check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
     - If any difference is greater than 1, it means the piles are not all equal, and the game state is such that Bob can force a win.
     - Otherwise, it toggles a boolean `A` based on the parity of the number of unique pile sizes.
       - If the number of unique pile sizes is odd, `A` is `True`.
       - If the number of unique pile sizes is even, `A` is `False`.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The logic for checking if the smallest pile has more than one stone is correct. This condition directly determines the winner without further processing.
   - **Example:** For the input `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the smallest pile has 3 stones, so Alice wins immediately.

2. **Unique Pile Sizes Check:**
   - The logic for checking the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes is correct. If any difference is greater than 1, it means the piles are not all equal, and the game state is such that Bob can force a win.
   - However, the current implementation of this check is flawed. The function sorts the unique pile sizes and then checks the differences. This approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules.
   - **Example:** For the input `[1, 7]`, the smallest pile has 1 stone, and the only unique pile size is 1. The function should return 'Alice', but the current implementation incorrectly returns 'Bob'.
   - **Example:** For the input `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`, the smallest pile has 1 stone, and the unique pile sizes are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 100]`. The differences are all greater than 1, so the function should return 'Bob', but it incorrectly returns 'Alice'.

3. **Final Winner Determination:**
   - The final determination of the winner based on the value of `A` is correct. If `A` is `True`, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - However, due to the flaw in the unique pile sizes check, the final determination is incorrect in many cases.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The current implementation incorrectly handles the unique pile sizes check, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
