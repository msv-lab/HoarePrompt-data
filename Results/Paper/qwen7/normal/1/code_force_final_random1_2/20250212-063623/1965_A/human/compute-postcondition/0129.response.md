Output State: **`j` is 3, `test` remains False**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `test`. Since the initial state of `test` was `False`, it remains unchanged. The value of `j` is also unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `j` and `test`.
