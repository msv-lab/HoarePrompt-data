Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the new input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`, `test` is True.**

The code `test = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `test`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `test` being set to `True`.
