Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles.
2. The provided code reads input and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case.
3. The function `func_1` checks if the first element of the array is not 1. If true, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
4. If the first element is 1, it creates a sorted list of unique elements from the array.
5. It then iterates through this list to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1. If such a pair is found, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks out of the loop.
6. The boolean variable `A` is toggled in each iteration.
7. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.

The logic in `func_1` is designed to mimic the game's rules and correctly determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves that can be made when the smallest pile is 1. This approach is correct because:
- If the smallest pile is 1, the player whose turn it is can always reduce all piles to 0 by removing 1 stone from each pile, thus winning the game.
- The function correctly toggles `A` based on whether there are gaps larger than 1 between the sizes of the piles, which helps determine the optimal strategy.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the provided code correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
