Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`, `test` is True.**

The code `test = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `test`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, or `lis`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
