Output State: **`freq` is a list of 7 elements representing the count of characters from 'A' to 'G', `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`, `results` is a list with three elements, the first two are equal to the final value of `missing`, and the third element is also equal to the final value of `missing`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current value of `missing` to the `results` list. Since `missing` is already defined and its value is known (it is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`), appending it to `results` does not change its value. Therefore, the `results` list now has three elements, all of which are equal to the final value of `missing`. The `freq` and `missing` variables retain their initial conditions and values.
