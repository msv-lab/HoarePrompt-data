Output State: The `freq` list will contain the count of each letter (from A to G) in the string `a`. The `missing` variable will be updated based on the final values in `freq`, and the `results` list will have its first two elements set to the final value of `missing`, and the third element also set to the final value of `missing`.

In more detail:
- The `freq` list will have its elements incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding letter in the string `a`.
- The `missing` variable will be recalculated as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in the `freq` list.
- The `results` list will have its first two elements set to the final value of `missing`, and the third element also set to the final value of `missing`.
