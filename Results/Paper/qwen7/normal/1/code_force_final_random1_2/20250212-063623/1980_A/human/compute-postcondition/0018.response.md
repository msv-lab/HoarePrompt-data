Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `prob` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `freq` is given as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `missing` is defined as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`.
   - `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the value of `missing`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `a` is the iterable in the loop, it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `freq`, `missing`, and `results` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should remain consistent with their definitions.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the state of `a` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `a` must contain at least one element.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
