Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input.
2. For each test case, the program initializes a frequency array to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
3. It then iterates through the string of problem difficulties, updating the frequency array.
4. After counting the frequencies, it calculates how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement for the next `m` rounds. This is done by subtracting the current frequency from `m` for each difficulty level and taking the maximum of 0 and the result (to handle cases where the current frequency is already greater than or equal to `m`).
5. The sum of these values gives the total number of additional problems needed for that test case.
6. The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
