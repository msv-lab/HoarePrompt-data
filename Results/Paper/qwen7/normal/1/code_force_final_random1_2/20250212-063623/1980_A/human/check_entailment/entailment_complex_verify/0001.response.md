### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes `t` and `test_cases` with predefined values, simulating multiple test cases. This part is accurate.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.
     - It takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
     - For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level using a list `freq`.
     - It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the available problems (`f`).
     - The sum of these missing problems is appended to the `results` list.
   - The function logic is sound and correctly implements the problem's requirements.

3. **Output**:
   - The program iterates over the `results` list and prints each value, which matches the expected output format. This part is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `m` might be greater than the number of problems available for a particular difficulty level. The logic correctly calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level and sums them up.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program correctly simulates the problem scenario and produces the expected output for the given examples. The logic is consistent and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. The function handles all aspects of the problem description and produces the correct output.

### Final:
**True**
