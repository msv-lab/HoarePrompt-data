Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `prob` which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `prob` will take on the values from the list `a` one by one.
   - `a` is assigned the value from `test_cases[_]`.
   - `freq` is a list of 7 zeros and is not involved in the loop head.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - When the loop starts, `prob` will be the first element of `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `prob` will be the first element of `a` when the loop starts, `a` must contain at least one element.
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `freq`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `a` must have at least one element.

**State:**
**`a` must have at least one element**
