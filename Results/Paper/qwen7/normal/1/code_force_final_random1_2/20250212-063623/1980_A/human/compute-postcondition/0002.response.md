Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer, but we need to explicitly state that `t` must be at least 1.

4. **Consider other objects**: The objects `results`, `test_cases`, and the loop body itself (`# the loop body is omit`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly. They are part of the loop body and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
