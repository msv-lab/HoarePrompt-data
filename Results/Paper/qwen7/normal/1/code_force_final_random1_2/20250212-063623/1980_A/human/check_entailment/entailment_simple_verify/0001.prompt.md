You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes `t` and `test_cases` with predefined values, simulating multiple test cases.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.
   - It takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level using a list `freq`.
   - It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the available problems (`f`).
   - The sum of these missing problems is appended to the `results` list.
3. **Output**: The program iterates over the `results` list and prints each value, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It handles the input, processes each test case, and produces the correct output.
