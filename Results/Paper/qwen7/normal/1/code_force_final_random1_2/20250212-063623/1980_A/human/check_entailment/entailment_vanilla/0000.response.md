### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes `t` and `test_cases` with predefined values, simulating multiple test cases.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.
   - It takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level using a list `freq`.
   - It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the available problems (`f`).
   - The sum of these missing problems is appended to the `results` list.
3. **Output**: The program iterates over the `results` list and prints each value, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It handles the input, processes each test case, and produces the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
