Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, with one list at index `v-1` now containing the value `[u-1], u` and `v` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` and `v` are obtained from user input, their values remain unchanged, but `u` is now `u-1`. The state of `n` and `u2vs` remains the same as the initial state.
