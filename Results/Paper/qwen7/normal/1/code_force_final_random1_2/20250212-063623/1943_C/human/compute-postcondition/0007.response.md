Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, with one list at index `v-1` now containing the value `[u]`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list at index `v-1` in the list `u2vs`. Since `u2vs` initially contains `n` empty lists, after executing the code, the list at index `v-1` will contain the value `[u]`. All other lists remain empty, and the values of `n` and `u2vs` are updated accordingly.
