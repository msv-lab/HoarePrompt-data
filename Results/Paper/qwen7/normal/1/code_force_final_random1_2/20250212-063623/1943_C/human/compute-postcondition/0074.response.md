To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ops` is a list of tuples.
   - The length of `path_ba` determines the number of tuples in `ops`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains six tuples: (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), and (c, 6).
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains twelve tuples: (`c1`, `i + 4`), (`c2`, `i + 4`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i + 4`).

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The specific values of `c`, `c1`, `c2`, `i`, and `previous` are not provided, but they do not affect the length of `ops`.
   - The key factor is the length of `path_ba`.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `path_ba` has an odd length, `ops` will have 6 tuples.
   - If `path_ba` has an even length, `ops` will have 12 tuples.

Since the problem does not specify whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the question asks for the length of `ops`, which is directly dependent on the length of `path_ba`.

Given the conditions, if we assume the most general case without additional information, we can infer that the length of `ops` will be either 6 or 12 based on the parity of `path_ba`.

Since the problem does not specify which scenario applies, we should consider the most straightforward and common scenario, which is the one with more tuples (12 tuples), as it is more likely to be the default or primary case unless otherwise specified.

Therefore, the length of `ops` will be 12.

Output: **12**
