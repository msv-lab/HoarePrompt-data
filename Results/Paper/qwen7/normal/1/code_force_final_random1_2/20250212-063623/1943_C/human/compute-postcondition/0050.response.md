Output State: **`ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`, `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is at least 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
