Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, with one list at index `v-1` now containing the value `[v-1, u-1] and an additional element `u-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `u-1` to the list at index `v-1` in the `u2vs` list. Since `u2vs[v-1]` initially contains `[v-1, u-1]`, after appending `u-1`, it becomes `[v-1, u-1, u-1]`. All other elements in the `u2vs` list remain unchanged.
