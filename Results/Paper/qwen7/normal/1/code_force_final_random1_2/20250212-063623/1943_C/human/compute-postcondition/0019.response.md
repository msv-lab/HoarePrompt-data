Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, with one list at index `v` now containing the value `[v, u] and an additional element `u`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is `v-1`**.

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the `u2vs` list. Initially, the list at index `v` contains `[v, v-1]`. After executing the code, this list becomes `[v, v-1, u]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
