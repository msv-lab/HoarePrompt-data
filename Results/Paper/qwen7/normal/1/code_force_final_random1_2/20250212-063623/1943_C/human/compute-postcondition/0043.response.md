Output State: `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to the starting node `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `path_ba` list will contain the initial node `b` followed by a series of nodes leading from `b` back to the starting node `a`. This sequence of nodes is determined by repeatedly following the `previous` array until reaching a node `n` such that `n == -1`, which signifies the end of the path. The loop continues to append nodes to `path_ba` until it finds the starting node `a` or reaches a node with no predecessor (`-1`).
