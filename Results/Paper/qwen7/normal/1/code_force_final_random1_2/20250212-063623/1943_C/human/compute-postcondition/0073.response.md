Postcondition: **`ops` is a list of tuples. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains six tuples: (c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), and (c, 6). If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains twelve tuples: (`c1`, `i + 4`), (`c2`, `i + 4`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i + 2`), (`c2`, `i + 2`), (`c1`, `i`), (`c2`, `i`), (`c1`, `i`), and (`c2`, `i + 4`). The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their state after the third iteration.**
