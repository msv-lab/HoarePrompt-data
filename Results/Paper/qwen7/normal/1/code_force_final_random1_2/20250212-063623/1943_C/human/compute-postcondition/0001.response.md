Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, representing that initially, no vertices have any neighbors. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and its constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) is still valid.
