Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, with one list at index `u-1` now containing the value `v`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list located at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Given that `u` is defined as `u-1`, the list at index `u-1` (which is the same as index `u-1` since `u` is `u-1`) in `u2vs` is modified to include `v`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
