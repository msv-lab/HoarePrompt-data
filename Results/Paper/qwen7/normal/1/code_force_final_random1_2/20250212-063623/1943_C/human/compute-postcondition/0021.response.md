Output State: **`d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 0. It returns two values: `d`, which represents the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes, and an underscore `_` which is used to ignore the second return value of the `bfs` function. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the BFS operation.
