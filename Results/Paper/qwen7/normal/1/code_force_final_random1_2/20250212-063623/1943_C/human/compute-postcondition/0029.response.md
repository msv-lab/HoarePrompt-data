Postcondition: `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the element `b`, the current value of `n` is `-1`.
