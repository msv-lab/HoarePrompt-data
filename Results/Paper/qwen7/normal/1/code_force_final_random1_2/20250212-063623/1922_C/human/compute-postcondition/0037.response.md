Output State: **`i` is `n-1` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0; `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the formula `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `i - 1` would be `n-2` (assuming `i` starts from 0), and `i + 1` would be `n`, which is out of bounds unless `n` is adjusted accordingly. However, the initial conditions state that `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `d2[i]` is now determined by the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
