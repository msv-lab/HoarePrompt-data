You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    1 5
    
    3 4

    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        d1[2] = 1
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        m = int(input())
        for j in range(m):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), a strictly increasing list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, an integer \( m \), and \( m \) pairs of integers \( (x_i, y_i) \). For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference based on two dictionaries \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), which are constructed from the list \( a \). Specifically, for each query \( (x_i, y_i) \), it computes and outputs the difference according to the values in \( d1 \) and \( d2 \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly between any two cities is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code uses `defaultdict` to store distances to the closest city.
   - It calculates the cost to reach each city from the left (`d1`) and from the right (`d2`).
   - The logic for calculating these distances seems flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the minimum cost to reach each city.

3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The variable `d1` and `d2` are intended to store the cumulative costs to reach each city, but the logic inside the loops is incorrect.
   - The condition `if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:` is comparing the differences incorrectly. It should be checking if the next city is closer than the previous one.
   - The cost calculation `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` and `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d1[i + 1]` are also incorrect. The cost should simply be the distance to the closest city plus the cumulative cost up to that point.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to precompute the closest city for each city and then use this information to calculate the minimum cost for each query.
   - We can use a stack to find the closest city efficiently.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
