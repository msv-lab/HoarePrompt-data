Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `(l[i] - l[i - 1]) >= (l[i + 1] - l[i])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains `n-1` and is still greater than or equal to 0. The condition `(l[i] - l[i - 1]) >= (l[i + 1] - l[i])` also remains valid since it was true before the update and no operation affects the values of `l[i]`, `l[i - 1]`, or `l[i + 1]`.
