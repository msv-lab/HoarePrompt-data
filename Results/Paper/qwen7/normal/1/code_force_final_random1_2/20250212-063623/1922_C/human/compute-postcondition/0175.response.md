Postcondition: `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`. Here, `i` is `n - 3` and `n` is at least 3.
