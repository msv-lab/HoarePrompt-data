Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`; `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to be `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i + 2` becomes 3. So, `d1[3]` is updated to be `1 + d1[2]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
