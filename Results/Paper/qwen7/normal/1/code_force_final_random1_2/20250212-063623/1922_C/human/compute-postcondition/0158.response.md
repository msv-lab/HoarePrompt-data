Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is greater than 2; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is 5) is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Since the values of `l` and `d1` at indices `i + 1` and `i + 2` are not specified, we express the updated value of `d1[5]` in terms of the known and unknown values. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
