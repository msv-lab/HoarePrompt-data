Output State: **`i` is `current_i + 3`; `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`; `n` must be greater than 1.**

The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The variable `i` is set to `current_i + 3`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
