Postcondition: `d2[i]` is updated based on the comparison of differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`, where `i` is `n - 4` and `n` must be at least 3. If the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is updated to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
