Postcondition: `j` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split, and the values of `x` and `y` are integers obtained from splitting the input. Whether `y` is greater than `x` or not, the values of `j`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
