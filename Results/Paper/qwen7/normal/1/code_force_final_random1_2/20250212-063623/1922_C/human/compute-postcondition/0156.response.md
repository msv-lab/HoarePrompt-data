Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - The condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` was not met (since it was not mentioned, we assume it did not meet this condition as per the given postcondition).

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - Since `n` is greater than 2, `n` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to update the state of `i` to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 2.

5. **Postcondition Consideration:**
   - The postcondition for the loop body is not directly relevant here since we are only concerned with the loop head and the next iteration.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2**
