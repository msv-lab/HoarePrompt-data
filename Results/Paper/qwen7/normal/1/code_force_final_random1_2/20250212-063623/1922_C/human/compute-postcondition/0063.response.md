Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `m` is greater than 2 but no specific value is given.
- `x` and `y` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided.
- `x` and `y` are converted from inputs to integers.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is a dictionary, and `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` refer to the values associated with keys `y` and `x` respectively in the dictionary `d2`.

Since the values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. However, we can describe the expression being printed.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]** (where `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2` respectively)
