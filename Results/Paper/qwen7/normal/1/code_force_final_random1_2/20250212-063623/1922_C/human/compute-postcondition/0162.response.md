Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n-2`, `n` remains greater than 2, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d1[n]` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for each iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes, the value of `i` is `n-2`, `n` is still greater than 2, `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1, and `d1[n]` has been updated according to the conditions present in the loop for each iteration.
