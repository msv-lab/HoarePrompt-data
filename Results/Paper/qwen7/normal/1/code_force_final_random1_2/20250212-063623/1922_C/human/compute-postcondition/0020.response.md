Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` by setting the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
