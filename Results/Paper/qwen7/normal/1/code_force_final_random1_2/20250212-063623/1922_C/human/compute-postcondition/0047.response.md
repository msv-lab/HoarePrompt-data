Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means we need to set `j` to 0 and ensure that `m` is a positive integer (greater than 0) so that the loop can run at least once.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state of `j` and `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `j` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 0

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
