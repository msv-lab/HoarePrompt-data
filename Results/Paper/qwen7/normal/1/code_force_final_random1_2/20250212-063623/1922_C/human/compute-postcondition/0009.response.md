Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2] = 2`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`. The current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than the current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` was initially 1, `i + 2` becomes 3. Since `d1[2]` was initially 1, `d1[i + 1]` (which is `d1[3]`) is set to `1 + 1`, making `d1[3]` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
