Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The problem states that `i` is `n - 2` before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the range of `i`**: The loop runs from `n - 2` to `1` (since the range is inclusive of the start and exclusive of the stop), decrementing by 1 each time.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` must be within the range defined by the loop. Specifically, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that `i` is initially `n - 2`, we need to ensure that `n - 2 >= 1` and `n - 2 < n`. This simplifies to `n > 3`.

6. **Consider other variables**: The problem mentions that `d2[n - 1]` is 1 and `d1` is updated based on the loop body. However, these variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 3**
