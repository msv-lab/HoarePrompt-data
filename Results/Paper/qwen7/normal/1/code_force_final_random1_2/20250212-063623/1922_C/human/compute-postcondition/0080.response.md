Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers.

4. **Check the condition inside the loop**:
   - For `i = 3`, the condition is `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`.
   - For `i = 1`, the condition is `l[i + 1] - l[i] >= l[i] - l[i - 1]`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is still satisfied**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `n-1`, the new value of `i` should still be within this range.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers**
