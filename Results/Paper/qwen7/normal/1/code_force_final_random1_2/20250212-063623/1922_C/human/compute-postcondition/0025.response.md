Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[n]` is determined by the loop's condition, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` and retains its initial state, `d2[n-1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `i` is set to `n-1` as the loop runs from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive), and the loop has completed.
- `d1[2]` remains 1 as it is not modified after the initial assignment.
- `d1[n]` is updated based on the loop's logic, which compares differences in the list `l`.
- `d2` remains unchanged as it is not referenced within the loop body, and `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to 1.
