Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly between any two cities is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code uses `defaultdict` to store distances to the closest city.
   - It calculates the cost to reach each city from the left (`d1`) and from the right (`d2`).
   - The logic for calculating these distances seems flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the minimum cost to reach each city.

3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The variable `d1` and `d2` are intended to store the cumulative costs to reach each city, but the logic inside the loops is incorrect.
   - The condition `if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:` is comparing the differences incorrectly. It should be checking if the next city is closer than the previous one.
   - The cost calculation `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` and `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d1[i + 1]` are also incorrect. The cost should simply be the distance to the closest city plus the cumulative cost up to that point.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to precompute the closest city for each city and then use this information to calculate the minimum cost for each query.
   - We can use a stack to find the closest city efficiently.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
