Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The variables involved here are the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which we'll call `num_iterations`. This variable determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\). This means `t` is some integer value within this range.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `num_iterations` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0. Since `num_iterations` is the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, it is an integer input from the standard input.

Given that `t` was an integer within the specified range, let's assume `t` was the number of iterations for the previous loop. For the next iteration, `num_iterations` will be `t - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `num_iterations` is now `t - 1`.

Since `t` was an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), the new value of `num_iterations` will still be within the same range, but it will be one less than the previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), and `num_iterations` is \(t - 1\)**
