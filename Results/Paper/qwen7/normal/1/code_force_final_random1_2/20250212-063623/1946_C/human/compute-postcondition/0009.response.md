Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of an integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set includes two integers n and k, and then n - 1 lines representing edges in a tree. For each set of input data, the function calls `solve()` exactly t times. After processing all input sets, the function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by incrementing a counter `num_iterations` up to `t - 1`.**
