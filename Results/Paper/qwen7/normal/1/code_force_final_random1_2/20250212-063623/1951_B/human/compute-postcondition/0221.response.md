Output State: **`i` is an integer, `h` is an integer, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`; `z` is 1; `ans1` is 1.**

The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Since `ans1` was initially 1 (as given by the initial state where `z` is 1), after executing the code, `ans1` becomes 2. All other variables (`i`, `h`, and `z`) remain unchanged.
