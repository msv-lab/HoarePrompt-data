Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. For each test case, the function processes the list `a` and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

Note: The specific return value for each test case is not detailed in the provided output cases, so the functionality focuses on the structure and input of the function.
