Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function which takes `n` as an argument.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range` function).
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` should be set to the length of the list `a`.
   - Since `x` is the element at index `k` in list `a`, it doesn't need to be adjusted because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ind` is an empty list, and `c` is 0. These variables are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`**
