Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), followed by a list \( s \) of \( n \) distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of \( s \) with the \( k \)-th element. After the swap, it counts the number of elements in \( s \) that are less than or equal to the first element before the swap (\( ans \)) and the number of elements equal to the first element before the swap plus the count of elements less than the first element if the first element was not equal to the first element after the swap (\( ans1 \)). Finally, it prints the maximum of \( ans \) and \( ans1 \).**
