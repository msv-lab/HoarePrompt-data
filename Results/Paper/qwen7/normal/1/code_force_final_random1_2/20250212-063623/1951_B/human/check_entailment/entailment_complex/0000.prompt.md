# Problem:
[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0

    if (ind == []) :
        return n - 1

    #State: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, `ind` is a list containing the value 1, and `ind` is not an empty list
    if (len(ind) == 1) :
        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns a value that is 1 less than the value of variable `k`
        #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, `ind` is a list containing the value 1, and `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is 1, and the first element of `ind` is not 0

        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)

    #State: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, `ind` is a list containing the value 1, and `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the element at index 1 of list ind minus 1, and k minus 1, where k is not defined in the initial state and thus cannot be determined. However, since ind only contains one element (0) at index 0, ind does not have an element at index 1. Therefore, the expression ind[1] - 1 is invalid, and the program would raise an IndexError.
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, `ind` is a list containing the value 1, and `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1, and the first element of `ind` is not 0

        #The program returns the value of `val - 1`, where `val` is the second element of the list `ind` and is a non-zero value not equal to 1.
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, `ind` is a list containing the value 1, and `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1, and the first element of `ind` is not 0, and the first element of `ind` is less than or equal to `k`
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns k - 1, where k is at least 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list to find indices where elements are greater than a specific value `x`, which is the `k`-th element of the list. Based on certain conditions, it returns one of the following:
1. The length of the list `a` minus 1.
2. A value that is 1 less than the value of `k`.
3. 0.
4. The maximum value between `k - 0` and `0 - 1`.
5. An invalid operation due to an IndexError because the list `ind` only contains one element (0) and does not have an element at index 1.
6. The value of the second element of the list `ind` minus 1, where the second element is a non-zero value not equal to 1.
7. `k - 1`, where `k` is at least 1.
