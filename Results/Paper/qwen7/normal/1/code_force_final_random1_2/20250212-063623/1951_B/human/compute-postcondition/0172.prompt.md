Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in the list `s[1:]` that are not greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `s[0]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values, `ans1` is 0, `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element of the list `s`, `s` is a list, and `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `s[0]` equals `h`, then `z` remains 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `i` remains less than or equal to `h`, and `ans1` is set to 1 if `z` equals 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `s` is a list, and `z` is 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1. Otherwise, either `i` is greater than `h` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `ans1` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `s` is a list, and `z` is 1. If `i` equals `h`, the program continues without changing `z`. Otherwise, either `i` is greater than `h` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `z` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
