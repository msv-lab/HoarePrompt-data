Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the element at index `k` in list `a`; `ind` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ind`. No changes are made to the existing values of `a`, `k`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
