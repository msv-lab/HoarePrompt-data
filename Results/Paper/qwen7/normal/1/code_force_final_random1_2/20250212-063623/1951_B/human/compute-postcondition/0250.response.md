Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `s`, `h` is an integer, `s[0]` is an integer, `ans1` is either 2 if `i` equals `h`, or 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is greater than `h`, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, `ans1` remains as 1 or 2. If `i` equals `h`, `ans1` becomes 2 or 3. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, `ans1` becomes 3.
