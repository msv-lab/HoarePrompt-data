Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the third element in `s`, `z` is 1, and `ans1` is 2. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` remains 2. If `s[0]` equals `h`, then either `ans1` remains 2 (if `i` is not greater than `h`) or the most internal loop or if statement is exited (if `i` is greater than `h`).
