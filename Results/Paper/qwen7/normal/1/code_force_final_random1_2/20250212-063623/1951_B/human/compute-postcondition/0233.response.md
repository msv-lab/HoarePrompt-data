Output State: **`i` is the next element in `s`, `h` is an integer, `s[0]` is an integer, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
