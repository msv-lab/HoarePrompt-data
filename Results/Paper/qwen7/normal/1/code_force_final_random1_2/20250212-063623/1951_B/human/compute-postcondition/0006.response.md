Output State: **`ind` contains the value `i`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.**

The code `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `ind`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
