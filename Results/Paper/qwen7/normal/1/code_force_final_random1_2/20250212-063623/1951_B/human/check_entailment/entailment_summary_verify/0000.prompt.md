You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if k == 14:
        print(ind)
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list to find indices where elements are greater than a specific value `x`, which is the `k`-th element of the list. Based on certain conditions, it returns one of the following:
1. The length of the list `a` minus 1.
2. A value that is 1 less than the value of `k`.
3. 0.
4. The maximum value between `k - 0` and `0 - 1`.
5. An invalid operation due to an IndexError because the list `ind` only contains one element (0) and does not have an element at index 1.
6. The value of the second element of the list `ind` minus 1, where the second element is a non-zero value not equal to 1.
7. `k - 1`, where `k` is at least 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Logic**: The function `func_1` tries to find the positions of the two cows with ratings greater than the rating of cow `k`. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers the first two cows with higher ratings, which may not be optimal.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   6 1
   12 10 14 11 8 3
   ```

   - The cow at position 1 (rating 12) is cow `k`.
   - The cow at position 2 (rating 10) will play against cow `k` in the first match and win.
   - Cow `k` will then play against the cow at position 3 (rating 14) and lose.
   
   Therefore, cow `k` can only win 1 match. However, the function incorrectly returns a value that does not reflect this scenario.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves considering all cows with higher ratings and determining the best position to swap cow `k` to maximize the number of wins. The current implementation does not account for all such scenarios.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
