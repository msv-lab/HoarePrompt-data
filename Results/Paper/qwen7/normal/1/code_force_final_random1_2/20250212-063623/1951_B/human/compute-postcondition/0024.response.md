Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `c` is 1**

The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given that `c` was initially unspecified in the context provided, we assume it was 0 before this line of code was executed. After executing `c += 1`, `c` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
