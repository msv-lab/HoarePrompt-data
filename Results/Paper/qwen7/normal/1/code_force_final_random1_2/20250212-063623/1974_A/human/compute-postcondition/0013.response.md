Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\), `x` is the first integer entered from input, `y` is the second integer entered from input, `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2\).**

The code updates the value of `z` to \((y + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
