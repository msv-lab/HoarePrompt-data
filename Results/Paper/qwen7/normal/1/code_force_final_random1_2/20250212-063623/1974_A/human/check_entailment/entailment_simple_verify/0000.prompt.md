You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), and `m` is \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\). If `m` is less than `a` during any iteration, `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\). The final value of `z` will be the maximum value of `z` calculated during any iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the number of 2x2 icons is greater than half the total number of cells available on a single screen (which is 15). For example, consider the case where there are 8 2x2 icons and 0 1x1 icons. According to the problem description, the minimum number of screens needed should be 2, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 1.

To illustrate, let's consider the following input:
```
1
8 0
```

The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because 8 icons of size 2x2 would require 2 screens since each screen can only hold 4 such icons.

A corrected version of the program should properly account for the number of 2x2 icons and ensure that the remaining space is filled optimally with 1x1 icons.
