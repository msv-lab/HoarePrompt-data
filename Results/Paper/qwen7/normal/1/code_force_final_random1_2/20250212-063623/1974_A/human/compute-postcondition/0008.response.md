Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15, `m` is 15 * z - y * 4, and either `m` is less than `a` or there is no else part, meaning `m` remains as 15 * z - y * 4.
