Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `x` is the first integer entered.
   - `y` is the second integer entered.
   - `z` is initially calculated as \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).
   - `m` is calculated as \(15 * z - y * 4\).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).

3. **Final Value of `z`**:
   - Since the initial calculation of `z` depends on `m`, and `m` is updated if it is less than `a`, we need to consider both scenarios:
     - **Scenario 1**: If `m` is not less than `a`, the initial value of `z` remains unchanged.
     - **Scenario 2**: If `m` is less than `a`, `z` is updated to the new value.

Given that the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `z`. However, we can describe the value of `z` based on the formula provided.

Output: **z (where z is calculated as \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\) with m being either \(15 * z - y * 4\) or remaining unchanged if \(15 * z - y * 4 \geq a\))**
