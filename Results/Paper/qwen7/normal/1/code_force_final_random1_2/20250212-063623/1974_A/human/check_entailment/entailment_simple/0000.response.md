Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading `x` and `y` for each case.
3. The variable `z` is initialized as `(y + 1) // 2`, which calculates the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens without considering the remaining space.
4. The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which represents the total number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
5. The condition `if m < a:` checks if there are not enough 1x1 icons to fill the remaining space on the current screen. If this condition is true, `z` is updated to account for the additional screens needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.
6. The formula used to update `z` is `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`, which ensures that the number of additional screens needed is correctly calculated.

Given the logic and the calculations, the program appears to correctly compute the minimum number of screens required to fit both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The formulae used in the program align with the constraints and requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
