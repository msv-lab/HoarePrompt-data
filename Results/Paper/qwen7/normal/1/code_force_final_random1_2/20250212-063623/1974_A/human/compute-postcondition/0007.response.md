Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15, `m` is 15 * z - y * 4, and the current value of `m` is less than `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `(x - m + 14) // 15` to its previous value. The previous value of `z` was `(y + 1) // 2`, so the new value of `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`. The other variables remain unchanged.
