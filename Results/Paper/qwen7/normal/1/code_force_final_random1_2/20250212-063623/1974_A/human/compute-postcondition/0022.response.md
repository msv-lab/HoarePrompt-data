Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to be \(15 * z - y * 4\), where `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` is now calculated based on the updated value of `z`.
