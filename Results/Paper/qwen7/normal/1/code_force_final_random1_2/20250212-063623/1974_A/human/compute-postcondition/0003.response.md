Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to `(y + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`, which means `z` is the integer division of `y + 1` by 2. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
