Reasoning:
- The provided code contains several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` seem relevant to the problem statement.
- `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the implementation of `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem. It simply returns a fixed value of 4, which is incorrect.
- `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, writing the result to `sys.stdout`. Since `func_15` returns 4 for all test cases, the output will always be a series of 4s, which is incorrect.

Given that the core function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
