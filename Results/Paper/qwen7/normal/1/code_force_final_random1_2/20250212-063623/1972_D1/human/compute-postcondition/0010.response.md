Output State: **`ans` is increased by `(n + i) // (i * i)`, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` must be adjusted such that `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= n + (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the value of `(n + i) // (i * i)`. It also increases `i` by 1. Additionally, it ensures that `n` is adjusted according to the condition `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= n + (i + 1)`. The initial conditions for `ans`, `i`, and `n` remain valid, but their values are updated as specified.
