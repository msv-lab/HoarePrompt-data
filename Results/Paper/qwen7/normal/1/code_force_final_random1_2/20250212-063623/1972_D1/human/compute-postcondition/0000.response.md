Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the function call `func_10()`. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the loop's execution. The key variable here is the result of `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, this information about `t` does not directly influence the loop's execution based on the given code snippet.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set the return value of `func_10()` to a positive integer. Since the exact value returned by `func_10()` is not specified, we can assume it returns a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
