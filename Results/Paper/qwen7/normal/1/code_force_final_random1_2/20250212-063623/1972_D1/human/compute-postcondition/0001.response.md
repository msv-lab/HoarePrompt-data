Output State: **`func_15()` returns a positive integer and is printed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` calls the function `func_15()`. Since `func_15()` must return a positive integer according to the initial state, it will return a positive integer. This integer is then converted to a string and printed using `sys.stdout.write`. The initial state that `func_10()` must return a positive integer is not directly affected by this code, but it is mentioned as part of the precondition. Therefore, the output state is that `func_15()` returns a positive integer and is printed.
