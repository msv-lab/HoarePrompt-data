### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code defines several utility functions, but none of them directly solve the problem. Let's review the functions:

1. **func_1**: Reads an integer from standard input.
2. **func_2**: Reads two integers from standard input.
3. **func_3**: Reads two integers from standard input and returns them as a list.
4. **func_4**: Reads a list of pairs of integers from standard input.
5. **func_5**: Reads a line from standard input and strips the trailing newline character.
6. **func_6**: Reads a line from standard input, strips the trailing newline character, and decodes it to UTF-8.
7. **func_7**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list.
8. **func_8**: Reads a list of pairs of integers for a specified number of test cases.
9. **func_9**: Reads a line from standard input.
10. **func_10**: Reads an integer from standard input.
11. **func_11**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into strings, and returns them as a list.
12. **func_12**: Processes a graph traversal (not relevant to the problem).
13. **func_13**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (not relevant to the problem).
14. **func_14**: Checks if a list of integers can be reduced to a certain value (not relevant to the problem).
15. **func_15**: Returns a constant value 4 (not relevant to the problem).
16. **func_16**: Writes the constant value 4 for each test case (not relevant to the problem).

None of these functions implement the required logic to solve the problem. Specifically, none of them handle the calculation of the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_15` and `func_16` simply return and print a constant value, which is clearly incorrect for the problem at hand.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.
