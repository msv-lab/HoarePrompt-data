Reasoning:
The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: Many of the functions defined do not match the requirements of the problem. For example, `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc., do not seem to be relevant to the problem statement. They either read input incorrectly or perform operations unrelated to the problem.

2. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic required to solve the problem is missing. Specifically, the program should calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Output**: The function `func_16` is supposed to handle multiple test cases, but it simply calls `func_15` repeatedly and prints the result of `func_15` without any modifications. This does not address the problem requirements.

4. **Unnecessary Functions**: Some functions like `func_12`, `func_13`, `func_14`, and `func_15` are not used in the context of the problem and do not contribute to solving the problem.

Given these issues, the program as annotated does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
