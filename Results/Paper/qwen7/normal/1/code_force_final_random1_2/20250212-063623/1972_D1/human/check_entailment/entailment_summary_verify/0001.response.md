### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided function `func_15()` does not align with the problem requirements. Let's re-examine the problem and the provided code to ensure a thorough evaluation.

#### Problem Revisited
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Revisited
- **`func_10()`**: Reads an integer from stdin.
- **`func_15()`**: This function reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`. It then iterates over possible values of \(i\) and calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\), adding these values to `ans`. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Analysis of `func_15()`
- The logic in `func_15()` does not involve checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Instead, it appears to be counting some divisor-related quantity, which is not relevant to the problem.

Given this, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` does not solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem.
