Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only variable involved here is `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The value written is a positive integer greater than 1, which is the same as the value returned by `func_10()` initially.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0.
   - Since the value written by `sys.stdout.write` is the same as the value returned by `func_10()` initially, and it is a positive integer greater than 1, the loop will decrement this value by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `func_10()` should return a value that is one less than what it returned in the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `func_10()` returns a value that is one less than the value it returned in the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character, where the value written is a positive integer greater than 2 (one less than the value returned by `func_10()` initially)**.
