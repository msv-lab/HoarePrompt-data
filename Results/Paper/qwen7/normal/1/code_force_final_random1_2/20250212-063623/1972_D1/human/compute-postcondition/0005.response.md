Output State: **`sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character, where the value written is a positive integer greater than 2 (one less than the value returned by `func_10()` initially), and `func_15()` is called.**

In this output state, the code has called `func_15()` and written its return value (a positive integer greater than 2) followed by a newline character using `sys.stdout.write`. The precondition that `func_15()` returns a value one less than what `func_10()` returns initially is still valid.
