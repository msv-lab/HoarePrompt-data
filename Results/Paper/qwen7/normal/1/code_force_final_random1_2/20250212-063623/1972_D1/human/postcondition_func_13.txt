The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, adjusting `k` based on the difference between each element and `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the iteration, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
