Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
   - `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the first part to an integer.
   - `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the last part to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple: `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The expression `c < b % 3` will evaluate to either `True` or `False`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, then the `print` function will output the first element of the tuple, i.e., `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, then the `print` function will output the second element of the tuple, i.e., `-1`.

4. **Determining the Value:**
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the expression `c < b % 3`.
   - Without specific values, we cannot determine if `c < b % 3` is `True` or `False`, but we know that the `print` function will output either `a - -b // 3` or `-1`.

Given the lack of specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can only describe the potential outputs based on the logical evaluation of the condition.

**Output:**
Output: **a - -b // 3 or -1 (depending on the value of c and b % 3)**
