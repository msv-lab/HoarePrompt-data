Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, `c` is the integer value of the last part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, and `s` is the next line of input from the input stream.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` by spaces and converts each part to an integer, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus the original value of `c`. The values of `a` and `c` are derived from the split and converted parts of `s`. The value of `s` remains the next line of input from the input stream.
