Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into parts based on spaces and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
