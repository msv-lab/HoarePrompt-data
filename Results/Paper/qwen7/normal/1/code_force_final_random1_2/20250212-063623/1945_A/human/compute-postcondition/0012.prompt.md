Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the first part to an integer, `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the last part to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the first part to an integer, `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the last part to an integer, and `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, `c` is the integer value of the last part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, and `s` is the next line of input from the input stream; `b` is increased by `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
