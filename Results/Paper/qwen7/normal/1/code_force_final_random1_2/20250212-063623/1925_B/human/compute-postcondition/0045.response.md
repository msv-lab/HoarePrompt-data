Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. Additionally, `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 1, `ans` will be updated to 1 if `ans` was less than 1, or remain unchanged if `ans` was already 1 or greater. All other variables and conditions remain the same as the initial state.
