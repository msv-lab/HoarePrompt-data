Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, there exists an integer `i` such that \(1 \leq i \leq x\) and `x % i == 0`. If the condition `(x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0)` is true, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `ans` remain unchanged.
