Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. If \(x - n \times i \geq 0\) and \((x - n \times i) \% i == 0\), then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is still incremented by 1.
