Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of 3 and `x // i`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true, if `x % i == 0` and `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` hold. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of 3 and `2`, `x` remains unchanged, and the conditions remain as in the precondition.
