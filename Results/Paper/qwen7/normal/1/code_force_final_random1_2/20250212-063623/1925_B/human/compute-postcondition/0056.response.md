Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true, and if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` holds, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
