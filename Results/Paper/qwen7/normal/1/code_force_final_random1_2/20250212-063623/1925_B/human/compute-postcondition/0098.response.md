Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates `ans` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `x`, `sqrt(x)`, and the previous value of `i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
