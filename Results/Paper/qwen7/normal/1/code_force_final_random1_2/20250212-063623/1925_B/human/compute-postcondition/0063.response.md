Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `sqrt(x)`.
2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 2, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `sqrt(x)` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true.**
