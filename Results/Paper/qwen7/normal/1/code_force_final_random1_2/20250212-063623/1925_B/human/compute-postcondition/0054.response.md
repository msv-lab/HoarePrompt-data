Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `q` is 1
   - `x` is the first integer input
   - `n` is the second integer input
   - `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, where `i` was 1 in the previous iteration
   - `i` is 1
   - `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer
   - The condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` was checked, and if it was true, `ans` was updated.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Current State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - We need to check if the loop should continue based on the condition `1 <= i <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains 1 as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` remains the same unless the condition inside the loop is met again.
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `sqrt(x)` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Condition Check for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, we need to check if `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` changes to 2.
- The condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true.**
