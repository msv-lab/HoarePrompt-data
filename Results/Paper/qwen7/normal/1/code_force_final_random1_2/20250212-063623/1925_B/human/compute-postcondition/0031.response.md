Output State: **`x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial postcondition.
