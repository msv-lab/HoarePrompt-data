Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The values of `x`, `sqrt(x)`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `i` is updated to be the previous value of `i` plus 1. The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`.
