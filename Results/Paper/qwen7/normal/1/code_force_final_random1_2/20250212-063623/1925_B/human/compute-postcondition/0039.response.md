Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `x` and `n`. The initial values of `t`, `q`, and `x` are updated, while `n` is set to the second integer input. The variable `ans` is not assigned a value yet, so it remains undefined.
