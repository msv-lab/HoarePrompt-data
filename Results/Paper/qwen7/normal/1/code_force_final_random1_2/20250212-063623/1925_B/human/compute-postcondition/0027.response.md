Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.
2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
3. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition involves updating `ans` based on the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`. If the condition is met, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value and `i` retains its original value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` are integers.
- The condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` was either met or not met.
- If the condition was met, `ans` was updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` retained its original value and `i` retained its original value.

For the next iteration of the loop:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` being within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `x`, `n`, and `ans` will retain their original values.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`**
