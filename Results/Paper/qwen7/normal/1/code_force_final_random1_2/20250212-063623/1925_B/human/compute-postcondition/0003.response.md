Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `x`, and `n`. However, `i` is initialized within the loop itself (it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration). Therefore, the only variables we need to consider for adjustment are `x` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, the loop will execute if `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` is at least 1. This means `sqrt(x)` must be a non-negative number, and `x` must be a non-negative number.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `n` must be an integer that the loop can use in its calculations.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `x` is a non-negative integer and that `n` is an integer. The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution, but it should still be considered part of the initial state since it is given.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is 1**
