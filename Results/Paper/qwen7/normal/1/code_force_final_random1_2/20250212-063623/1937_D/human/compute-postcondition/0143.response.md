Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is not decreased by 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - r - 3] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, the same conditions hold as the precondition.
