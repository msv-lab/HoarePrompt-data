Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, and `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes an empty list `B`.
- The variables `i`, `A`, and `idx_A` remain as per the initial state since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
- The list `B` remains unchanged and stays as an empty list.
