Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (3 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `x` based on the last element of list `A`, the value of `i`, and the last element of list `idx_A`. However, since the initial values of `A` and `idx_A` are not provided, the expression for `x` remains as given. The conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
