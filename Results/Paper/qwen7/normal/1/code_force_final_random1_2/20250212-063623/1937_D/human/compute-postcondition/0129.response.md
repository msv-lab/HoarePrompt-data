Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
   - The character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>'.
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - `l` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`.
   - The current value of `a` is updated to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b` is the character at index `r - l` in string `B`.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is non-negative.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `i`:

- `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`. Since `r` is derived from some previous state but is not explicitly defined, we need to focus on the operations involving `a`.
- `b` is the character at index `r - l` in string `B`. Again, `B` is not explicitly defined, but we know that `b` is updated based on the condition `r - l` being non-negative.
- `i` is a value that is less than `n` and is used in the update formula for `a`.

Since the exact strings `r` and `B` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` in terms of the variables involved.

Output: **2*a + 2*b + i + 1**
