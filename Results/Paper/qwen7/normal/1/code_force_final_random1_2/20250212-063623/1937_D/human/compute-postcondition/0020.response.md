Output State: **`i` is 1 + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 1, `idx_A` is [1] if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, `A` is [A[0], x]**.

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Initially, `A` is either `[1]` if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged. After appending `x`, `A` becomes `[A[0], x]`, which is `[1, x]` if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', otherwise it becomes `[unchanged value, x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
