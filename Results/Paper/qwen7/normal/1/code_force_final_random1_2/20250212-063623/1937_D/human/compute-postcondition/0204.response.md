Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `x` is -2**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `r - (l + 2)`. Given that `r` is 2 and `l` is 2, the calculation becomes `2 - (2 + 2)`, which results in `-2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
