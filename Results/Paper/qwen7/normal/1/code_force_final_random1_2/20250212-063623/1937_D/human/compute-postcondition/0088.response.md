Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
