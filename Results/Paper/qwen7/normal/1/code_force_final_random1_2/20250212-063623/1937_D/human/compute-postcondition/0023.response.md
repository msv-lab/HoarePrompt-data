Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `idx_A` is [1, 2], `A` is [1, 0] if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', otherwise `A` is [A[0], A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 1], and `x` is A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `idx_A`. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial conditions. Therefore, `idx_A` now contains `[1, 2]`. The values of `n`, `A`, and `x` remain as per their initial conditions unless specified otherwise by the appended value of `i`.
