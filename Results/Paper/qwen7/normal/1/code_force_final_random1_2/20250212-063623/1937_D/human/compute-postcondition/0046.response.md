Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and the current value of `s[i]` is not less than or equal to '<', `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` based on the last element of `B` and the difference between the last index in `idx_B` and the current value of `i`. Since `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is not less than or equal to '<', these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `x` is computed using the provided formula.
