Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is greater than 0: This indicates `n` is a positive integer.
- `r` is decreased by 1: This means `r` is now one less than its original value.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`: Here, `a` is the element at index `r` in the list `B`.
- `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`: This updates `b` by adding the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `(r + 1)` to the current value of `b`.
- `b` remains unchanged if `l - r - 1 <= 0`: If the condition `l - r - 1` is less than or equal to 0, then `b` does not change.

The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. Let's break it down:

- `a * 2`: Since `a` is the value of `B[r]`, this part multiplies that value by 2.
- `b * 2`: This part multiplies the updated value of `b` by 2.
- `(n - i)`: Since `i` was incremented by 1, `n - i` will be `n - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - i - 1`.

Given these steps, the final expression to be printed is `2 * B[r] + 2 * b + (n - i - 1)`.

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * b + (n - i - 1)**
