Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `x` is -2, `b` is `r - 1` which is 1.**

Explanation: The code `b = B[r - 1]` assigns the value of `B[1]` (since `r - 1` equals 1) to the variable `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
