Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than 0; `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the character at index `l-1` in string `r` to variable `a`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
