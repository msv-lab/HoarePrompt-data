Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`; `b` is equal to `A[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s[i]`, `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
