Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0

4. **Next Iteration Check**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2**
