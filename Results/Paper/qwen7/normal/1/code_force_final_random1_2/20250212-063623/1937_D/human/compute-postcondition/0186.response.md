Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is decreased by 1: This means `r` has been decremented by 1.
   - `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`: Here, `A` is a list, `l` is an index, and `idx_A` is another list with an index `l - 1`. The value of `a` is computed from these components.
   - `b` is the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`: Similarly, `B` is a list, `r` and `l` are indices, and `idx_B` is another list with indices `r - l` and `r`. The value of `b` is computed from these components.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `a` and `b`:

- For `a`:
  - `A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `A`.
  - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` is the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l - 1` in `idx_A` and `l`.

- For `b`:
  - `B[r - l]` is the element at index `r - l` in the list `B`.
  - `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` is the product of the difference between the value at index `r - l` in `idx_B` and `i`, and the difference between `r` and `l`.
  - `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` is the product of the difference between the value at index `r` in `idx_B` and `i`, and `l`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and the specific indices `l` and `r` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can describe them based on the given formulas.

Finally, the print statement will output:
\[ a \times 2 + b \times 2 + i + 1 \]

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2*a + 2*b + i + 1 (where a and b are computed as described above)**
