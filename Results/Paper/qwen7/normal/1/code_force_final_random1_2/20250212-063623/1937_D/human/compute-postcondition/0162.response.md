Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`. This implies that `i` is being assigned a value that is one more than its previous value. However, the specific previous value of `i` is not explicitly given.
- `n` is greater than 0. This means `n` is a positive integer.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` is one more than its original value.

Since we don't have the exact initial value of `i`, we can only express the difference between `n` and `i` in terms of their relationship. We know that `i` is now one more than its original value, but without knowing the exact initial value, we cannot determine the precise numerical result of `n - i`.

Therefore, the output will be the expression `n - i` itself, as the exact value cannot be determined from the given information.

Output: **n - i**
