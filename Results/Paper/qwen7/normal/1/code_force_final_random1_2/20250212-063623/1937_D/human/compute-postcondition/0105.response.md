Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r`, `b` is equal to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, the conditions remain as initially stated.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `idx_A`, and `A`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `b` being equal to a specific expression only changes if `l - r > 0`, but since that condition is not specified to change, it remains as initially stated.
