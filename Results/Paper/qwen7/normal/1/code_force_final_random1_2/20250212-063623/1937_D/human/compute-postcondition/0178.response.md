Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `a` has been assigned the value of the element at index `l - 1` from the list `A`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
