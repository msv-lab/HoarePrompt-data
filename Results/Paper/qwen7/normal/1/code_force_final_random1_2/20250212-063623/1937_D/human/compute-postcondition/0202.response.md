Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
- The postconditions at the end of the previous iteration are:
  - `i` is incremented by 1.
  - `n` is greater than 0.
  - Depending on the value of `s[i]`:
    - If `s[i]` equals '>', then:
      - `l` is incremented by 1.
      - Depending on the value of `l` relative to `r`:
        - If `l < r`, then:
          - `a` is set to the value of `A[l]`.
          - `x` is set to `r - (l + 2)`.
          - `b` is set to the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`. If `r` is 0, no additional variables are changed. If `r` is not 0, then:
            - `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
            - `b` is set to `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
        - If `l >= r`, then no additional changes are made.
    - If `s[i]` does not equal '>', then:
      - `r` is decremented by 1.
      - If `l` is 0, the postcondition remains as `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `r` is decremented by 1.
      - Otherwise:
        - `a` is set to the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
        - `b` is set to the value of `B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
        - If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Increment `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

2. **Check `n` condition:**
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

3. **Check `s[i]`:**
   - Determine the value of `s[i]` to decide how to update other variables.

4. **Update `l` and `r`:**
   - If `s[i]` equals '>', increment `l` by 1.
   - If `s[i]` does not equal '>', decrement `r` by 1.

5. **Update `a` and `b`:**
   - Based on the conditions described, update `a` and `b` accordingly.

### Example Iteration:
Assume the following values at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is 5
- `s[2]` is '>'
- `l` is 1
- `r` is 3
- Other relevant variables are initialized as needed.

### Next Iteration:
- Increment `i` by 1: `i` becomes 3.
- Check `n`: `n` must still be greater than 0 (which it is).
- Since `s[3]` is not provided, we assume it could be anything, but typically it would follow the pattern.
- Increment `l` by 1: `l` becomes 2.
- Decrement `r` by 1: `r` becomes 2.

### Updated Variables:
- `i` is now 3.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `l` is now 2.
- `r` is now 2.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2**.

This state reflects the necessary adjustments based on the loop head variables and the given conditions.
