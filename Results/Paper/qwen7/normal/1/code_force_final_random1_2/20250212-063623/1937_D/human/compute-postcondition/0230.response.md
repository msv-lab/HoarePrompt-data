Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `a` is 8, `b` is -1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from `b`. Given that `r` is 1 and `l` is 2, `r - l` equals `-1`. Assuming `B` is an array (which is not explicitly defined but needed for the operation), and since no specific `B` is given, we consider `B[-1]` to be undefined or not applicable in this context. However, if we interpret it as a simple subtraction without needing the array, and considering typical integer operations, `b` is updated to `-1` (assuming `b` was initially `1`). All other variables remain unchanged.
