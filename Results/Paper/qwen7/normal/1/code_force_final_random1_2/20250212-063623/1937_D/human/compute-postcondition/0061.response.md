Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n-7`
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `A` is a list of integers (not involved in the loop head)
   - `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear (not involved in the loop head)
   - `B` is a list of integers (not involved in the loop head)
   - `idx_B` is updated to include the current value of `i` if `s[i] == '<'` (not directly involved in the loop head)

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` will be incremented to 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0**
