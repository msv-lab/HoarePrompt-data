Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is not decreased by 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the conditions for `i`, `n`, the character at index `i` in string `s`, `r`, and the fact that `r` is not decreased by 1 or equal to 0 remain unchanged. The new variable `a` now holds the value of `B[r]`.
