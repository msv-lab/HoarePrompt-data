Postcondition: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and if `l` is 0, then no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`, and its value is updated to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, while `b` is the character at index `r - l` in string `B`, and its value is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is non-negative.**
