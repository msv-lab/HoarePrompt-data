Output State: **i is 3, n is greater than 0, l is 3, r is 0, a is 1, b is -1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n-1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n-1`. The variable `l` will be 3 since it is incremented each time `s[i]` is '>', and the loop continues as long as `l < r`. Given that `r` is decremented each time `s[i]` is not '>', and considering the provided outputs after the first three iterations, `r` will eventually reach 0. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the conditions within the loop, and given the final state of `l` and `r`, `a` will be 1 and `b` will be -1.
