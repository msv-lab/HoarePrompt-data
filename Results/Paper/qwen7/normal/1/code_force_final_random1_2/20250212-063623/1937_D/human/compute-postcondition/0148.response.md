Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>'. If `l` is 0, `r` is not decreased by 1, and no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, if `l` is not 0, `a` is updated to the character at index `l-1` in string `r` with its value changed to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to the character at index `r - l` in string `B` with its value changed to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is non-negative. If `r` is 0, no changes are made to `r`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, if `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
