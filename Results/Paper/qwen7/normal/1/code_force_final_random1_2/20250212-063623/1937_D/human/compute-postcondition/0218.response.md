Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `a` is `B[1] + (idx_B[1] - 3) * 2`, and `b` is `A[1] - A[-2] + (3 - idx_A[1]) * 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `l` is 2, and `r` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(3 - idx_A[1]) * 2`. Since `idx_A[1]` is not specified, we keep it as part of the expression. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
