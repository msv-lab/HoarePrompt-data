Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is equal to `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other variables are affected, so their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
