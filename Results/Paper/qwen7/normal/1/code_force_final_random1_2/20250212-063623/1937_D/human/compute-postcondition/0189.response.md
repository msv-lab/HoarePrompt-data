Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is decreased by 1: This means `r` is now one less than its previous value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the components of the expression:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `idx_A[l - 1]` is a specific index in the list `idx_A`. Since the exact value of `idx_A` and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]`.

However, we can still describe the expression in a general form:
- `n - i`: This part subtracts the new value of `i` from `n`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This part calculates the difference between the new value of `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]`, then multiplies the result by 2.

Combining these parts, the expression becomes:
\[ n - (i + 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]

Simplifying this:
\[ n - i - 1 + 2i - 2 \times idx_A[l - 1] \]
\[ n + i - 1 - 2 \times idx_A[l - 1] \]

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of the simplified expression:
Output: **n + i - 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]**
