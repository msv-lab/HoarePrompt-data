Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` must be less than `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>'
- `r` equals 0

We need to evaluate the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

However, the value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not explicitly provided. Since it is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will describe the expression in terms of the variables involved.

Given that `r` equals 0, it does not affect the expression directly, so we can ignore it.

The expression simplifies to:
\[ n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]

Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified, we cannot simplify this further without additional information.

Output: **n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2**
