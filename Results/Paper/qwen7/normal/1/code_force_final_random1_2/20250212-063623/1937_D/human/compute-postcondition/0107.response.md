Postcondition: `i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and if `r` is 0, then `r` remains 0. If `r` is not 0, then `b` is equal to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise the conditions remain as initially stated.
