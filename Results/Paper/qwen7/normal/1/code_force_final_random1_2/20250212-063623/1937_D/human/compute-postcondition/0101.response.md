Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` plus 1, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. Since `l` is greater than `r` plus 1, `l - r - 1` is a valid index for the list `A`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
