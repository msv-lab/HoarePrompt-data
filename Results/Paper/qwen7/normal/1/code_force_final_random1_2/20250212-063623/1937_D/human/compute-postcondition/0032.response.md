Output State: **`i` is 3, `idx_A` is [3], `A` is a list containing 0 if `idx_A` was empty, otherwise `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (3 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and `A` becomes a list containing `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `idx_A`. Since the initial state does not specify whether `idx_A` was empty or not, we consider both cases. If `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing 0. If `idx_A` was not empty, then `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (3 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` becomes a list containing `x`. The value of `i` is updated to 3, and `idx_A` now contains the element 3.
