Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than 0; `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`, the current value of `a` is updated to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r - l` in string `B`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is non-negative.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
