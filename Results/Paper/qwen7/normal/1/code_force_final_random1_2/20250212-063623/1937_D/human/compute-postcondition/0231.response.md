Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `a` is 8, `b` is -10**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from the current value of `b`. Given that `r - l` is `1 - 2 = -1`, and `idx_B[r - l]` is implied to be `i` (since no `idx_B` array is defined, we assume it refers to `i`), the expression simplifies to `- (i - i) * -1 = -0 * -1 = 0`. However, since `i - i` results in `0`, the entire expression evaluates to `0`. Thus, `b` is updated to `-1 - 0 = -10`. All other variables remain unchanged.
