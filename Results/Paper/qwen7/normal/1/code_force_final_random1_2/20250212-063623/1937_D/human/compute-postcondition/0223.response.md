Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2. If `l` is less than `r`, then `b` is calculated as -15. Otherwise, if `r` is 0, the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `r` is not 0, then `a` is set to `B[1] + (idx_B[1] - 3) * 2`, and `b` is set to `A[1] - A[-2] + (3 - idx_A[1]) * 2`.
