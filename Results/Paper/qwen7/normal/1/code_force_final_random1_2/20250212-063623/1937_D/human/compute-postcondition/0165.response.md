Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - r - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `b = b - A[l - r - 1]` subtracts the value of `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged as per the initial state.
