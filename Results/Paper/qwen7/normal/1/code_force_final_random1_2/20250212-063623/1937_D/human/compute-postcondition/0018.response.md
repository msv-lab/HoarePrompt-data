Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `A` is [1, 0], and if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is [1].**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. Initially, `A` is either `[1]` (if the character at index 1 of `s` is '>') or an empty list (if the character at index 1 of `s` is not '>'). After appending `0`, `A` becomes `[1, 0]` if it was initially `[1]`, or `[0]` becomes `[0, 0]` if it was initially empty. However, since the exact initial state of `A` is dependent on the condition involving `s`, the output state reflects both possibilities, but with the appended value `0`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `idx_A` also remains the same.
