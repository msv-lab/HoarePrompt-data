Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print(i + 1, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i + 1`.

Since `i` is `i + 1`, it implies that `i` was previously some integer value, and now it is that value plus 1. Therefore, `i + 1` is simply the current value of `i`.

Output: **i + 1**
