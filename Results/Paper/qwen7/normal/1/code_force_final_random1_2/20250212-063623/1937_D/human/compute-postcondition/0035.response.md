Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined by the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, and `idx_A` based on the operations performed within the loop.

- `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, as the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- `A` will contain the sum of the lengths of all contiguous segments of '>' characters in `s`. For each segment of '>' characters starting at index `i_start` and ending at index `i_end`, the value added to `A` is `(i_end - i_start + 1) * (number of indices in idx_A up to i_end)`.
- `idx_A` will contain the indices of all positions in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear.

To summarize, `A` will accumulate the product of the length of each contiguous segment of '>' characters and the count of all previous segments of '>' characters encountered so far, while `idx_A` will store the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. The exact values in `A` and `idx_A` depend on the specific sequence of '>' and '<' characters in `s`.
