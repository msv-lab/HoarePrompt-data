Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is confirmed to be greater than 0, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is now calculated based on the new expression involving `idx_B[r - 1]`, `i`, and `l`.
