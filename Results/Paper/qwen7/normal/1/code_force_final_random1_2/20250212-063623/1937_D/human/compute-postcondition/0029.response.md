Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (3 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `A` is `[x]`**.

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Given the initial state, `x` is defined as `A[len(A) - 1] + (3 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. After appending `x` to `A`, the length of `A` increases by 1, making `A` contain only the value `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
