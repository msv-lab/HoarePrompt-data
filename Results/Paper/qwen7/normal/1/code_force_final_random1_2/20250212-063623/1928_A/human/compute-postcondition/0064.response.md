Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the loop continues until `b1` equals `a`, at which point the function terminates.
