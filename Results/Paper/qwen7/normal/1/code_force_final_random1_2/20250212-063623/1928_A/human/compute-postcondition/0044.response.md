Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, and if `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2, resulting in `b1` and `b2`, where `b1` and `b2` are equal. If `b1` (which is `b // 2`) is not equal to `a`, the condition remains as is.
