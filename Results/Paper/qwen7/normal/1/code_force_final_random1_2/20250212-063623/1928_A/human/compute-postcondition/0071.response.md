Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a value for `t` (the number of sub-cases) and then `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b`. The function processes each pair of `a` and `b` and returns a result for each, but since the specific operation to be performed on `a` and `b` is not detailed, the focus here is on the structure and input handling of the function.
