Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute `t` times because `int(input())` will be equal to `t`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute `t` times.
   - This means `int(input())` must be equal to `t`.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
