Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, and if `a` is even, `a` is replaced by `a // 2` and `a2` is also `a // 2`. If `a1` (which is `a // 2`) is not equal to `b`, the loop continues.
