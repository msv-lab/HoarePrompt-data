You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(t\), \(a\), and \(b\), where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). For each test case, it reads the values of \(a\) and \(b\), and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it outputs a sequence of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle for each test case.

2. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'.
   - It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is exactly equal to the smaller dimension (i.e., `(a - b == -min(a, b)` or `(b - a == -min(a, b))`). If true, it prints 'no'.
   - It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd (`(a - b) % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'.

3. **Conditions for "No":**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Case 1: Both Dimensions Even**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, the program correctly identifies that a new rectangle can be formed by cutting the original rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles and rearranging them. This is correct.

2. **Case 2: Difference Between Dimensions Equals Smaller Dimension**
   - If the difference between `a` and `b` is exactly equal to the smaller dimension, the program incorrectly prints 'no'. However, this condition should not trigger a 'no' because the difference being equal to the smaller dimension does not necessarily mean no new rectangle can be formed. For example, a 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles and reformed into a 4x2 rectangle, but the condition here is flawed.

3. **Case 3: Difference Between Dimensions is Odd**
   - If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the program correctly prints 'yes' because an odd difference means one dimension is larger than the other by an odd amount, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle through rearrangement.

4. **Default Case:**
   - The default case where none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'no', which is also correct under the given logic.

### Conclusion:

The program has a flaw in the second condition where it incorrectly prints 'no' when the difference between `a` and `b` is exactly equal to the smaller dimension. This condition should not lead to a 'no' because it does not necessarily mean no new rectangle can be formed.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
