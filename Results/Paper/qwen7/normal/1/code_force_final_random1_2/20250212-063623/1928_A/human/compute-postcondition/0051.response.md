Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
