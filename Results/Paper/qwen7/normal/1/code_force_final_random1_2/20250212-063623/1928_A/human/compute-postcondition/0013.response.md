Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `b` is the second integer input split from the input string.
- Both `a` and `b` are even.
- The difference between `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b`, it will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
