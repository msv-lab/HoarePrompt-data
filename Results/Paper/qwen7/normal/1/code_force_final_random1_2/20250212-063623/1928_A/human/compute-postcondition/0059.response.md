Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `b1` and `b2` the value of `b // 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `a1`, `a2`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new variables introduced are `b1` and `b2`, both set to `b // 2`.
