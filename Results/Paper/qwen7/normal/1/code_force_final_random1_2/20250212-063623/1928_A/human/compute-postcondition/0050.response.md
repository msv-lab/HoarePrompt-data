Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `t` times. At the end of each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Variables Inside the Loop**:
   - `a` is the integer entered first after the space.
   - `b` is the integer entered second after the space.
   - Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, `b` may be modified (divided by 2 if it is even) and then split into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` if it is even. However, the key point here is that these modifications happen inside the loop, and the loop itself only decrements `t`.

Given this information, let's determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `t` will be reduced by 1 because the loop runs from `range(t)` and decrements `t` at each iteration.
- `a` and `b` remain the same as they were at the start of the current iteration since their values are not modified by the loop itself but by operations inside the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) (one less than the previous value), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space**.
