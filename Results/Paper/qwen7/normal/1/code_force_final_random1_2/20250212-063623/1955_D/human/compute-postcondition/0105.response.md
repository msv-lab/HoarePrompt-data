Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in b_values`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`
   - `ans` is 0
   - `curr` is 0
   - `cnt_b` is a dictionary with key `0` and value `0`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i in b_values`) depends on the values in `b_values`. However, since we don't have the exact values of `b_values`, we can only adjust `i` based on the given information.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary with key `0` and value `0`**.
