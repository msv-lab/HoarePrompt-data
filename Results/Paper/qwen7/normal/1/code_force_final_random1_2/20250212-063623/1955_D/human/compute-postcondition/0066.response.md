Postcondition: `i` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. No changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` if `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`.
