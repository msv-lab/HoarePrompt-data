Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. The list `a` is also unaffected by this operation.
