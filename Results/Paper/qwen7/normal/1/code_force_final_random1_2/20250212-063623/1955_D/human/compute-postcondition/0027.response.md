Output State: **`i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `m` must be the same, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `i` was `i + 1`, so now it becomes `i + 1 + 1`. The value of `m` remains the same, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, as per the initial state conditions.
