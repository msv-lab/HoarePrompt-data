Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `i` is `m - 1` and `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that the count of `a[i]` (where `i` is `m - 1`) in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1.
