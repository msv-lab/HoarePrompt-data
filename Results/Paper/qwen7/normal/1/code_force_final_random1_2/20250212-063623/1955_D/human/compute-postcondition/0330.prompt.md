Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is the final count of iterations where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and it is either equal to the initial `curr` value minus the number of times `curr` was decremented (which is the number of iterations where `curr` became less than `k`), `i` is equal to `n - m - 1`, `n - m` must be greater than or equal to `m`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, and the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now less than or equal to 0 for all elements `a[i + m]` where `i + m < n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is one of the values in `b_values`; `cnt_b[i]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is one of the values in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
