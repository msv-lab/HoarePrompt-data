Output State: **`i` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `curr` is `curr + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The state of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` being decremented by 1 is not directly affected by the line `curr += 1`, so it is not mentioned in the output state.
