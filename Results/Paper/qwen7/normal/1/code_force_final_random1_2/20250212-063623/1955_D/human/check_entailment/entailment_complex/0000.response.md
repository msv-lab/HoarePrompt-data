Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes `cnt_b` with zeros and reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Counting Occurrences of Elements in `b`**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Check**: The program uses a sliding window approach to check if there are at least `k` elements in the current window of `a` that are also in `b`. This is done by maintaining a `curr` counter which is incremented when an element in the window matches one in `b` and decremented when an element leaves the window. If `curr` is at least `k`, the window is considered "good".

4. **Resetting Counters**: After processing each test case, the program correctly resets the `cnt_b` array for the next test case.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the count of good subsegments for each test case, which is correct based on the logic implemented.

Given the above points, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the code.

Correctness: **True**
