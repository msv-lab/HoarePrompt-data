Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n - m` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0.
   - `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can continue, which means `i` should still be less than `n - m`.
   - The other variables (`cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans`) will be updated based on the loop body, but we don't know the exact values yet.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n - m` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - The conditions for updating `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` will be evaluated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**.
