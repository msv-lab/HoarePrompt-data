Output State: **`m` is a positive integer; `i` is `m - 1`; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt_b[b[i]]` being the original value plus 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is `m - 1`, `b[i]` refers to the element `b[m - 1]`. The value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` (which is `cnt_b[b[m - 1]]`) is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
