Output State: **`i` is 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `i` is 0, it means that `b[0]` is being accessed and its count is being incremented. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged, and `m` still needs to be greater than 0.
