Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, and `curr` is increased by 1.**

The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `curr`, it is simply stated that `curr` is increased by 1. All other variables (`a`, `i`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
