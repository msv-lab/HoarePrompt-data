Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `b_values` is decremented by 1 at the index equal to `a[0]` (if `a[i]` is in `b_values`)
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(m)`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `i < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Since `m` is greater than 0, the loop can still execute if `i` is less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `a` remains a list of integers
   - `b_values` is decremented by 1 at the index equal to `a[0]` (if `a[2]` is in `b_values`)
   - `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0

**State:**
**`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is decremented by 1 at the index equal to `a[0]` (if `a[2]` is in `b_values`), and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0**
