Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `m - 2`
   - `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`
   - `ans` is increased by 1
   - `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative
   - No changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` if `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n - m`. Given that `i` is now `m - 1`, `n` must be greater than `2 * m - 1` (as it was before).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `m - 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than `2 * m - 1`.
   - `ans` is already increased by 1, so it remains unchanged.
   - `curr` will be incremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` (which is `a[2*m-1]`) is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative**
