Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `curr` is `curr` + 1.**

The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since the initial value of `curr` is not specified, we represent it as `curr` + 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
