Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the range of `a`.
   - `b_values` is a set of integers.
   - `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be increased by 1.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b_values`, and `curr`) do not change for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a` (i.e., `i+1`), `b_values` is a set of integers, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i+1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i+1]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
