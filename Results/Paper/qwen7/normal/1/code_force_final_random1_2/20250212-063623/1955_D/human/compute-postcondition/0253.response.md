Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The range of the loop is `range(m)`, meaning `i` will iterate from 0 to `m-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body checks if `a[i]` is an element of the list `b_values`.
   - If `a[i]` is found in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was initially non-negative, `curr` is increased by 1.
   - If `a[i]` is not found in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a[i]` is an element of the list `b_values`.
   - If `a[i]` is found in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was initially non-negative, `curr` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `a[i]` will be checked again.
   - `b_values` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt_b` and `curr` may change based on the condition in the loop body, but these changes are not relevant for adjusting the state of the loop itself.

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is `i + 1`** (assuming `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we express it in terms of the increment:

**State:**
**`i` is `i + 1`**.

This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
