Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be the same, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The initial state mentions that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented by 1. The variable `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1.
