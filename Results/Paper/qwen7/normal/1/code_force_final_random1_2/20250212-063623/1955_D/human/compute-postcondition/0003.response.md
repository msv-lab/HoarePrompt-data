Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user input and splits them using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the values provided by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.
