Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the constant `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**: The postcondition describes what happens inside the loop body based on the value of `a[i]` relative to `b_values` and `cnt_b`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - The variable `m` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined before the loop.

5. **Check the postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented from its current value to `i + 1`. Since `m` does not change, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `m` remains the same.

Since `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` are not part of the loop head, their values remain unchanged.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be the same**
