Output State: **`i` is either `m` or `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is 0 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1, while keeping the other variables as specified in the initial state.
