Output State: **The loop has executed `m` times; `i` is `m - 1`; `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`; for each element `b[i]` in the list `b`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `b[i]` in the list `b`; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `m`, `i`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
