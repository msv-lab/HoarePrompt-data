Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `t`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
