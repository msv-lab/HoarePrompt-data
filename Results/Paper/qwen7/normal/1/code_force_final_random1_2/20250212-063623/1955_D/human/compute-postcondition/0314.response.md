Postcondition: **`ans` is either 1 or 2, `curr` is decremented by 1 (so `curr` is now `curr - 1`), `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `n - m` must be greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now less than or equal to 0, and the next element `a[i + m]` is also present in `b_values`; if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is decremented by 1.**
