Output State: **`i` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
