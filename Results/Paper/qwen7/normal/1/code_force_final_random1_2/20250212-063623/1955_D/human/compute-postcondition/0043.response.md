Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to `m - 1`, `m` will remain the same, for each element `b[i]` in the list `b`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be decremented by 1 for every occurrence of `b[i]` in the list `a` where `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative, and `curr` will be the total count of such occurrences. Additionally, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` will be incremented by 1.**
