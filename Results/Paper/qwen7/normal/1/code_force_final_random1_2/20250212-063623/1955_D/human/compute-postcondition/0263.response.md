Output State: **`ans` is 1, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and it is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by this line of code.
