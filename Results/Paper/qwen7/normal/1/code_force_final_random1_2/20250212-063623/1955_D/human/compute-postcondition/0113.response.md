Output State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `curr` is `0`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key from `0` to `n - m - 1` (inclusive) has a value of `0`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The newly created list `a` contains the integers read from the input.
