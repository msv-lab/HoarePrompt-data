Output State: **`i` is -1, `n - m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and is now greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` (which is assumed to be `i` based on the context) is decremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0. After executing `curr -= 1`, `i` becomes -1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
