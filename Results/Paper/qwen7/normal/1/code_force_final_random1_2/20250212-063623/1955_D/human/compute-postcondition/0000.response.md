Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000**.

The code sets the variable `max_val` to the integer value 1000000. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
