Output State: **`ans` is 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, `i` is equal to `m`, `n - m` must be greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now less than or equal to 0, and the next element `a[i + m]` is also present in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Since `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was previously greater than or equal to 0 and is now less than or equal to 0, it means the count has been reduced by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
