Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and it is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 1, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and it is either equal to `curr + 1` (if the condition in the if statement is true) or remains unchanged (if the condition in the if statement is false), and it is still greater than or equal to `k` minus 1, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `n - m` must be greater than `m - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is either greater than or equal to 0 (if the condition in the if statement is true) or is decreased by 1 and is now less than or equal to 0 (if the condition in the if statement is false), and the next element `a[i + m]` is also present in `b_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `curr` is decremented by 1, `i` is equal to `m`, `n - m` must be greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now less than or equal to 0, and the next element `a[i + m]` is also present in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or 2, `curr` is decremented by 1 (so `curr` is now `curr - 1`), `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `n - m` must be greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now less than or equal to 0, and the next element `a[i + m]` is also present in `b_values`; if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is decremented by 1, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
