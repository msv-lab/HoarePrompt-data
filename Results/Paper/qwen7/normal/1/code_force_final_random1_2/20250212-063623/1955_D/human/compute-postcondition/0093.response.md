Output State: **`i` is either `m` or `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1. Initially, `curr` is 0 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0. Since `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, it implies that `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was indeed greater than 0 before the decrement. Therefore, `curr` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
