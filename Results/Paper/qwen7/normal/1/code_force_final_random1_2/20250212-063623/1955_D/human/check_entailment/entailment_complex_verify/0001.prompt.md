You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: All values in `cnt_b` are 0, `curr` is 0, `ans` retains the value it had after the last iteration of the loop, and `n` and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `cnt_b` will have been reset for each element in `b_values`, making all its values 0. The variable `curr` will be reset to 0 after the last iteration. The variable `ans` will retain the value it had after the last iteration of the loop, as no further changes are specified for `ans` beyond what was described for the first three iterations. The variables `n` and `m` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it compares elements from two lists \(a\) and \(b\). It counts the occurrences of elements in \(b\) and checks if a sliding window of size \(m\) in list \(a\) contains at least \(k\) elements also present in \(b\). The function prints the total count of such windows across all test cases. After processing each test case, it resets the count for elements in \(b\) and keeps track of the current count of matching elements within the sliding window.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of size `n` and the array `b` of size `m`.

2. **Counting Occurrences of Elements in `b`:**
   - It creates a counter array `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` initialized to zero.
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - It maintains a current count `curr` of how many elements in the current window match any element in `b`.
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and updates `curr` based on whether the elements are in `b`.

4. **Checking Initial Window:**
   - If the initial window of size `m` has at least `k` matching elements, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Sliding the Window:**
   - For each subsequent position of the window, it adjusts `curr` by removing the leftmost element and adding the rightmost element of the new window.
   - It checks if the new window has at least `k` matching elements and updates `ans` accordingly.

6. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing all windows, it resets the counts for the next test case.

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:

- **Test Case Handling:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by resetting the counts between them.
- **Window Sliding:** The sliding window technique is implemented correctly to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
- **Matching Elements:** The logic for counting and checking matching elements is correct.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The program correctly handles the boundaries of the sliding window and updates the counts appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check each subsegment of `a` of length `m` for having at least `k` matching elements from `b`.
