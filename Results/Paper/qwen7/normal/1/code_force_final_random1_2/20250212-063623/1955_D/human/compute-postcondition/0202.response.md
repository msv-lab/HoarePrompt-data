Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]] > 0` and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**.

This means that the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain as described in the initial state, with the exception of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` being decremented.
