Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
