Output State: **nx is a string of length n, and j is equal to n.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will have incremented from 1 to `n+1` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive), but since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time and starts from 1, `j` will end up being `n` after the loop finishes. The string `nx` will be constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, but since the loop has completed all its iterations, `nx` will be a final string of length `n` formed according to the rules specified within the loop body.
