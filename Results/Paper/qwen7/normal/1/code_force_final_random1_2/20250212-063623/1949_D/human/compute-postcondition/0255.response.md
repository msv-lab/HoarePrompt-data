Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is 4. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is either 'FSF' or 'SFS' depending on the value of `xx[3][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'FS' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?', otherwise `nx` is 'FS' concatenated with 'S'.
