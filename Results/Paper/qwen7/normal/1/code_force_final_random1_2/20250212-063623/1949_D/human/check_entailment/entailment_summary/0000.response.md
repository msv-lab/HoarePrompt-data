Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the input and processes it to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each pair of scenarios. This is done using the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **List Construction**: The program constructs two lists, `sa` and `sb`, which represent the indices of scenarios where 'F' and 'S' are predominant, respectively. This step ensures that the distribution of 'F' and 'S' is balanced according to the problem's requirements.

3. **Decision Making**: Based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, the program decides whether to prioritize 'F' or 'S' for the undecided transitions ('?'). This decision-making process is crucial for ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios.

4. **Output Generation**: The program generates the final output by iterating over each line and replacing '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on the prioritization determined earlier. The conditions used to decide whether to replace '?' with 'F' or 'S' are logically sound and align with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the number of undecided transitions is less than \( \frac{n}{4} \) by appending additional indices to `sa` or `sb`. This ensures that the prioritization logic works even when the number of undecided transitions is small.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly and should produce valid outputs for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
