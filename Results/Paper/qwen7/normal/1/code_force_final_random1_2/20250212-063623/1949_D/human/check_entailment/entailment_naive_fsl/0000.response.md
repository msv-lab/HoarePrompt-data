Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all cases. Specifically, the logic for assigning the types of undecided transition videos (marked with '?') is flawed. 

Consider the following input:

```
5
.F?S?
.?S?.
S?.?.
?S?.F
??.?.
```

The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' to undecided '?' marks based on certain conditions, but it does not ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. 

For instance, in the given input, if we consider the permutation of scenarios as 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, the resulting sequence of transition videos would be:

```
.FFFFF
.FFFFF
.SSSSS
.SSSSS
.FFFFF
```

Here, for the permutation 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, the sequence of transition videos is `FFFFF SSSSS FFFFF`, which violates the condition of having no more than 4 consecutive videos of the same type (since \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\)).

Thus, the program does not guarantee the required condition for all permutations of scenarios, making it incorrect.
