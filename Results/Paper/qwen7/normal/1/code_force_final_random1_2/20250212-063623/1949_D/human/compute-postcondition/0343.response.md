Postcondition: `j` is 3, `nx` is a string, and `n` is greater than 0. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to a string containing 'F' appended to whatever was previously stored in `nx`. Otherwise, if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, no change is made to `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` remains unchanged.
