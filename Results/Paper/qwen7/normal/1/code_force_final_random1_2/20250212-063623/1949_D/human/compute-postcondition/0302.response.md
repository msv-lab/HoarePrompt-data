Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2 or 3.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `nx` is determined based on the conditions given.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2 or 3, the next value of `j` would be 3 or 4 respectively.
   - `n` remains the same as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `nx` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j` in the next iteration, but its exact value is not relevant for adjusting the loop head states.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be 3 (since it was 2 in the previous iteration and will increment to 3).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `nx` is not part of the loop head and its value will be recalculated in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer**.
