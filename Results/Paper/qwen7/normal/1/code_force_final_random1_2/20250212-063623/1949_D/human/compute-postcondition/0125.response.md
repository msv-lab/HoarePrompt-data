Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is still 0; `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0; `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2; `sb` is a list containing the integer 1 and 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contained the integer 1. After appending 2, `sb` now contains both 1 and 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
