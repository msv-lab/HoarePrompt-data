Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments `nx` by the character at `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 3, `j - 1` is 2. Therefore, `nx` is updated by appending the character at `xx[3][2]` to its current value. Since `nx` initially is either 'F' or 'S', the final value of `nx` will be one of these strings followed by the character at `xx[3][2]`.
