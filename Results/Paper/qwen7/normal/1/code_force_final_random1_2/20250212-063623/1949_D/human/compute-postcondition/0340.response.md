Output State: **`j` is 3, `nx` is a string containing 'F' appended to whatever was previously stored in `nx`, `n` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is assigned the value of its current value plus the string `'F'`. Since no initial value for `nx` is given, it is assumed to be an empty string or a string that already contains some value. The variable `j` remains unchanged and is still 3. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
