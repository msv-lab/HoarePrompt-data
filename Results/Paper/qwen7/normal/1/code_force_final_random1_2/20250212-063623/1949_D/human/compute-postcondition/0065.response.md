Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `b[2]` remains unchanged, `b[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not defined in the given context, we cannot specify which element of the list `b` is being modified. However, we know that `b[2]` remains unchanged, so `i` is not equal to 2. The values of `j`, `n`, and `b[2]` remain the same as their initial states.
