Output State: **`i` is 2, `nx` is 'F', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
