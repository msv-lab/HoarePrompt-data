Postcondition: `i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2; `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the same as the precondition.
