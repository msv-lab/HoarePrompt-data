Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from `1` to `n+1`) for which `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. The list `sb` is a list containing the single integer `1`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integer 1, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0. If `a[2]` is 0 and `b[2]` is 0, then no changes are made to the lists. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and 3, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
