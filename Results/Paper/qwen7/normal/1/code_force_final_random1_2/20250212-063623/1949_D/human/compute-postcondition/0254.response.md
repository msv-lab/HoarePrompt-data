Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is 'FS' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?', otherwise `nx` is 'FS' concatenated with 'S'.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is initially either 'F' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?', or 'SF' or 'FS'. The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to `nx`. Therefore, if `nx` was 'F' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]`, it becomes 'FS' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]`. If `nx` was 'SF' or 'FS', it becomes 'FS' or 'FS'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
