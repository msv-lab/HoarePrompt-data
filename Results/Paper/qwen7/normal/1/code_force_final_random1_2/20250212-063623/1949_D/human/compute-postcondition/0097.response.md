Output State: **`x` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the list `x` such that `j` is now `j + 2`, and `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The value of `j` is updated to `j + 2`. The state of `x` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `j` is used to increment `a[j]`.
