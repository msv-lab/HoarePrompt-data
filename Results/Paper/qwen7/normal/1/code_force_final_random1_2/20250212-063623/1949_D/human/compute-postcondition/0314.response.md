Output State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`; `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `nx` as an empty string, which does not affect the values of `i` and the condition that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must still be less than `n + 1`, while `nx` is set to an empty string.
