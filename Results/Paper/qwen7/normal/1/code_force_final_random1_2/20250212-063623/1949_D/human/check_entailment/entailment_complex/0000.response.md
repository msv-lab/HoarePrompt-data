Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to fill in the undecided transition videos ('?') such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur, regardless of the order of scenarios.

2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code initializes some variables and reads the input.
   - It counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' at each position using lists `a` and `b`.
   - Based on the counts, it creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to identify positions where 'F' or 'S' should be placed.
   - The logic in the if-else block decides whether to prioritize 'F' or 'S' based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`.
   - For each position, it constructs a new string `nx` by checking the original input and deciding whether to use 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The code correctly handles the counting of 'F' and 'S' and identifies positions where decisions need to be made.
   - The decision-making logic ensures that the resulting sequence meets the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S'.
   - The code constructs the output strings based on the conditions, ensuring that '?' is replaced appropriately.

4. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.
   - The logic in the if-else block ensures that the conditions are met for all possible permutations of scenarios.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality and adheres to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
