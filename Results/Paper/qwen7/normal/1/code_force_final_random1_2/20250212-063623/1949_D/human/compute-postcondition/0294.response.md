Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1 or 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j-1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `j` is 2, and `nx` is 'S' if either `i` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since `j` can be either 1 or 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2 (if it was 1) or 3 (if it was 2).

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range defined by the loop head, which is `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - Since `j` can be 2 or 3 at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `j` is still within this range.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (1 or 2).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a loop control variable and does not change within the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- If `j` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `j` was 2, it will become 3.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 2 or 3, and `n` is a positive integer. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j-1]`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `j` is 3, and `nx` is 'S' if either `i` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
