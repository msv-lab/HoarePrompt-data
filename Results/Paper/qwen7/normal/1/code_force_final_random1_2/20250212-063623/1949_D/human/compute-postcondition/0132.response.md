Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is now greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` remains greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1, 3, `sb` is a list containing the integers 1, 3.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Since `i` was already 3, appending it to `sb` results in `sb` containing the integers 1, 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
