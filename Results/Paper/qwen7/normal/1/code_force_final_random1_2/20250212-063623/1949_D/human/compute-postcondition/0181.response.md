Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is 'FFSF', `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Initially, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FSS'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'FFS' or 'FSSF'. Since the exact value of `n` does not affect the string `nx`, it remains a positive integer. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
