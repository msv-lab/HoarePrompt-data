Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is assumed to be a numeric value (as per the context). The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
