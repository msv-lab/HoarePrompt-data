Output State: **`x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 4 if `x[2]` is 'S', otherwise `j` is 3, `a[j]` is increased by 1, `a[4]` or `a[3]` is 1 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. The value of `j` depends on the character at index 2 of the string `x`. If `x[2]` is 'S', then `j` is 4, otherwise `j` is 3. Therefore, `a[4]` or `a[3]` will be increased by 1.
