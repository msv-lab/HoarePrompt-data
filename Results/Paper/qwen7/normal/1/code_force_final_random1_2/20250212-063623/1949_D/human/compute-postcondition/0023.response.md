Postcondition: `x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0. If `x[3]` (since `j-1` equals 3) is equal to 'S', then there is an error because `i` is not defined. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.
