Output State: **`nx` is increased by `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same, the value of `nx` is unknown but will be determined by the loop body when `j` is `n + 1`.**

This means that the value of `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value, where `j` is now `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the exact value of `nx` is not known until the loop continues and `j` reaches `n + 1`.
