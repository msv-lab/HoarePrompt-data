Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sa` is an empty list, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` strings, each being the input received at each iteration of the loop, the lists `a` and `b` are updated such that for each index `i` from `1` to `n+1`, `a[i]` represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b[i]` represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs; `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is 0, `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the integer 1, and `sb` is a list containing the integer 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is now greater than 0; `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` remains greater than 0; `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2; `sb` is a list containing the integer 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is now greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` remains greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1, 3, `sb` is a list containing the integer 1. If `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sa` is updated to contain the integers 1, 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
