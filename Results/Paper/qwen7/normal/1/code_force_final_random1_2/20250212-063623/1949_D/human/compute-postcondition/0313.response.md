Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range of its iteration, which is from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state of `nx` is determined by the concatenation rules described. However, since we are focusing on the loop head, we only need to consider how the state of `i` changes.

3. **Update the State of `i`**: Since the loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n + 1`, after the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.

4. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given this information, let's update the state:

- The previous state of `i` was `previous_i`.
- After the previous iteration, `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is `previous_i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`.

**State:**
- `nx` is constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, but since we are focusing on the loop head, we don't need to explicitly state `nx`.
- `i` is `previous_i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `previous_i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`**
