Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `(xx[i][j - 1] == '?')`. Additionally, either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4]`; `nx` is a string with an additional 'S' appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is assigned a new value by appending 'S' to its current content. All other conditions and ranges remain unchanged.
