Output State: **`j` is 2 or 3, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is 'SS' if `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', and 'S' if `xx[i][j-1]` is '?' and either `i` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]; otherwise, `nx` is 'FS'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state sets `j` to either 2 or 3 and `n` as a positive integer.
- The condition `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the existing value of `nx`.
- If `xx[i][j-1]` was not '?', `nx` already had a value, and now it gets appended with 'S', making it 'SS'.
- If `xx[i][j-1]` was '?', `nx` was set to 'S' initially, and now it gets appended with 'S', making it 'SS'.
- The conditions for setting `nx` to 'S' or 'FS' based on the ranges of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state reflects that `nx` has been modified to 'SS' if it was not initially '?', and the conditions for `nx` being 'S' or 'FS' based on the ranges of `i` and `j` are preserved.
