Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from `1` to `n+1`) for which `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing the single integer `1`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is a string composed of 'F' and 'S' characters, `j` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 2, `nx` is a string that is constructed by appending either 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 1 to `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' for all iterations. The final value of `nx` will be a concatenation of 'F' or 'S' for each iteration, depending on whether `i` or `j` (which becomes `n + 1` at the end) is in the first quarter of the list `sa` or if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `nx` will be a string constructed based on the conditions within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
