Output State: **sb is [1, 2, 3, ..., n+1].**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `sb` will contain the list of integers from 1 to `n+1`. This is because for every `i` from 1 to `n+1`, the loop added `i` to `sb` when both `a[i]` and `b[i]` were `0`. Since the problem statement guarantees that `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for each `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `sb` will end up being a list containing all integers from 1 to `n+1`.
