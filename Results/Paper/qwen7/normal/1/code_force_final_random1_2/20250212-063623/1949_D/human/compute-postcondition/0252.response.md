Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is either 'FSF' or 'SFS' depending on the value of `xx[3][2]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?'. Therefore, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[3][3]`. Depending on the value of `xx[3][3]`, `nx` will be updated to either 'FSF' or 'SFS'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
