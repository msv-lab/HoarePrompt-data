Output State: **`n` is an integer input received; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the existing list `a` or the value of `n`. Therefore, `a` remains a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, and `n` retains its value as the integer input received.
