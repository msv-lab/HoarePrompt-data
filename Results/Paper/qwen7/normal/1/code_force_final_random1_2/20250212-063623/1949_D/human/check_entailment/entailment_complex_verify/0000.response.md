### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided examples to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of scenarios \( n \) and the partial transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' at each position across all inputs.
   - It also stores the input lines in the list `xx`.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S':**
   - For each input line, it increments the count of 'F' and 'S' at each position.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` represent the total number of times 'F' and 'S' appear at position `i-1` across all inputs.

3. **Identifying Undecided Transition Videos:**
   - It identifies positions where 'F' or 'S' is already decided (non-zero values in `a` or `b`).
   - It creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store indices where 'F' or 'S' is already decided.

4. **Assigning Types to Undecided Transition Videos:**
   - Based on the length of `sa` and `sb`, it decides whether to prioritize 'F' or 'S'.
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it assigns 'F' to undecided positions where either `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'S' to undecided positions where either `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sb`.

5. **Constructing the Final Transition Video Plan:**
   - It constructs the final transition video plan by replacing '?' with the assigned type ('F' or 'S').

#### Verification Using Provided Examples

Let's verify the program using the provided example inputs.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
5
.F?S?
.?S?.
S?.?.
?S?.F
??.?.
```

- The program processes the input and updates `a` and `b`:
  ```
  a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

- It identifies undecided positions and creates `sa` and `sb`:
  ```
  sa = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  sb = [1]
  ```

- Since `len(sa) > len(sb)`, it assigns 'F' to undecided positions where either `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sa` (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

- Constructing the final transition video plan:
  ```
  .FFFF
  FFFFF
  SSSSS
  SSSSS
  FFFFF
  ```

- Checking the permutation 1, 3, 5, 2, 4:
  ```
  .FFFF
  .FFFF
  SSSSS
  SSSSS
  .FFFF
  ```

- The sequence `FFFFF SSSSS FFFFF` does not violate the condition since \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\).

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
12
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
.????????.??
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
.??????????
```

- The program processes the input and updates `a` and `b`:
  ```
  a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

- It identifies undecided positions and creates `sa` and `sb`:
  ```
  sa = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
  sb = [1]
  ```

- Since `len(sa) > len(sb)`, it assigns 'F' to undecided positions where either `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sa` (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).

- Constructing the final transition video plan:
  ```
  .SSSFFSSSSFS
  S.SFFSFSFFFS
  SS.SFFFSSSFS
  SFS.FFSSSSFS
  FFFF.FFFFFSF
  FSFFF.SFFSFF
  SFFSFS.SSSFS
  SSSSFFS.SSFS
  SFSSFFSS.SFS
  SFSSFSSSS.FS
  FFFFSFFFFF.F
  SSSSFFSSSSF.
  ```

- Checking the permutation 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5:
  ```
  SSSSSSSSSFS
  ```

- The sequence `SSSSSSSSSFS` does not violate the condition since \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 12}{4} \rceil = 9\).

#### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the assignment of 'F' and 'S' to undecided transition videos while ensuring that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. The provided examples demonstrate that the program meets the requirements.
