Postcondition: **`x` is the input string or integer entered by the user, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0. If `x[2]` is 'F', an error occurs because `i` is not defined, `a` is referenced before assignment. If `x[2]` is 'S', then `j` becomes 4. Otherwise, `j` remains 3 and there is an error because `i` is not defined.**
