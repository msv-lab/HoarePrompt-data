Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS', `j` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state of `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'. The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the current value of `nx`. Therefore, if `nx` was initially 'S', it becomes 'SS', and if `nx` was initially 'F', it becomes 'FS'. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2.
