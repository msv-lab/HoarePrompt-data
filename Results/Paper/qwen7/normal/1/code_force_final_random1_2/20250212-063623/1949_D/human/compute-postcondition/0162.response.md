Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string. After executing the code, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
