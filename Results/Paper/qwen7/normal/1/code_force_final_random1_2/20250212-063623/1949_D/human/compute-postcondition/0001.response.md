Output State: **`n` is now set to the integer input received; `a` is a list of length `n+1` initialized with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` of length `n+1` with all elements set to 0. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input received, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the initialization of the list `a`.
