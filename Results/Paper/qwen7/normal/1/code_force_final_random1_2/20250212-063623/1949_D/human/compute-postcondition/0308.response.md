Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `nx` is a string. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to `nx` plus `xx[0][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing the character 'S' if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or the character 'F' otherwise.
