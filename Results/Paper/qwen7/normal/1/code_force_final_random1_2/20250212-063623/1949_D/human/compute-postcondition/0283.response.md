Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is the value of `xx[i][0]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments `nx` by the value of the element at index `j - 1` in the list `xx[i]`. Given that `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0, so `nx` is incremented by the first element of the list `xx[i]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition that the element at index `j - 1` in the list `xx[i]` is not '?' is still valid.
