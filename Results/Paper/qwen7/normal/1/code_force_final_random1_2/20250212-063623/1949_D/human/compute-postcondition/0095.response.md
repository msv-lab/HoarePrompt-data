Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is a list of strings.
- `j` is an index within the list `x` such that `j` is `j + 1`.
- If the character at index `j-1` in `x` is 'F', then both `a[j]` is increased by 1.
- If the character at index `j-1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n`. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition inside the loop checks the character at index `j-1` in the list `x`.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 2` (since it starts from `1` and increments by `1`).

### Final State:
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `j` is adjusted to `j + 2`.

### Answer:
State: **`x` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the list `x` such that `j` is `j + 2`.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration correctly.
