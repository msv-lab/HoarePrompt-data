Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. The loop condition is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjusting States**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`. Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `j` will be 2.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer**
