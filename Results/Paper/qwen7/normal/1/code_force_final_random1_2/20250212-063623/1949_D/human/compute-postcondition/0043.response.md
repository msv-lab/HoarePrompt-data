Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `x[0]` is 'F', and the value of `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unknown, but the value of `a[i]` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
