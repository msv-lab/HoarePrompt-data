Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FSS'
   - `j` is 2

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `j` is currently 2, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is 2 now, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FSS', `j` is 3**
