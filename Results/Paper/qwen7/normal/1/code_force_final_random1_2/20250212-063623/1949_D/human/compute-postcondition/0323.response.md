Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`; `nx` is 'F'**.

The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since no initial value for `nx` was given, it is assumed to be an empty string before this operation. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
