Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is 3
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'SF' or 'FS'.

Given that `j` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented and the new value of `j` must be less than `n`.

Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 4.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'SF' or 'FS'.**
