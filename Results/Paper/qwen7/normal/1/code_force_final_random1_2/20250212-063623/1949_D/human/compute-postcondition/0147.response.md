Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2
   - `a` is an empty list
   - `b` is an empty list
   - `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2
   - `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i < n`. Since `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be a positive integer that is at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `sa` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the single integer 0**.
