Postcondition: `j` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `nx` is determined as follows:
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'.
