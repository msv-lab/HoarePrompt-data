Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is a positive integer; the value of `a[j]` is incremented by 1; the current value of `x[0]` is 'F'; the value of `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `j` remains 1, `n` remains a positive integer, the value of `a[j]` (which was previously unspecified but now has its value incremented by 1) is updated, the current value of `x[0]` remains 'F', and the value of `a[i]` (which was also incremented by 1) is updated accordingly.
