Postcondition: `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string with an additional 'S' appended to it if either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.
