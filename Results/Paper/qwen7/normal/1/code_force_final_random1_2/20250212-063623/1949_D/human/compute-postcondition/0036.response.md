Output State: The loop will continue to iterate from `j = 5` up to `j = n`. For each iteration, if the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F', `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If the character is 'S', both `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. If the character is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a` and `b`.

After all iterations of the loop, the final output state will be such that:
- `a[j]` will be incremented by 1 for every 'F' found at index `j-1` in `x` for all `j` from 2 to `n`.
- `b[i]` will be incremented by 1 for every 'S' found at index `j-1` in `x` for all `j` from 2 to `n`, and additionally, `b[j]` will also be incremented by 1 for every 'S' found at index `j-1` in `x`.

All other variables and their states outside the loop will remain as they were initially, with no changes made unless explicitly mentioned within the loop.
