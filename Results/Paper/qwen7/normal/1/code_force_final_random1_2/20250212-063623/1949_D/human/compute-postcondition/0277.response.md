Output State: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` contains the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. After all iterations of the loop, `sb` will contain the numbers `1` through `n+1` because the condition `a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0` was met for each `i` from `1` to `n+1`.

This means that for every `i` from `1` to `n+1`, the loop added `i` to `sb` when both `a[i]` and `b[i]` were `0`. Therefore, `sb` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n+1]`.
