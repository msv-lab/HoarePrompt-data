Output State: **`n` is an integer input received; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `xx` is a list containing one empty string.**

Explanation: The line `xx = ['']` initializes the list `xx` with a single element, which is an empty string. All other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
