Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `j` is `n + 2`**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was previously unknown but will be determined by the loop body when `j` is `n + 1`, appending 'S' to it results in `nx` becoming 'S'. Additionally, since `j` is incremented by 1 in the previous line, `j` becomes `n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
