Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` contains the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. After all iterations of the loop, `sb` will contain the numbers `1` through `n+1` because the condition `a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0` was met for each `i` from `1` to `n+1`.

This means that for every `i` from `1` to `n+1`, the loop added `i` to `sb` when both `a[i]` and `b[i]` were `0`. Therefore, `sb` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n+1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `nx` will be a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `nx` will be built by concatenating characters from `xx[i][j-1]` when it is not '?', or appending 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` falls within the first quarter of `sb`.

To elaborate, `nx` starts as an empty string and gets updated in each iteration of the loop. For each `j` from 1 to `n`, if `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', `nx` appends the value of `xx[i][j-1]`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `nx` appends 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[0:n//4]`), otherwise it appends 'F'. After all iterations, `nx` will contain the concatenated result of these operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `nx` will be a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, and `n` will be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nx is a string of length n, and j is equal to n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
