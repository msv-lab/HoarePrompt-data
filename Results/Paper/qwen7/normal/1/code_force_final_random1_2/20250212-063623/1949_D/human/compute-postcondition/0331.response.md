Output State: **`j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1, `n` is greater than 0, the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is 'F', if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'SF', otherwise `nx` is 'FF'**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `nx` could be 'S' or 'F' depending on whether `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. Since `nx` is modified to append 'F', if `nx` was 'S', it becomes 'SF'; if `nx` was 'F', it becomes 'FF'. All other variables remain unchanged.
