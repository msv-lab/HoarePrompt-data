Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is now 0, `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the integer 1, `sb` is a list containing the integer 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sb`. Therefore, `sb` now contains the integer 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
