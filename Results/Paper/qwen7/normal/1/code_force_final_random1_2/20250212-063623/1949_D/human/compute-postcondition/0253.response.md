Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 4, `nx` is either 'FSF' or 'SFS' depending on the value of `xx[3][2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is initially either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character at index `xx[3][2]` if `xx[3][2]` is not '?'. After executing `nx += 'F'`, `nx` will append 'F' to its current value. Therefore, if `xx[3][2]` was not '?', `nx` will become 'FSF'; otherwise, it will become 'SFS'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
