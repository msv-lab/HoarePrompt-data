Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'
   - `j` is 1

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop condition is `j < n + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `i` and `nx` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 2**
