Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is a string containing the character 'F'**.

The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` is not defined before this line, it is treated as a new string. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes a string containing 'F'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
