Postcondition: **`sa` includes all positions where the character 'F' appeared without any preceding 'S', and `sb` contains the integers from 1 to `n+1`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, then `nx` will be a string constructed based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, `sb` will contain the integers from 1 to `n+1`.**
