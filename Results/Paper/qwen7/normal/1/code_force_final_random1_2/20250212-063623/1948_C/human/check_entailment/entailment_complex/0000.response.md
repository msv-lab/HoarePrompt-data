Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the grid cells in a specific manner. However, the logic implemented in the function is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Odd Index Check**: The function iterates only over odd indices (`for i in range(1, n, 2)`). This means it only checks the cells in the first row at odd indices. This is not sufficient because the robot can move to the second row based on the direction of the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Condition Checking**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is checking if the robot can move to the next cell in the same row or the previous cell in the same row. However, this does not account for the possibility of moving to the second row and then moving horizontally.

3. **Movement Logic**: The function should check if the robot can move from the starting cell (1,1) to the target cell (2,n) by considering both the movement within the same row and the transition between rows based on the arrows.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
