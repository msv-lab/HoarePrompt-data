Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `i` is `i + 2`, and the condition for the next iteration should be checked to ensure it meets the requirement (either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'), and either the loop breaks or the condition check continues.**
