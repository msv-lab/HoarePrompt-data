Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters "<" and/or ">"; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters "<" and/or ">"; `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` (which starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time) is less than `n`. After all iterations, if the loop does not encounter any `break` statements (meaning none of the conditions `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were met for any `i`), it will print 'yes'. If any of these conditions are met at any point during the loop, the loop will break and print 'No'.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: **If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., none of the specified conditions are met for any `i`), the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, if any of the conditions `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are met, the output will be 'No'.**

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will execute fully based on the value of `n`. If `n` is even, the loop will run until it reaches `n-1`. If `n` is odd, it will run until `i` is equal to `n-1`.

If during any iteration of the loop (where `i` is in the range 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2), the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. Otherwise, after all iterations, the loop will print 'Yes'.

In summary, if the specified condition is never met throughout the entire loop execution, the final output state will be: The loop completes all iterations and prints 'Yes'. If the condition is met at any point, the loop breaks early and prints 'No'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
