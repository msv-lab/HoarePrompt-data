### Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is checking for specific patterns in the grid that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell (2, n). However, this condition is flawed because:
   - It only checks for two specific patterns (`a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`) which do not cover all scenarios where the robot cannot reach the target.
   - The condition does not account for the robot's movement in both rows and the direction of the arrows.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The program only checks for certain patterns and breaks out of the loop if these patterns are found. This means that if the pattern is not found, it incorrectly assumes that the robot can always reach the target cell, which is not true in all cases.

3. **Missing Key Considerations**: The solution should consider the overall path the robot takes and ensure that it can navigate through the grid to reach the target cell (2, n). The current implementation does not properly handle the robot's movement and the directions of the arrows in both rows.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
