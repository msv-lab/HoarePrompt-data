Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes odd values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer and must be at least 3.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
   - The current value of `i` is such that either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'.
   - The most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.

4. **Determine the next possible value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next possible value of `i` would be `i + 2` if `i` was odd (since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to the next possible value, which is `i + 2`.
   - We need to ensure that the condition for the next iteration is met. For the next iteration, `i` should be such that either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `n` must still be an integer and at least 3.
- `i` should be adjusted to the next possible value, which is `i + 2`.
- The condition for the next iteration should be checked to ensure it meets the requirement.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll use a general form:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `i` is `i + 2`, and the condition for the next iteration should be checked to ensure it meets the requirement (either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<').**
