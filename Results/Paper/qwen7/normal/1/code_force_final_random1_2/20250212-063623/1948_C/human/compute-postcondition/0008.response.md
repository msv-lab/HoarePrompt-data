Output: **No**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, the precondition does not provide any specific values for the variables `a` and `b`. It only states conditions about the indices and characters within these sequences. The `print('No')` statement directly prints the string 'No' without relying on the values of `a` or `b`. Therefore, the output is simply 'No'.
