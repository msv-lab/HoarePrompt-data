### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

1. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `half_n - 2`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the character at `2 * i + 1` in `row1` is `<` and if either the character at `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` in `row2` is `<`.
   - If this condition is met, it immediately returns `'No'`.

2. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the last character in `row1` is `<` and the second-to-last character in `row2` is `<`.
   - If both conditions are true, it returns `'No'`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

- This function reads multiple test cases, processes each one using `func_1`, and collects the results.
- It then prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_1` is supposed to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)` based on the given grid configuration.
- `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the function `func_1` has a logical flaw and does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
- Specifically, it mentions that the function incorrectly returns `'No'` in scenarios where the robot can indeed reach `(2, n)`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly returns `'No'` if the last column of `row1` and the second-to-last column of `row2` both point left. However, this is not a necessary condition for the robot to reach `(2, n)`.
   - The function also incorrectly returns `'No'` if the character at `2 * i + 1` in `row1` is `<` and either the character at `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` in `row2` is `<`.

2. **General Path Analysis**:
   - The function does not account for all possible paths the robot can take. It only checks specific conditions and does not cover all valid movements.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the grid:
```
>>>
>><
```
- The provided function would incorrectly return `'No'` because the last column of `row1` and the second-to-last column of `row2` both point left.
- However, the robot can still reach `(2, 4)` by moving right from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`, then down to `(2, 2)`, and finally right to `(2, 3)` and `(2, 4)`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
