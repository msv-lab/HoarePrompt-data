You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a string `row1`, and a string `row2`. It then calls another function `func_1` for each test case, passing `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments. The results from `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list. Finally, it prints the results from `func_1` for all test cases, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` based on the given rows.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`), checking specific conditions for each column pair `(2*i + 1, 2*i + 2)` and the last column.
   - The conditions checked are:
     - If the arrow in the first row at column `2*i + 1` is `<`, then the arrow in the second row at either `2*i` or `2*i + 2` must also be `<` to prevent the robot from getting stuck.
     - If the arrow in the first row at the last column `n - 1` is `<`, then the arrow in the second row at `n - 2` must also be `<`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, the first row, and the second row, and calls `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It only checks a subset of the grid and does not cover all necessary conditions.
   - Specifically, it only checks pairs of columns and the last column, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. The robot's movement depends on the entire grid configuration, not just these specific pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - While `func_2` correctly processes each test case, it relies on the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Example Test Cases

Let's consider the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Grid: `>>><` (first row) and `>>><` (second row).
  - The robot can reach `(2, 4)` via the path: `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`.
  - The program should output `YES`.

- **Example 2**: 
  - Grid: `><` (first row) and `><` (second row).
  - The robot can reach `(2, 2)` via the path: `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)`.
  - The program should output `YES`.

- **Example 3**: 
  - Grid: `>>><` (first row) and `>><<` (second row).
  - The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)` because the path would get stuck at `(2, 3)`.
  - The program should output `NO`.

- **Example 4**: 
  - Grid: `>><<><` (first row) and `><>>><` (second row).
  - The robot can reach `(2, 6)` via a complex path.
  - The program should output `YES`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not cover all necessary conditions for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. Therefore, the program as given is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
