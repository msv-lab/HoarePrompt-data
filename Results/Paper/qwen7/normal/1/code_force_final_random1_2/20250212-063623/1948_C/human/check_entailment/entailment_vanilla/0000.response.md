Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` based on the given rows.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`), checking specific conditions for each column pair `(2*i + 1, 2*i + 2)` and the last column.
   - The conditions checked are:
     - If the arrow in the first row at column `2*i + 1` is `<`, then the arrow in the second row at either `2*i` or `2*i + 2` must also be `<` to prevent the robot from getting stuck.
     - If the arrow in the first row at the last column `n - 1` is `<`, then the arrow in the second row at `n - 2` must also be `<`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, the first row, and the second row, and calls `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It only checks a subset of the grid and does not cover all necessary conditions.
   - Specifically, it only checks pairs of columns and the last column, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. The robot's movement depends on the entire grid configuration, not just these specific pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - While `func_2` correctly processes each test case, it relies on the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Example Test Cases

Let's consider the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Grid: `>>><` (first row) and `>>><` (second row).
  - The robot can reach `(2, 4)` via the path: `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`.
  - The program should output `YES`.

- **Example 2**: 
  - Grid: `><` (first row) and `><` (second row).
  - The robot can reach `(2, 2)` via the path: `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)`.
  - The program should output `YES`.

- **Example 3**: 
  - Grid: `>>><` (first row) and `>><<` (second row).
  - The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)` because the path would get stuck at `(2, 3)`.
  - The program should output `NO`.

- **Example 4**: 
  - Grid: `>><<><` (first row) and `><>>><` (second row).
  - The robot can reach `(2, 6)` via a complex path.
  - The program should output `YES`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not cover all necessary conditions for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. Therefore, the program as given is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
