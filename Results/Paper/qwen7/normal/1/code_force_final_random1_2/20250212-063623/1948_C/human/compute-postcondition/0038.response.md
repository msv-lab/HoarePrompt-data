Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer and must be at least 3.
- `i` is defined as `i + 2`, but since `i` is not initialized before this operation, it's unclear what the actual value of `i` is. However, the value of `i` after this operation will be `i + 2`.
- The condition for the next iteration checks if either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'. This condition is not relevant to the `print('No')` statement.

Given the `print('No')` statement, it will simply print the string 'No' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **No**
