Output: **No**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` have certain conditions and constraints but do not affect the execution of the `print('No')` statement directly. The statement itself prints the string 'No' regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output is simply 'No'.
