Output State: The loop will execute all iterations based on the value of `n`. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, it will continue to run as long as `i` is less than `n`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs for odd numbers starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

If during any iteration, the condition `i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. Otherwise, after all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking, it will print 'yes'.

The final output state will be:
- `i` will be `n-1`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged
- If the condition was met at any point, the output will be 'No'
- If the condition was never met, the output will be 'yes'

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is unchanged, `a` and `b` are unchanged, and the output will be either 'No' if the condition was met at any point or 'yes' if the condition was never met.
