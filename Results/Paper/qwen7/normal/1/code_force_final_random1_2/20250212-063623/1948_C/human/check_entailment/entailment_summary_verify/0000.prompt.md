You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    4

    >>><

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a string `row1`, and a string `row2`. It then calls another function `func_1` for each test case, passing `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments. The results from `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list. Finally, it prints the results from `func_1` for all test cases, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function checks if the last column of the first row and the second-to-last column of the second row both point left (`<`). This is incorrect because the robot can still reach the bottom-right corner even if these conditions are not met. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   >>>
   >><
   ```
   In this case, the robot can start at (1, 1), move right to (1, 2), and then move down to (2, 2). From (2, 2), the robot can move right to (2, 3) and finally down to (2, 4).

2. **General Path Analysis**: The function only checks a subset of possible paths and does not account for all valid movements. It incorrectly returns 'No' in scenarios where the robot can indeed reach (2, n).

To illustrate, let's consider the test case:
```
4
>>>
>><
```
The provided function would incorrectly return 'No', but the correct path is:
- Start at (1, 1) -> Move right to (1, 2) -> Move down to (2, 2) -> Move right to (2, 3) -> Move down to (2, 4).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
