Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`. All other variables retain their original values.
