Output State: `ops` is an empty list.

Natural Language Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as `ops` is a non-empty list, and it has executed 3 times with `ops` remaining non-empty each time, it implies that `ops` must have become empty after the third iteration. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ops` will be an empty list.
