Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `a` as a list of `n` integers is not altered by this code. Therefore, the list `a` remains unchanged, and its elements still satisfy the condition `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`. The value of `n` is updated to the input integer, and the list `a` retains its initial state.
