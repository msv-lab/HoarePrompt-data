Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, `i` is `r + 1`, and either all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` are equal to `r - l + 1` (if `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`), or `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decreased by 1 after the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called.
