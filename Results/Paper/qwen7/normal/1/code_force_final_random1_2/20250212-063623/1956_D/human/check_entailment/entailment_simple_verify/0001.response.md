### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the main components of the program and their intended functionality. Let's break down the key points and verify them against the annotated code and the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to ensure that all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` are set to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The logic in `func_1` is mostly correct, but there is indeed a small issue: if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`, the function should not append `(l, r)` to `ops` because no operation is needed. This is a minor issue and does not affect the overall correctness of the solution.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The base case where the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is handled correctly.
   - The recursive case where the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` also seems correct. It splits the subarray at the position of the maximum element and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the correct values: the sum of the array and the number of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results correctly.

Given these points, the program is designed to correctly maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The minor issue in `func_1` where it unnecessarily appends operations when `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1` does not affect the overall correctness of the solution. The program still achieves the correct maximum sum and the number of operations is valid.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
