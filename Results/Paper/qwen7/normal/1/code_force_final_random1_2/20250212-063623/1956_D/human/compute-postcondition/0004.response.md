Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `(l, r)` from the `ops` list.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the `ops` list must contain at least one pair of values `(l, r)`. This means that `ops` must not be an empty list.

3. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `s` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s first return.
   - `m` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s second return.
   - `ops` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s third return.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the `ops` list having at least one element, we need to ensure that `ops` is not an empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `ops` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ops` is a non-empty list**
