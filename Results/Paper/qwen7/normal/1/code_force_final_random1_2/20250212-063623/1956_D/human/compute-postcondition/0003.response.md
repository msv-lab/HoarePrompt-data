Based on the initial state provided, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s first return, and `m` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s second return. The `print(s, m)` statement will print the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise values of `s` and `m`. However, we know that `s` and `m` are the results of the function's returns.

Output: **s, m (where s and m are the results of func_2(a)â€™s first and second returns, respectively)**
