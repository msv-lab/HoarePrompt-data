Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, here's the breakdown:

1. The initial state indicates that `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all set to 0.
2. The list `numbers` is initially empty.
3. The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called three times with an unspecified argument `num`. This function presumably distributes numbers into groups `a`, `b`, and `c`, updating `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`.
4. The condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to `True`, indicating that the distribution was successful or meets certain criteria.

The return statement `return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c` suggests that the function is returning a string `'YES'` along with the groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Since the exact values of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are not specified in the initial state, they remain as placeholders in the output state.
