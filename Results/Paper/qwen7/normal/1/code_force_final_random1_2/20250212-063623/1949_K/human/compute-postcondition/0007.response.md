The only objects in the loop head are variables `num` and `numbers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the `numbers` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `sum_a` is 0
- `sum_b` is 0
- `sum_c` is 0
- `numbers` is a non-empty list
- `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num`

For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must still contain at least one element. Therefore, after the next iteration, `numbers` will have one less element.

Let's denote the first element of the `numbers` list as `num_0`. After processing `num_0`, `numbers` will have one less element.

State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, `distribute_number(num_0)` has been called with an argument `num_0`**
