Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of valid moves. The moves are mirrored between the player and the computer, and the configurations are considered different if there is a rook in one configuration but not the other, or if the colors differ.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for smaller boards.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of configurations for an \( i \times i \) board.
   - The function `func_1` populates the `dp` array using a specific recurrence relation.
   - For each test case, the code calculates the number of valid positions left after the initial moves and uses the precomputed `dp` values to find the number of configurations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**:
   - The recurrence relation used is \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \).
   - This relation accounts for adding a new row and column while ensuring no rooks attack each other.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The code correctly handles the input and outputs the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the number of valid positions is zero (resulting in `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`).

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The precomputation of `dp` values up to \( 300000 \) ensures that the solution can handle the maximum \( n \) value.
   - The logic for handling the number of valid positions and using the precomputed `dp` values is correct.

Based on the above analysis, the given program appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
