Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Initially, `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3. For `i = 3`, the value of `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007 = 7 % 1000000007 = 7`. After this calculation, `i` is incremented to 4, but since no further calculation is done for `i = 4` in the given code snippet, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain as initially described.
