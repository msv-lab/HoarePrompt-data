### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a rook and the opponent mirrors the move.
   - The configurations are considered different if there is any cell with a rook in one configuration but not in the other, or if the colors differ.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move invalidates positions in rows and columns.
   - The number of valid positions decreases as more rooks are placed.
   - The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining valid positions.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a DP array to store the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board.
   - The recurrence relation used is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and tracks the invalid positions using a set.
   - The number of valid positions is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - The result is computed using the precomputed DP values.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **DP Initialization and Recurrence Relation:**
     - The base cases \( dp[1] = 1 \) and \( dp[2] = 3 \) are correct.
     - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \) is derived from combinatorial arguments and is correct for counting the number of ways to place rooks in a \( 2 \times i \) rectangle.
   - **Tracking Invalid Positions:**
     - The set `invalid` correctly tracks the positions that are invalidated by the moves.
   - **Computing Valid Positions:**
     - The computation of `n - len(invalid)` correctly determines the number of valid positions.
   - **Using Precomputed DP Values:**
     - The use of precomputed DP values is efficient and correct.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the number of valid positions is zero by ensuring the result is at least 1.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, the implementation correctly follows the problem requirements and uses appropriate dynamic programming techniques to solve the problem efficiently. The logic to track invalid positions and compute the number of valid configurations is sound.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
