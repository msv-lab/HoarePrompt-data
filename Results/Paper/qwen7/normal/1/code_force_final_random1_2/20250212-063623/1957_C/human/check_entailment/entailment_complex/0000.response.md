Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent. The key is to calculate the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the constraints of the problem.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to precompute the number of ways to place rooks on a \(2 \times i\) board.
   - The function `func_1` populates the `dp` array for values up to \(300000\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\), and then reads \(k\) moves. It calculates the number of free positions (i.e., positions not occupied by rooks) and uses the precomputed `dp` array to find the number of configurations.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `dp` array is correctly initialized and populated using a recurrence relation that counts the number of ways to place rooks on a \(2 \times i\) board.
   - The logic to compute the number of configurations after \(k\) moves is sound. It subtracts the number of used rows and columns from \(n\) and uses the precomputed `dp` array to find the number of configurations.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required bounds.
   - The approach considers all valid placements and ensures no two rooks attack each other.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code accurately implements the solution to the problem. It correctly uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations and then applies this to each test case.

Correctness: **True**
