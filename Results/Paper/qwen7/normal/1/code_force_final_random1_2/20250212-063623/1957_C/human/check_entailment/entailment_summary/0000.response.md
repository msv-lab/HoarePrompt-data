Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where the computer mirrors your moves. The key is to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining part of the board, considering the constraints of no two rooks attacking each other.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the number of ways to place rooks on a \( 2 \times i \) grid, which is a simplification of the original problem.
   - The function `func_1` computes the values of `dp` up to `dp[n]`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`, and then calculates the number of valid positions left on the board after the moves. This is done by subtracting the number of invalid positions (where rooks are placed) from `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which gives the number of configurations for the remaining part of the board.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array Calculation**:
   - The base cases are correctly initialized (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation used in the loop is correct: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The logic to compute the number of configurations for the remaining part of the board is correct. Subtracting the number of invalid positions and using the precomputed `dp` array ensures that only valid configurations are counted.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly throughout the calculations to handle large numbers.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
