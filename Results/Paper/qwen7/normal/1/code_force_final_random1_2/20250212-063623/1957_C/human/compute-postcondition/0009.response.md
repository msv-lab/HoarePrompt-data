Output State: **dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 5, dp[4] is 11, dp[5] is 23, dp[6] is 35, and so on until dp[n] has been calculated, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, i is n + 1.**

To understand this output state, let's break it down:

- The initial values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are given as 1 and 3, respectively.
- The loop starts from `i = 3` and continues up to `i = n`, where `n` can be as large as \(3 \times 10^5\).
- For each iteration, the value of `dp[i]` is computed using the formula: 
  \[
  dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
  \]
- After executing the loop for all iterations, `dp` will contain the values for all indices from 1 to `n`.
- The variable `t`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), remains unchanged.
- The variables `n` and `k`, which are integers with \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\), also remain unchanged.
- The variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has finished its execution.
