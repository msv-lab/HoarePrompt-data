### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a rook and the opponent mirrors the move.
   - The configurations are considered different if there is any cell with a rook in one configuration but not in the other, or if the colors differ.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move invalidates positions in rows and columns.
   - The number of valid positions decreases as more rooks are placed.
   - The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining valid positions.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a DP array to store the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board.
   - The recurrence relation used is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and tracks the invalid positions using a set.
   - The number of valid positions is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - The result is computed using the precomputed DP values.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The DP initialization and recurrence relation seem correct for counting configurations.
   - The use of modulo \( 1000000007 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.
   - The logic to compute the number of valid positions and use the DP table is sound.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Invalid Positions Handling:** The program only tracks the positions of rooks and their mirrored positions. This means it does not account for the fact that the rooks are placed in different rows and columns, which affects the number of valid positions.
- **DP Table Initialization:** The DP table is initialized for smaller boards, but the problem requires handling up to \( n = 3 \cdot 10^5 \). The current DP table size is only 300007, which might be insufficient for large \( n \).
- **Recurrence Relation:** The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \) does not directly account for the constraints of the problem. It seems to be a general combinatorial formula without considering the specific constraints of the rook placement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the constraints and the specific nature of the rook placement problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues mentioned above.
