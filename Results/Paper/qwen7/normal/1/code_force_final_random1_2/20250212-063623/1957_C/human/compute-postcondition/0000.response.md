Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, for each test case, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves are valid according to the problem description.**

Explanation: The code initializes `dp[1]` to 1. This changes the value of `dp[1]` from its initial unspecified state to 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
