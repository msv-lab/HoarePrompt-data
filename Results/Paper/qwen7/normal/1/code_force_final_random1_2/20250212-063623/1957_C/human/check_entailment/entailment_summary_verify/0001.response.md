### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the provided function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Restatement
The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You and the computer take turns placing rooks, with the computer mirroring your moves. The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves, modulo \( 1000000007 \).

#### Key Observations
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function `func_1` computes the number of ways to place rooks in a \( 2 \times i \) rectangle using a DP approach.
2. **Invalid Positions**: The program keeps track of invalid positions (rows and columns where rooks are placed) using a set.
3. **Valid Configurations**: The number of valid positions is calculated as \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
4. **DP Table**: The DP table `dp` stores the number of ways to place rooks in a \( 2 \times i \) rectangle, which is used to compute the number of valid configurations for an \( n \times n \) board.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function initializes the DP table `dp` and fills it using the recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).
   - The base cases are \( dp[1] = 1 \) and \( dp[2] = 3 \).
   - The recurrence relation correctly counts the number of ways to place rooks in a \( 2 \times i \) rectangle.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and tracks the invalid positions using a set.
   - The number of valid positions is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - The result is computed using the precomputed DP values from `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The DP approach correctly counts the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board.
   - The use of modulo \( 1000000007 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.
   - The logic to compute the number of valid positions and use the DP table is sound.

#### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The dynamic programming approach and the use of the DP table are appropriate for counting the number of valid configurations.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
