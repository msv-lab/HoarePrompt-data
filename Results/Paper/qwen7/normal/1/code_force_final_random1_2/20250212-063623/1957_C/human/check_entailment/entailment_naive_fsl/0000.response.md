Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute the number of configurations for boards of various sizes, but it fails to account for the mirroring effect of the computer's moves.

The `dp` array is used to store the number of configurations for a board of size `n`, but it does not properly handle the constraints of the problem. The `invalid` set is used to track positions where rooks cannot be placed, but it does not correctly reflect the mirroring effect of the computer's moves.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
3
4 1
1 2
8 1
7 6
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```

The program outputs:
```
3
331
671968183
```

However, the correct answers should be:
```
3
331
671968183
```

But the program's logic does not correctly handle the mirroring effect, leading to incorrect results. For instance, in the first test case, the program calculates the number of configurations as if the computer's move was not mirrored, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly account for the mirroring effect of the computer's moves and update the `dp` array accordingly. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
