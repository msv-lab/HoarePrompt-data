Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `l` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `j` is equal to `l`.
   - `ans` is a list of characters from `alp`.
   - Each character's index in `ans` is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array`, minus 1.
   - The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = l-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from 0 to `l-1`, the character added to `ans` is the one whose index in `alp` is equal to the number of times `rev_array[j]` appears in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array`, minus 1.
   - After the loop, `j` becomes `l` and `l` remains unchanged.

3. **Final State**:
   - Since `j` is set to `l` at the end of the loop, the final value of `j` is `l`.
   - The value of `ans` is constructed based on the counts of `rev_array[j]` in the respective substrings.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `ans` into a single string and prints it.

Given the above steps, let's determine the exact output:

- Suppose `l = 3` (since `l` is greater than or equal to 0, we can assume any non-negative integer, but the exact value doesn't change the logic).
- Let's assume `rev_array` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]` for simplicity.
- For `j = 0`:
  - Count of `rev_array[0]` (which is 1) in the substring `[1, 2, 1, 3]` is 2.
  - Index in `alp` is `2 - 1 = 1`.
- For `j = 1`:
  - Count of `rev_array[1]` (which is 2) in the substring `[2, 1, 3]` is 1.
  - Index in `alp` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
- For `j = 2`:
  - Count of `rev_array[2]` (which is 1) in the substring `[1, 3]` is 1.
  - Index in `alp` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
- For `j = 3`:
  - Count of `rev_array[3]` (which is 3) in the substring `[3]` is 0.
  - Index in `alp` is `0 - 1 = -1` (assuming `alp` has valid indices).

Thus, `ans` would be constructed as follows:
- `ans[0]` corresponds to index `1` in `alp`.
- `ans[1]` corresponds to index `0` in `alp`.
- `ans[2]` corresponds to index `0` in `alp`.
- `ans[3]` corresponds to index `-1` in `alp` (which might be an invalid index, but assuming it's handled appropriately).

However, since the exact `alp` is not provided, we can only describe the general form.

Output: **'100'** (where the exact characters depend on the specific `alp` list, but the indices are derived as described).
