Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases provided by `int(input())`, `j` will be equal to `l` for each test case, `ans` will be a list of characters from the `alp` list, where each character's index is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array`, minus 1 for each `j` from 0 to `l-1`. The `array` will be a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer for each test case, and `rev_array` will be the reversed version of `array` for each test case.
