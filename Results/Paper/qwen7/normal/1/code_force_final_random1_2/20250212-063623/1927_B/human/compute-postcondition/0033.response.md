Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing characters from the `alp` list, where each character's index is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1 for each iteration of `j` from 0 to `l-1`, `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reverse of the original list `array`. All other variables remain unchanged.
