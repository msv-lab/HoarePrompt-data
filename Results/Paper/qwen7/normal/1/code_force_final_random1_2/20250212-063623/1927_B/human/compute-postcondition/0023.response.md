Output State: **`l` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing the character from `alp` list which is at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `j` remains unchanged and is still equal to `l`.
- The variable `ans` is updated by appending a new element to it. This element is the character from the `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` (which is the same as `rev_array[l]`) in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` (or `l`) to the end of `rev_array`.
