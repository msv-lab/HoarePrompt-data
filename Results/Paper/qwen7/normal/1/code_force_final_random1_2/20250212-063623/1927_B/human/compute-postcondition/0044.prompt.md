Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the trace is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list containing the characters from `alp` list at the indices calculated by counting occurrences of each element in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtracting 1, `rev_array` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `l` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing characters from the `alp` list, where each character's index is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1 for each iteration of `j` from 0 to `l-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will be a list of characters from `alp`. For each index `j` from 0 to `l-1`, the character added to `ans` is the one whose index in `alp` is equal to the number of times `rev_array[j]` appears in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array`, minus 1. The variable `j` ends up being `l` after the loop completes, and `l` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing the alphabet characters at the indices calculated by `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` for each `j` from 0 to `l-1`, `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
