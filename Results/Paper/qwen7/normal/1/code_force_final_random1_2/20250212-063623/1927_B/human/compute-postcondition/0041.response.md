Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing the alphabet characters at the indices calculated by `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` for each `j` from 0 to `l-1`, `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to the initial value of `l`. The list `ans` will contain `l` alphabet characters. Each character in `ans` corresponds to the index `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` for each `j` from 0 to `l-1`. The variables `array` and `rev_array` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `i` remains less than the value provided by `int(input())`.
