Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(l)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `l` outside the loop.
   - `l` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `l`. Given this, the loop will run from `j = l` down to `j = 0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is set to `l` initially, the loop will start with `j = l`. For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 (since `range(l)` includes numbers from 0 to `l-1`).
   - Therefore, `l` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `j`.

**Final State**:
State: **`l` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `l`**
