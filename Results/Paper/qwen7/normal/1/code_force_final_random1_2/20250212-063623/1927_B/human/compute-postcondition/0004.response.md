Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `l`, `array` is a list of integers created from the input split and converted to integers, `alp` is a list of characters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed version of `array`**.

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reverse of the original list `array`. The values of `i`, `array`, and `alp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
