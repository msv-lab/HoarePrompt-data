Output State: **`l` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `l + 1`, `ans` is a list containing one additional element where the new element is the character from `alp` list at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `ans` list a character from the `alp` list. The index in `alp` is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the substring of `rev_array` starting from index `j` to the end, and then subtracting 1. The values of `l` and `j` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains one more element than before.
