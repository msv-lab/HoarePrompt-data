Output State: **`l` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` contains the character from `alp` list which is at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `ans` list a character from the `alp` list. The index in `alp` is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring of `rev_array` starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array`, minus 1. The variables `l` and `j` retain their initial relationship (`j` equals `l`), and `ans` now includes the calculated character.
