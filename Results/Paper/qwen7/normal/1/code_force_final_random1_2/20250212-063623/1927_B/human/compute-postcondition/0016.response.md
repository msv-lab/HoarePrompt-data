Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `alp` list at the indices calculated by counting occurrences of each element in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtracting 1, `rev_array` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is equal to `l`, `array` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps those strings to integers, creating a new list called `array`. This new list replaces the value of `array` in the initial state. All other variables (`l`, `ans`, `rev_array`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.
