Output State: **`a[i]` is 0 - `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `6 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `4 * opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `n` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` decrements the value of `a[i + 1]` by `2 * opNum`. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, the decrement operation becomes `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[i]`. Since `a[i + 1]` was initially decremented by `4 * opNum`, its new value is further decremented by `2 * a[i]`, making the total decrement `4 * a[i] + 2 * a[i] = 6 * a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
