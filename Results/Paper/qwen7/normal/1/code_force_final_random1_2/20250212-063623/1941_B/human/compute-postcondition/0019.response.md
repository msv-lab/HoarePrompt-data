Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1, `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer, `b` is updated with the new list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The values of `t`, `a`, `num`, and the previous state of `b` remain unchanged, except that `b` is now updated with the new list of integers.
