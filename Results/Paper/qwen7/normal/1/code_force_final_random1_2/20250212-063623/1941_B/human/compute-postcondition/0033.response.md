Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the (i+1)-th element is decreased by 2 * `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`, `i` is `n-3`; `a[i]` is decreased by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by 2 * `opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is further decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decreases the value of `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
