You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first two elements of the array `a` meet specific conditions: both are odd and the second element equals the first element plus two, or if the last two elements meet similar conditions. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`
     2. `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Operation Description**:
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - This operation decreases the sum of the array by exactly 3.

4. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - The conditions check if the first and last elements of the array have specific parity (odd/even) and value relationships with their adjacent elements.
   - Specifically:
     - `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`: This condition checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
     - `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`: This condition checks if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions without considering the entire array.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of making all elements zero through the described operations.
   - The conditions provided do not cover all scenarios where the array can be made zero.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The conditions provided are insufficient to cover all cases.

**Correctness: False**
