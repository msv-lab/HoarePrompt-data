Postcondition: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by `2 * opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is less than or equal to `-2`, `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1] - 2 * opNum` (if applicable), and all elements `a[i]` for `i` in the range `[0, n-3]` have been processed according to the loop logic, leading to their final decremented values. The condition `a[len(a) - 1] == 0` and `a[len(a) - 2] == 0` is satisfied.**
