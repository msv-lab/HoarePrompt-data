Postcondition: ***`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-3`. The loop exits due to the condition `stop == True`.***
