Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input string split on spaces and converted to integers.
- `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1.
- `a` is reassigned the value of the new input integer.
- `b` is updated with the new list of integers.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
