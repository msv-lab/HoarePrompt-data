Output State: `numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-3`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-3`. The list `a` will have been modified such that for every `i` from `0` to `n-3`, `a[i]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `a[i+1]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, and `a[i+2]` has been decreased by `opNum`. Additionally, the variable `stop` will be set to `True` because the loop breaks as soon as it encounters a negative number in `a`.
