Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`, `stop` is True, and `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The code decrements `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. Since `a[i + 1]` was already decremented by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` was not directly affected by that operation. Now, `a[i + 2]` is further decremented by `opNum`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
