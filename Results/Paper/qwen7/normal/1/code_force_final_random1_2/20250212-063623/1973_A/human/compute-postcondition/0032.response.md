Postcondition: `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, and `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing one element which is `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`.
