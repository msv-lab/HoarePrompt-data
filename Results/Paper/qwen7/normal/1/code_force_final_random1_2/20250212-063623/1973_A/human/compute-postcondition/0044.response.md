Postcondition: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is true, then `resultats` is set to a list containing `-1`. In all cases, the other variables (`total_points`, `egalites`, `p3`, and `total_matchs`) retain their values as described in the precondition.
