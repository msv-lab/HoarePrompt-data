Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points` // 2, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` contains `-1`**.

The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `resultats`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `-1`, `resultats` now contains `-1`. All other variables (`total_matchs`, `total_points`, and `egalites`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
