Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case to determine the number of draws.
2. It checks if the total points are even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable.
3. It ensures that the total number of matches does not exceed 3 (since there are only 3 players).
4. It checks if the highest score `p3` does not exceed the total number of matches.
5. It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`.
6. The provided test cases in the execution summary match the expected outputs based on the logic implemented in the function.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
