Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. Since `resultats` was not defined before, it is initialized as a list containing `-1`. The values of `total_points`, `egalites`, `total_matchs`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from their initial state.
