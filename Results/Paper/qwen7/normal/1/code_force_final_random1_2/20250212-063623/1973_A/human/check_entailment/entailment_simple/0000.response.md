Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `cas_de_test`.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws or returns `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.
3. The logic within the function checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes an even number of points (either 2 points to one player and 0 to another, or 1 point to each player in a draw).
4. It then checks if the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) is feasible and if the highest score (`p3`) is within the limit of possible matches.
5. Finally, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is derived from the difference in scores and the total points.

Given the provided example and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct for determining the maximum number of draws or returning `-1` when the scores are inconsistent. The conditions and calculations align with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
