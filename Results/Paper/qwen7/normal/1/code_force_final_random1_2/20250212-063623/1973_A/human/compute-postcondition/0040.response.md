Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is calculated based on `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; if `total_points % 2 != 0`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. If `total_points % 2 == 0`, `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_matchs` to be `total_points // 2`. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state, with `egalites` and `resultats` depending on the updated `total_matchs` and the original conditions.
