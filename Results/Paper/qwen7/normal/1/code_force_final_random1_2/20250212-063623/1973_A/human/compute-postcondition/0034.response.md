Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `(p1, p2, p3)` from the tuple `cas_de_test`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`. There is no explicit condition given in the loop itself, but we need to ensure that the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` is valid for the next iteration.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`
   - `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`
   - `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`
   - `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing one element which is `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`

4. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the next iteration, the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` must be valid.
   - Since the loop iterates over all tuples in `cas_de_test`, the only thing that changes is the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for the next tuple in the sequence.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `total_matchs` remains unchanged as it is derived from `total_points`, which is derived from the current tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`.
   - `total_points` will be updated based on the new tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`.
   - `egalites` will be recalculated based on the new `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `p3` must be less than or equal to `total_matchs` for the tuple to be valid.
   - `resultats` will be updated based on the new value of `egalites`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` from the next iteration in `cas_de_test`.

**State:**
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2` (unchanged)
- `total_points` is the sum of the new tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`
- `egalites` is calculated based on the new `total_points` and the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`
- `p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`
- `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing one element which is `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`

Since we don't know the exact values of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, we can represent the state generically as follows:

**State:**
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`
- `total_points` is `new_p1 + new_p2 + new_p3`
- `egalites` is `new_total_points - 2 * (new_p3 - new_p2) - 2 * (new_p3 - new_p1)`
- `new_p3` is less than or equal to `total_matchs`
- `resultats` is either `[-1]` if `egalites < 0`, or a list containing one element which is `egalites // 2` if `egalites >= 0`

Where `new_p1`, `new_p2`, and `new_p3` are the values from the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
