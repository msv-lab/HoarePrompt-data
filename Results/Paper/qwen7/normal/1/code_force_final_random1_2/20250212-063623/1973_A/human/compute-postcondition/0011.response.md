Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points` // 2, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` contains [-1], and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by this statement, the values of `total_matchs`, `total_points`, and `resultats` remain unchanged. We simply indicate that the loop continues.
