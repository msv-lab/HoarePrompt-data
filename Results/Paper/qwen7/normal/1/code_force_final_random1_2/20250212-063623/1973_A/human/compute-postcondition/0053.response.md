Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `[p1, p2, p3]` sorted non-decreasingly. It processes each inner list to calculate the number of equalities (`egalites // 2`) based on specific conditions. If any condition is not met, it appends `-1` to the result list. Finally, it returns a list `resultats` containing the valid `egalites // 2` values for each set of `[p1, p2, p3]` in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended wherever the conditions are not met.**
