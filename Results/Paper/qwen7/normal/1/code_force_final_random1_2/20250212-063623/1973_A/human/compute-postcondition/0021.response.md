Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is either `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` with `resultats` containing `-1`, or `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` with `resultats` being a list containing `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` and `egalites` being greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_points` to `p1 + p2 + p3`. All other variables (`total_matchs`, `egalites`, `resultats`, `new_p1`, `new_p2`, `new_p3`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The relationships and conditions involving these variables are preserved.
