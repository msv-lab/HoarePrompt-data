Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `len(arr) - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.

2. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 4`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should still be within the bounds of the array.

4. **Update the state of `tem`:**
   - The state of `tem` is updated inside the loop as `tem = tem * arr[i]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tem` is `tem * arr[i]`, where `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.
   - For the next iteration, `tem` will be updated to `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]`.

5. **Update the state of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is a list with two elements: `ans[0]` is `tem * arr[-1]` from the previous iteration, and `ans[1]` is `tem`.
   - After the next iteration, `ans[0]` will be updated to `tem * arr[-2]`, and `ans[1]` will be updated to `tem * arr[-1]`.

6. **Construct the new state:**
   - `i` will be `len(arr) - 4`.
   - `tem` will be updated to `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]`.
   - `ans` will be updated to `[tem * arr[-2], tem * arr[-1]]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 4`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `tem * arr[-2]` and the second element is `tem * arr[-1]`**.
