Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the range is defined as `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts at `len(arr) - 3` (as per the given state) and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `-1`. Given that `i` starts at `len(arr) - 3` and decrements by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i - 1`.

3. **Update the state of `i`**: Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 3`, the next value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 4`.

4. **Determine the updated state of `tem`**: The variable `tem` is updated in the loop body as `tem * arr[i]`. Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 3`, the next value of `tem` will be `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]`.

5. **Determine the state of `ans`**: The list `ans` is defined such that its first element is `tem * arr[-1]` from the previous iteration and the second element is `tem`. Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 3`, the next iteration will update `ans` to be `[tem * arr[-2], tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `len(arr) - 4`
- `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]`
- `ans` is `[tem * arr[-2], tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]]`

So, the final state is:

**State: `i` is `len(arr) - 4`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]`, `ans` is `[tem * arr[-2], tem * arr[len(arr) - 4]]`**
