Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is multiplied by the last element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `tem` by `arr[i]`, where `i` is the last index of the list `arr`. After this operation, `i` is decremented by 1, making it `len(arr) - 2`. The value of `tem` is updated to its original value multiplied by the last element of `arr`.
