Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 3`, `tem` is `tem * arr[i]`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `tem * arr[-1]` from the previous iteration and the second element is `tem`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(tem)` appends the current value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element which is `tem * arr[-1]` from the previous iteration. After appending `tem`, `ans` now contains two elements: the first element remains `tem * arr[-1]` and the second element is the current value of `tem`. The values of `i` and `tem` remain unchanged.
