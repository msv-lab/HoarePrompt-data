Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers; `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of positive integers, and `ans` is an empty list.
