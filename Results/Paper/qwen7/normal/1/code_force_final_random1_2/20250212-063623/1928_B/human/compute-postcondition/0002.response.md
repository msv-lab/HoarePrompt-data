Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop also references the variable `arr`, which is used to determine the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - This means `i` should be initialized to the length of `arr` minus one.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `arr` must contain at least one element (i.e., its length must be at least 1).

4. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The variables `ans` and `tem` are not used in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr` must contain at least one element.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**.
