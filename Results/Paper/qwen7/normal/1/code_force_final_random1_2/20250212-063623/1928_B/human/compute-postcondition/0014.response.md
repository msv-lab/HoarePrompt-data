Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements of `arr` from the end to the beginning, where each element in `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` that come after it in the original list.**

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `i` is `-1`.
- `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` when traversed from the last element to the first.
- `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first, with each subsequent element being the product of all preceding elements.

The code `return ans;` simply returns the list `ans`. Since `ans` is already defined as per the initial state, the program returns the list `ans` which contains the cumulative product of elements of `arr` from the end to the beginning, as described.
