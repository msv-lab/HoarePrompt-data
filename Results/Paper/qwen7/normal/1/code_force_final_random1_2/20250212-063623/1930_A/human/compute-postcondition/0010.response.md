Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, and the variable `i` is set to the last index used in the loop, which is `2 * n - 2`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `score` will contain the sum of all elements `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., up to the largest even index less than `2 * n`. The variable `i` will be set to `2 * n - 2`, which is the last index that was accessed in the loop.
