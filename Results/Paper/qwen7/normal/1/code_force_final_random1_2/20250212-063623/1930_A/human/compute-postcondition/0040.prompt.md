Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    score = 0
    for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
        score += l[i]
    print(score)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, until the end of the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `l` remains the same sorted list of integers.

In simpler terms, `score` will be the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest index less than `2 * n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `l`) will retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l` from index 0 to the last even index (up to `2 * n - 2`), `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least the total number of iterations divided by 2 (which is `2 * n / 2 = n`), and `i` is `2 * n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `score` will be the sum of elements at even indices in the list `l` (starting from index 0), up to the last even index. The variable `t` stays the same, `n` must be at least equal to the total number of iterations, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `score` is the original score plus the sum of elements `l[0]`, `l[2]`, ..., `l[2 * n - 2]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 1` because the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, starting from 0 up to but not including `2 * n`. The variable `score` will be the original score (which was 0) plus the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element (`l[0]`) and ending at the element just before the last element (`l[2 * n - 2]`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
