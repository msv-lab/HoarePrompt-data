Output State: **`score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l` from index 0 to the last even index (up to `2 * n - 2`), `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the other variables (`score`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
