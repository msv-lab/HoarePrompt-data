Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `score` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `score` to 0. Since `t`, `n`, and `l` were already defined in the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their values remain unchanged. The new variable `score` is initialized to 0.
