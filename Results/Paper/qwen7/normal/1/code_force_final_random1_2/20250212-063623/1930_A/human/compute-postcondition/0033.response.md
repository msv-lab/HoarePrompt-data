Output State: **`i` is 3; `score` is the original score plus `l[3]`; `n` must be greater than 1.5**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `score` is updated to its original value plus `l[3]`. The conditions for `n` being greater than 1.5 remain unchanged.
