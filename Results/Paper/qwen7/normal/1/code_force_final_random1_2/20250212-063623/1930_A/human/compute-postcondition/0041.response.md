Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on the provided integers and returns the results accordingly.**

Note: The specific operations to be performed on the integers are not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and input format of the test cases.
