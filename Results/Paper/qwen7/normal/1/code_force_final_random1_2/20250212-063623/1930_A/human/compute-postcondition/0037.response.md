Output State: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `score` is the original score plus the sum of elements `l[0]`, `l[2]`, ..., `l[2 * n - 2]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 1` because the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, starting from 0 up to but not including `2 * n`. The variable `score` will be the original score (which was 0) plus the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element (`l[0]`) and ending at the element just before the last element (`l[2 * n - 2]`).
