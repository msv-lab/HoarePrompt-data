Output State: **`score` will be recalculated based on the remaining number of iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `l` remains the same sorted list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`score`, `t`, `l`) remain unchanged and retain their initial states.
