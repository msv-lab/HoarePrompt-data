Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `2 * n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `2 * n` and `i` is incremented by 2 each iteration (`range(0, 2 * n, 2)`).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `i + 2 < 2 * n` (This condition ensures that the next value of `i` will still be within the bounds of the loop).

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - We need to ensure that `i + 2` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i + 2 < 2 * n` is true at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i + 2` is valid for the next iteration.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 2`.
   - `2 * n` remains unchanged.

7. **Final State**:
   - `score` is already adjusted by the loop body.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 2`.
   - `2 * n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `2 * n` remains unchanged**.

Given that `i` is incremented by 2, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 2`.

So, the final state can be written as:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is `i_new`, and `2 * n` remains unchanged**.
