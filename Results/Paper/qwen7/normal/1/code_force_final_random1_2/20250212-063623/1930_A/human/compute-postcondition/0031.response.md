Output State: **`i` is 1, `score` is the original score plus `l[0]`**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 0, `l[i]` refers to `l[0]`. Since `i` is incremented after the operation (assuming it's done in the next line or context), `i` becomes 1. The value of `score` is updated to its original value plus `l[0]`.
