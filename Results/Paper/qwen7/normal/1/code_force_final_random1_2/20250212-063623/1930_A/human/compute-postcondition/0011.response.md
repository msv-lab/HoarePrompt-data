Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, until the end of the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `l` remains the same sorted list of integers.

In simpler terms, `score` will be the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest index less than `2 * n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `l`) will retain their initial values.
