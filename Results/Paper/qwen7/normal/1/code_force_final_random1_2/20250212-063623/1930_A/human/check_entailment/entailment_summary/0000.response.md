Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score according to the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads \(2n\) integers and sorts them. Sorting ensures that when we pick pairs of elements (starting from the smallest), we are always picking the minimum of the pair, which helps in maximizing the score.
3. **Calculating Score**: After sorting, the program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices. This effectively pairs the smallest elements together, ensuring that the score is maximized because \(\min(x, y)\) is always the smaller of the two elements in the pair.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, this approach guarantees that the score is maximized by always pairing the smallest available elements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
