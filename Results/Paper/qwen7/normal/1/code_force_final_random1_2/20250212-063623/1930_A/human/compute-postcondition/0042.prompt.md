You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, and going up to the second-to-last element. Specifically, `score` will be the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `2 * n - 2`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `l` remains the same sorted list of integers. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 1` after the loop completes.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `score` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are at even indices (starting from index 0). The variable `t` stays the same, `n` remains unchanged, and `l` retains its sorted form. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 1` because it increments by 2 in each iteration, starting from 0 up to but not including `2 * n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on the provided integers and returns the results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
