Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `score` is the original score plus `l[3]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs when `i` is in the range from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches or exceeds `2 * n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given `i` is now 5, `2 * n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is now 5.
   - `score` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.5, but since the loop condition is based on `i` and `2 * n`, `n` itself does not change in this context.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 5, `score` is the original score plus `l[3]`, `n` must be greater than 1.5**
