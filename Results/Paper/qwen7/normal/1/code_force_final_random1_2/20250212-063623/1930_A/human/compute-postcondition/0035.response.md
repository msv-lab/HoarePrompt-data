Output State: **`i` is 5; `score` is the original score plus `l[5]`**.

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 5, `score` is updated to be its original value plus `l[5]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1.5 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` remains 5.
