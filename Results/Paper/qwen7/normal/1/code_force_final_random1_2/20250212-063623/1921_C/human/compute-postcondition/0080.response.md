Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If the difference is greater than or equal to `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.
