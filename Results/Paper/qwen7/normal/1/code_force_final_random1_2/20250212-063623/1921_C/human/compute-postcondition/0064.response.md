Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `f` is equal to `feat[1]`, `a` is equal to `feat[2]`, `n` and `feat` remain the same, and `array2` remains the same as it is constructed inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `feat[2]` to the variable `a`. All other variables (`feat`, `n`, `i`, `f`, and `array2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
