Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list with one additional element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) to `array2`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the line `i += 1`, `i` becomes 2. Therefore, the expression evaluated is \((arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
