Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Stepan can send all the messages. Specifically, the program does not account for the charge consumption when turning the phone off and on at the exact moment a message needs to be sent. This oversight can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
- `t = 1`
- `n = 2`, `f = 10`, `a = 1`, `b = 5`
- `arr = [1, 11]`

According to the problem description, the phone starts with 10 units of charge. It loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time it is on. To send a message at moment 1, it would lose 1 unit of charge. If Stepan turns off the phone at moment 1 and turns it back on at moment 11, he would spend 5 units of charge (since turning off and on consumes 5 units). However, the program does not account for the fact that the phone would have 8 units of charge left after turning it off and on, which is enough to send the second message at moment 11.

The program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case because it does not properly handle the charge consumption when turning the phone off and on at the exact moment a message needs to be sent. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
