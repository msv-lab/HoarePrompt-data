Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `i` should be `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `n` and `feat` remain the same, and `array2` remains the same as it is constructed inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `feat`. The value of `i` is updated based on the first element of `feat`, `n`, and the condition that `i` should be less than `test_cases`. The values of `n` and `feat` remain unchanged, and `array2` remains unchanged as it is constructed inside the loop.
