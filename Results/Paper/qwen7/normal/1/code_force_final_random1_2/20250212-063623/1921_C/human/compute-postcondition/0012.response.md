Output State: **`i` is 2, `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, `n` must be greater than 1, the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) to the list `array2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so now `i` becomes 2. The value \((arr[1] - arr[0]) * a\) is appended to `array2`. The conditions about `n` and the difference being less than `b / a` remain unchanged.
