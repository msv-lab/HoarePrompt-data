Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters `1` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `0`.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `feat`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is in the range `[1, n)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `0`, it needs to be incremented to `1` for the loop to start executing.
   - `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute at least once (since `i` starts at `0` and the loop runs until `i < n`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `1`.
- `n` must be greater than `1`.

The other variables (`feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
