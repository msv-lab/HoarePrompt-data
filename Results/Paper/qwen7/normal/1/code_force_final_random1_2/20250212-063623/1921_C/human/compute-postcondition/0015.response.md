Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `array2` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`.
   - The loop variable `n` is not modified within the loop; it remains constant.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 3 (since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1).

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `array2` remains unchanged unless the condition in the postcondition is met. However, since the condition is not specified to change `array2` based on the current state, `array2` remains the same.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `array2` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `array2` remains unchanged**.
