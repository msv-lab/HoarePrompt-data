Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) to `array2`. Given the initial state, `i` was 1, so now `i` is incremented to 2. The condition for appending the value to `array2` is met since the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. The value appended to `array2` is \((arr[1] - arr[0]) * a\). All other variables remain unchanged.
