Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 2`, `n` is greater than `feat[0] + 2`, `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `array2`. The new element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, where `i` is `feat[0] + 2`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than `feat[0] + 2` still holds.
