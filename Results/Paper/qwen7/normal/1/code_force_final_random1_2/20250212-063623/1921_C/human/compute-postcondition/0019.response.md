Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is an integer starting from 3.
   - `array2` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body (Omitted):**
   - If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then:
     - `i` becomes 4.
     - `array2` is updated to `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]`.
   - Otherwise, `i` and `array2` remain unchanged.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts from 3, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` could either be 3 or 4 depending on the condition.

5. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 4 if the condition is met.
   - If `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain 4 unless the condition is met again, but since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `i` cannot be 4 as it would exceed the range.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be 4 if the condition is met.
   - `array2` will be updated to `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]` if the condition is met.
   - `array2` will remain unchanged if the condition is not met.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `array2` will be `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]` if the condition is met; otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `array2` is [arr[3] - arr[2] * a] if the condition is met, otherwise unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than 1**.

However, since we need to provide a single state without specifying the condition explicitly, we can summarize it as follows:

State: **`i` is 4, `array2` is [arr[3] - arr[2] * a] if the condition is met, otherwise unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than 1**.
