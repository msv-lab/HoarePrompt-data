Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `power` is increased by 1.**

The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Since the initial state only specifies that `n` must be greater than 1 and does not mention `power`, the only change is to the `power` variable, which is now one more than its previous value.
