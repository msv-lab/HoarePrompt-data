Output State: `power` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Given that `power` increases by 1 each iteration and starts at 1, after 4 iterations, `power` will be 5. For the loop to execute 4 times, `n` must be greater than 4. All other conditions (such as `n_cases` being greater than 0 and `i` remaining 2) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
