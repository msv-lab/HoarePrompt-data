Output State: **`power` is 1, `n` is log2(n), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `n = log2(n)` changes the value of `n` to the base-2 logarithm of its original value. The other variables (`power`, `n_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `power` is still 1, `n` is now log2(n) (where n was originally an input integer), `n_cases` must still be greater than 0, and `n` is no longer equal to 1 since it has been modified.
