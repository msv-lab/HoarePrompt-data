The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 1, let's consider the possible values:

- If `n` is exactly 2, then `power` (which is 2) cannot be less than `n`.
- If `n` is greater than 2, then `power` (which is 2) can be less than `n`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
