Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` and `n_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `t` being an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `n_cases` being greater than 0.
