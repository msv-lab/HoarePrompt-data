Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `power` is explicitly given as 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 4, but its exact value is not needed to solve this problem.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to solve this problem.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `power` equals `n`, so `n` is also 5.

2. The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

3. Given that `power` is 5, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** 5`.

4. Calculating `2 ** 5` gives us 32.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be 32.

Output: **32**
