Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer (its value is not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `power` is either equal to `n` or is set to 5 if `n` is greater than 4.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n_cases`. Given that `i` is currently 2, `n_cases` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n_cases` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `power` is either equal to `n` or is set to 5 if `n` is greater than 4**.
