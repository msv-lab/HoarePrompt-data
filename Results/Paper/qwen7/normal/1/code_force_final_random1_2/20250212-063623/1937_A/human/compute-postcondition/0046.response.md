Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `power` is either equal to `n` or is set to 5 if `n` is greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables are preserved, except for `n` which now holds the value of the input integer.
