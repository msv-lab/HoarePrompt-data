Output State: **`power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The conditions for `n` and `n_cases` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` remains 2 as it was not affected by the code.
