Given the initial state where `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `power` is equal to `n-1`, the expression `2 ** power` calculates 2 raised to the power of `n-1`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, `power` will be at least 0 (when `n` is 2). Therefore, `2 ** power` will be `2 ** (n-1)`.

Output: **2 ** (n-1)**
