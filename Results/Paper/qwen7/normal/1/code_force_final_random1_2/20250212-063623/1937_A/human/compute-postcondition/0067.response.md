Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers t and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It does not return anything explicitly but implies processing or performing some operation based on these integers within its body.**

Given the constraints, the function likely handles multiple test cases (t times) where for each case, it processes an integer n. However, since the exact operation is not specified, the focus here is on the parameters and their constraints rather than the internal logic.
