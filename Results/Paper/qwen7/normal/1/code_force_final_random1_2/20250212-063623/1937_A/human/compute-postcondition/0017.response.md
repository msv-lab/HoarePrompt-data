Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 5.
- `n` is greater than 256 but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0 but its value is not needed for the print statement either.

The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`. Given that `power` is 5, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to `2 ** 5`, which is 32.

Output: **32**
