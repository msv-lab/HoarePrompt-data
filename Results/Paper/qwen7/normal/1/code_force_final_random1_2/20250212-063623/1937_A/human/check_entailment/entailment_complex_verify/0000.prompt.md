You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())

            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n_cases`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n_cases-1`, the value of `power` is determined as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it calculates a specific power of 2 and prints the result. If \( n \) is 1, it directly prints 1. Otherwise, it computes the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to \( n \), and prints the value of that power. The function reads the number of test cases first, then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and performs the calculation and printing as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `swap` operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to find the largest divisor of `k` using a logarithmic approach, which is not relevant to the actual `swap` operation. Instead, it calculates powers of 2, which has no connection to the swapping of elements in the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should find the largest divisor of `k` (denoted as `d`) and then swap `a[d]` and `a[k]`. However, the current implementation does not perform any swaps and instead tries to guess the final position of `1` based on the size of `n`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input `n = 6`. The correct sequence of swaps would be:
- `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- `swap(3)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change since 3 is a prime and has no valid swap)
- `swap(4)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change since 4 is not a prime and its largest proper divisor is 2, but the swap was already done)
- `swap(5)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change since 5 is a prime and has no valid swap)
- `swap(6)`: `[6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`

After these operations, the position of `1` is `2`, not `67108864` as the program incorrectly outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
