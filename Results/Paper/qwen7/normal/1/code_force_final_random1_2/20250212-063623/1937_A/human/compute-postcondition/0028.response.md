Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `power` is 1
   - `n` is `log2(n)` (which means `n` is the base-2 logarithm of some number)
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for it)
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for it)

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `power` is 1.
   - To satisfy the condition `power < n`, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`power` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
