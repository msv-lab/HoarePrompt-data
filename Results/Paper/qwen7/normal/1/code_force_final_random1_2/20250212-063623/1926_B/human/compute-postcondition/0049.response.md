Postcondition: `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's from all input strings `b`, `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `a` remains the same, and each input string `b` is greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, the postcondition remains as described. If `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`, the postcondition also remains as described.
