You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `a`, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's from all input strings provided across all iterations, and `b` is the last input string received. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds as is. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the condition also holds as is.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a grid consisting of n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. The function identifies whether the shape is a triangle or a square and returns which shape it is.

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
