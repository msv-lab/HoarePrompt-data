Output State: **`k` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same**.

The code `k = []` initializes `k` as an empty list. Since `k` was previously defined as remaining the same, it is now an empty list. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state. The value of `a` remains unchanged.
