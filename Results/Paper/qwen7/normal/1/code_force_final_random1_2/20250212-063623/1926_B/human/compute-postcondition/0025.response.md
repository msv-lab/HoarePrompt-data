Postcondition: `k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'. If an input string `b` did not contain '1', it is not included in the list `k`. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, the condition holds as is. If `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`, the condition also holds as is.
