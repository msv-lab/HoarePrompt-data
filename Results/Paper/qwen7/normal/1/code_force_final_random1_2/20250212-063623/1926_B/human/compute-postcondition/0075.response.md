Postcondition: `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's from all input strings provided, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `b` is the last input string received. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds as is. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the condition also holds as is.
