Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range.
   - `int(input())`: This is the value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `k` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. If `int(input())` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop condition depends on the input from the user, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer. Additionally, the loop head itself does not directly involve `k`, but since `k` is mentioned in the problem, we should ensure that `k` remains an empty list until the loop starts modifying it.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the input must be a positive integer.

**State:**
- `k` is an empty list
- The input must be a positive integer

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`k` is an empty list, the input must be a positive integer**
