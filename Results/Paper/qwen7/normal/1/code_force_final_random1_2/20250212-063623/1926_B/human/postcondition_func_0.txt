The function processes multiple grids, each defined by a series of lines containing '0' and '1'. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's in each line and determines whether these '1's form a square or a triangle. It then prints 'SQUARE' if the shape is a square, and 'TRIANGLE' if the shape is a triangle. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each grid processed.
