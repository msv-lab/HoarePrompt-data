Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k + 2`
- `t` is the same as before (though `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this specific print statement)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
