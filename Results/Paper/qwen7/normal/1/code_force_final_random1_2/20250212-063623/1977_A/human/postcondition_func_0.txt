The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( m \) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on these conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results of the last test case. The variables \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \) retain their values from the last test case.
