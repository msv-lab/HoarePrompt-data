Postcondition: `i` is `k + 2`, `t` is the same as before, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` equals `m`, no changes are made. If `m` is greater than `n`, no changes are made. If `m` equals `n - 1`, no changes are made. If `m` and `n` are both even, `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.
