Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Case `m == n - 1`:** This case should be handled correctly, but the current logic only checks for this condition once and does not account for other scenarios where `m` could be `n-1`.

2. **General Case Handling:** The program should consider that adding and removing cubes in any combination can result in `m` cubes after `n` moves. If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes. However, the current logic incorrectly allows some of these combinations.

To fix this, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which would indicate that the parity remains consistent through the operations. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary and sufficient for the operations to be possible.
