Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `n` is equal to `m`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is even or `n` is even.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will always output the string `'No'`, regardless of the specific values of `n` and `m` as long as they meet the specified conditions.

Output: **'No'**
