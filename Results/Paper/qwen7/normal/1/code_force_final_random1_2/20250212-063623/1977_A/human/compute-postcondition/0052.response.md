Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `m` is an integer from the input.
   - `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` is the same as before.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `k + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` should be updated to `k + 2` and `t` remains the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `m` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to `k + 2`.
   - `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `i` is k + 2, `t` is the same as before**.
