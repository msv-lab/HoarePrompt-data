Output: **Yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide specific values for `k`, `t`, `n`, or `m`.
- The only information given is that `i` is defined as `k + 2`.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any of the other variables (`k`, `t`, `n`, `m`), the output is simply `'Yes'`.
