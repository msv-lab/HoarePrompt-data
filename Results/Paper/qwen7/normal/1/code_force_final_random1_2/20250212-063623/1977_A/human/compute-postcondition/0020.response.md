Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user and is equal to `m`.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user and is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Both `m` and `n` are even numbers.

The code snippet only contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
