Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` is equal to `m`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. If both `m` and `n` are even, then they remain even; otherwise, at least one of `m` or `n` is even.
