You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, since the loop runs `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` is the first integer input by the user, and `m` is the second integer input by the user during the last iteration. The output of the loop depends on the values of `n` and `m` during the last iteration:
    #
    #- If `n` equals `m`, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If `m` is greater than `n`, the output is 'No'.
    #- If `m` equals `n - 1`, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If both `m` and `n` are even, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If both `m` and `n` are odd, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- Otherwise, the output is 'No'.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, and the final output of the loop is determined by the values of `n` and `m` from the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times.
     - Output: `Yes` (Correct)
   - **Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - Nikita can only end up with either 0 or 2 cubes.
     - Output: `No` (Correct)
   - **Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times and remove 1 cube once.
     - Output: `Yes` (Correct)

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - The logic checks several conditions to determine if `m` cubes can be obtained after `n` moves:
     - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
     - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
     - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
     - If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
     - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - `n == m`: This condition correctly handles the case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes.
   - `m > n`: This condition correctly handles the case where the desired number of cubes exceeds the number of moves.
   - `m == n - 1`: This condition correctly handles the case where the desired number of cubes is one less than the number of moves.
   - Both `m` and `n` being even or both being odd: This condition is unnecessary because the parity (even/odd nature) of `m` and `n` does not affect the possibility of obtaining `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key is whether `m` can be achieved within `n` moves.

4. **Simplified Logic**:
   - The program can be simplified by removing the conditions related to the parity of `m` and `n`. The correct conditions are:
     - `n == m`
     - `m > n`
     - `m == n - 1`

### Conclusion:
The given program is almost correct but can be simplified. However, based on the current logic, it still produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
