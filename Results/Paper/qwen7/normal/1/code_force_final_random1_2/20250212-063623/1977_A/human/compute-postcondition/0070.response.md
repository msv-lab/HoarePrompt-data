Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The variables `n` and `m` remain the values entered during the first iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1` since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. No further changes are made to `n` and `m` throughout the loop's iterations based on the given conditions.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The value of `t` stays unchanged and is an integer between 1 and 100. `n` and `m` retain their values from the first input pair. The loop variable `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
