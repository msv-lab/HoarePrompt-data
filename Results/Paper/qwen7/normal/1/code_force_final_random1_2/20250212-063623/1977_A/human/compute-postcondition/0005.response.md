Output: **Yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- It is also given that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `m`.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string "Yes" to the console. Since no values of `n` or `m` are required to determine the output of this print statement, the output is simply the string "Yes".
