Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and no other variables are affected.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be an integer within the specified range (1 to 100), while `n` and `m` remain undefined from the initial state.
