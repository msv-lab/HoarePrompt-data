Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes values for t, n, and m where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. The function returns different outputs based on the values of n and m for each test case.**

However, since the specific output logic based on n and m is not provided, the exact return values cannot be detailed. The function seems to handle multiple test cases defined by t, processing each pair of n and m within the given constraints.
