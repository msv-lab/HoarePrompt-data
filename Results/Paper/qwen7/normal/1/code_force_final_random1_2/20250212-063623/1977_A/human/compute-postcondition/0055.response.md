Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k + 2`
- `t` is the same as before (though `t` was not defined in the initial state, it is not used in the print statement)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
