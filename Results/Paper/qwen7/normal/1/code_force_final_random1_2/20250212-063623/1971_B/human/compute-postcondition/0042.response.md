Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the input string `s`, `b` is a sorted string of the input string `s`, and `c` is the string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order. The postcondition remains the same regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.**
