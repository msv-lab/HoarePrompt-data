Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the updated `s`, `b` is a sorted string of the updated `s`, `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply the combination of the preconditions and the fact that the program fragment does not change these variables.
