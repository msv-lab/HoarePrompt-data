Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` is true.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this, the output will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
