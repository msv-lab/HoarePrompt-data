Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `a` and `b` are updated to new integers from the input.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
