Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `p` is a list containing the single element 0, `c` is a list containing the single element 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the first element of the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the new first element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` appended, `c` is a list containing the value of `j` and the updated value of `j` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is the second element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `i` appended, `c` is a list containing the updated value of `j` and the new value of `j` appended, `c` now has an additional element which is the new value of `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
