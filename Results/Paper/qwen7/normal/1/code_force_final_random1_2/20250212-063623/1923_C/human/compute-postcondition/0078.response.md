Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The values of `l`, `x`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is updated based on whether `x` is 1 or not, but since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep the condition as is.
