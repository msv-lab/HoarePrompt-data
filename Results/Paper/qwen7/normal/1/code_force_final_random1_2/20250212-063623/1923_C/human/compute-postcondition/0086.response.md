Output State: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `p` is a list of cumulative sums of integers in `l`, starting with 0; `c` is a list of counts of 1s up to each index in `l`, starting with 0.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be the total sum of all integers in the list `l`. The variable `j` will hold the total count of 1s in `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the integers in `l`, where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, starting with 0. The list `c` will contain the cumulative counts of 1s up to each index in `l`, also starting with 0.
