Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we can only describe `a` and `b` in terms of the input numbers they represent. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined.
