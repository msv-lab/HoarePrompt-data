Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is updated to be the second integer entered through input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `n` is the first integer entered through input, `l` is a list of integers split from the input, `p` is now `[0]`, `c` is now `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is increased by `x`, and if the value of `x` is 1, then the variable `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j + 1` and `c` has appended `j + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
