Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value 2, `c` is a list containing the value 1**.

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `l`, the value of `i` is updated by adding `x` to its current value. The values of `j`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged as per the condition given.
