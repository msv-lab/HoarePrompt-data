Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of integers in `l`, `c` is a list of counts of 1s encountered up to each index in `l`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will hold the sum of all integers in the list `l`. The variable `j` will hold the total count of 1s in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the integers in `l`, where each element `p[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` integers in `l`. The list `c` will contain the cumulative counts of 1s encountered so far, where each element `c[k]` represents the count of 1s in the sublist `l[0:k+1]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` is true, then the condition holds. Otherwise, the difference `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`, and `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 0. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 1. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made to `i` and `s`. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `i` and `s` as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
