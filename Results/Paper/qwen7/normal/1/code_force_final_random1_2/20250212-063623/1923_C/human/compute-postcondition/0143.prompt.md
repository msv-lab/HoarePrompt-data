Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers representing the last pair of numbers entered through input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed minus 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `p` is now `[0], c` is now `[0]`
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed minus 1, `l` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `p` is now `[0, 1]`, `c` is now `[0, 1]`, and `x` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the value 2, `c` is a list containing the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the values [2, `i`], `c` is a list containing the values [1, `j`].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
