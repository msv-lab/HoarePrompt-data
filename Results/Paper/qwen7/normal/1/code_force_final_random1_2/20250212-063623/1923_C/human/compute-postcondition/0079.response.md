Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `x` is the next integer in the list `l`.
   - `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is increased by `x`.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `i`.
   - `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the next integer in the list.
   - `j` is updated based on the value of `x`.
   - `i` is updated by adding `x` to its current value.
   - `p` contains the current value of `i`.
   - `c` contains the current value of `j`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the next integer in the list `l`, for the loop to continue, `l` must still contain at least one element.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `l`.
   - `j` will be updated based on the value of `x` (either incremented by 1 if `x == 1` or unchanged).
   - `i` will be updated by adding `x` to its current value.
   - `p` will contain the new value of `i`.
   - `c` will contain the new value of `j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `i` and `j`, and ensure that `l` still has at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is updated based on the value of `x`, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`**.

To be more specific, if we denote the current value of `i` as `i_current` and `j` as `j_current`, then:
- `i` becomes `i_current + x`.
- `j` becomes `j_current + 1` if `x == 1`, otherwise `j` remains `j_current`.

However, since the exact values of `i_current` and `j_current` are not provided, the general form of the answer is as stated above.
