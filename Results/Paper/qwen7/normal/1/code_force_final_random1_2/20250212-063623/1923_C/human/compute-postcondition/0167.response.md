Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `s - (b - a + 1)` is non-negative is still valid, but since no changes were made to `s`, `b`, or `a` in the code, we do not need to explicitly mention this condition in the output state.
