Output State: **`m` is equal to the total number of iterations plus 1, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `n` is the first integer entered through input, and `m` is updated to be the second integer entered through input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous states. `m` is updated to the value of the second integer entered through input, and `n` is updated to the value of the first integer entered through input.
