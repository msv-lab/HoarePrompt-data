Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(m):` statement. The only variable directly controlled by this loop is `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `m` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `m` must be greater than 0.

4. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 0. Since no changes are mentioned to be made to `m` within the loop body based on the given conditions, `m` will remain greater than 0 if it was greater than 0 at the start of the current iteration.

5. **Adjusting the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`, which must remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**
