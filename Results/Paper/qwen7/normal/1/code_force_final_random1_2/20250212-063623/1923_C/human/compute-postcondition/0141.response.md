Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the values [2, `i`], `c` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `p` initially contains the value 2, after appending `i`, `p` will contain `[2, i]`. The other variables (`x`, `j`, `i`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
