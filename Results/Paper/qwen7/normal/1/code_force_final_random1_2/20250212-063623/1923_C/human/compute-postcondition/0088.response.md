Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m)`. The only variables involved here are `m` (the number of iterations) and `_` (a dummy variable used for iteration).

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. The dummy variable `_` is incremented in each iteration but does not affect the initial state.

3. **Adjust the given states**: We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 so that the loop can execute. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `c`) are not directly affected by the loop head and their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`m` must be greater than 0**
