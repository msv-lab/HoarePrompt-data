Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` is true, then no changes are made to `m`. Otherwise, `m` remains greater than 0.
