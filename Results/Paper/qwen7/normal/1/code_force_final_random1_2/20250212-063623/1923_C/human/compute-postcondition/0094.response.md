Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an integer equal to the first input number.
- `b` is an integer equal to the second input number.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` is true.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given that the condition is true and no other variables need to be evaluated further for this specific print statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
