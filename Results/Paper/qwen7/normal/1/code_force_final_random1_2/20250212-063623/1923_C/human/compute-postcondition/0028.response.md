Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is the second element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `i` appended, `c` is a list containing the updated value of `j` and the new value of `j` appended, `c` now has an additional element which is the new value of `j`.**

This means that the list `c` has had its last element updated to the new value of `j`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
