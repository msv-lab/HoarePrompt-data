Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, and `coef` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `visited` list to a list of `False` values of the same length as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
