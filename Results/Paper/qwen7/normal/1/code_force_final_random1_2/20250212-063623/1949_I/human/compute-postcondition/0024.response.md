Postcondition: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is False.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. If the condition `not visited[i]` is true, then `i` is set to 1, and `ok` is determined based on the value of `tot`. If there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes made in the if part.
