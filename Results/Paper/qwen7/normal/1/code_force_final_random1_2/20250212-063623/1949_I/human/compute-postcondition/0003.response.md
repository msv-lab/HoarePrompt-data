Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `visited` retains its original value, and `coef` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code initializes `r` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. The lengths and contents of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `visited` and `coef` retain their original values.
