Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `bipartite` is `True`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- Each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user.
- The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have a length of `n`.
- `visited` is a list of `False` values, with the same length as `x`, `y`, and `r`.
- `coef[i-1]` (which is `coef[n-1]`) is `1`.
- `tot` is `0`.
- `ok` is `True`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without any variables or conditions affecting it.

Output: **YES**
