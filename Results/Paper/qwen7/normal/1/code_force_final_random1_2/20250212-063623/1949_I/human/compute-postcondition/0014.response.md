Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, while all other variables (`visited` and `coef`) remain unchanged and are still filled with `False` and `None`, respectively; `tot` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. Since the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` were previously populated with integers and the variable `i` was set to `n`, these states remain unchanged. The `visited` and `coef` lists also remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `tot` is now 0.
