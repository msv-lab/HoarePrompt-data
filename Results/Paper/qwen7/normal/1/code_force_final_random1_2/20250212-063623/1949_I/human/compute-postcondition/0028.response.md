Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `coef[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `tot` is 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `ok` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `bipartite` has been set to `True`, while all other variables (`coef[2]`, `i`, `tot`, `n`, `bipartite`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `ok`) retain their original values from the initial state.
