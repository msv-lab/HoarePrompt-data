`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the radii of the disks respectively, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of integers of length `n` initialized to `1`.
