Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef` remains unchanged and is still filled with `None`; `tot` is 0, `ok` is False.**

The variable `ok` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state.
