Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `bipartite` is `True`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers up to index `n-1` (entered by the user).
- `x`, `y`, and `r` have a length of `n`.
- `visited` is a list filled with `False`.
- `coef[i-1]` (which is `coef[n-1]`) is `1`.
- `tot` is `0`.
- `ok` is `False` because `bipartite` is `True` but `tot` is `0`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Output: **NO**
