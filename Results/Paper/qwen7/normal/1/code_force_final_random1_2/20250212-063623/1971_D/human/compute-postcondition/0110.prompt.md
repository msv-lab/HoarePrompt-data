Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 2, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met minus 1 throughout the entire loop execution, `flag` is True if at any point in the loop execution `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, and `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes all its iterations, `j` is equal to the length of the string `s`, `count` reflects the number of transitions between different characters in `s`, and `flag` is True if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string, otherwise it remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `count` is the total number of transitions from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' in the string `s` minus one, `flag` is True if there was at least one transition from '0' to '1' during the loop's execution, otherwise `flag` is False, and `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
