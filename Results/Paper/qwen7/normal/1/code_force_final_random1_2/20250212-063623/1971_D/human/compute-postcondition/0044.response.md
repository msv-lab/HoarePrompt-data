Output State: **`s` is a string, the current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1` in `s`; `count` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The condition that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1` in `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `count` and retains the original condition involving `j` and `s`.
