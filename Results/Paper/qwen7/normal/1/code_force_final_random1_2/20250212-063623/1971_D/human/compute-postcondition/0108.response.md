Postcondition: **`j` is equal to the length of `s`, `count` is the total number of transitions from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' in the string `s` minus one, `flag` is True if there was at least one transition from '0' to '1' during the loop's execution, otherwise `flag` is False, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
