### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \). If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
     - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
     - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
     - If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(n^2 / 2\).
     - If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
     - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
     - It iteratively modifies the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current permutation.
     - If `k` is less than the current index, it calls `func_2()` to swap elements.
     - Otherwise, it updates `k` and calls `func_3()` to swap elements.
   - **func_2()**: This function swaps two elements in the list.
   - **func_3()**: This function swaps two elements in the list.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_4()`, `func_1()`, and `func_5()`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - If \( k \) is odd, the function correctly returns "No" because the Manhattan value must be even.
     - If \( k \) is even and within the maximum possible range, the function constructs a valid permutation.
   - **Constructing Permutations**:
     - The function uses a greedy approach to construct permutations by swapping elements to minimize the Manhattan value.
     - The logic in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly to match the required Manhattan value.
   - **Swapping Elements**:
     - Both `func_2()` and `func_3()` swap elements in the list, but `func_3()` always returns the same list, which is incorrect since it should modify the list in place.

4. **Testing**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the outputs match the expected results, but this does not guarantee the correctness of the entire algorithm.

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_3()` does not actually modify the list `l` in place; instead, it returns the same list without changes. This means that the modifications made in `func_1()` do not persist, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The code incorrectly implements the logic to construct permutations because `func_3()` does not modify the list in place. This leads to incorrect results when constructing the permutation.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
