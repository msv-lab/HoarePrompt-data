Postcondition: `i` is `i - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i - 2`, `c` is increased by 1, and if `k` equals 0, the function returns `i` which is `i - 2`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the function either returns `i - 2` (if `k` equals 0) or calls `func_2(c, k, l)` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l`.
