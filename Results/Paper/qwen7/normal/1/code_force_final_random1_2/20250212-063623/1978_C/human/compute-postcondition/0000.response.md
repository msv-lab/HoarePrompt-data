Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12 after the function `func_4()` has been called and returned new values for `n` and `k`.**

The code `n, k = func_4()` calls the function `func_4()`, which returns two values, `n` and `k`. Since the exact behavior of `func_4()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after the call. However, we know that `n` will still be an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `k` will still be an integer within the range 0 to 10^12. Therefore, the output state reflects these constraints post-function execution.
