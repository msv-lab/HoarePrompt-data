You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1. At that point, the loop will terminate. Since `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 2 each iteration, eventually `i` will reach -1 or less. The final value of `c` will be `n // 2`, as `i` decreases by 2 each time and the loop runs `n // 2` times. `k` will be adjusted in each iteration according to the rule `k = k - i + 1`, and `l` will be updated to the return value of `func_3(c, l)` after each adjustment of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12. The function may return an undefined value, call `func_2` with specific arguments, call `func_3` with specific arguments, return the value of `l`, return `i - 2`, or call `func_2` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l` based on certain conditions involving `c`, `i`, and `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a value for `l`, but since `l` is not defined or affected by any operation in the given code snippet, the return value is undefined.

Case_2: The program returns the result of calling function `func_2` with arguments `c + 1`, `k`, and `l`, where `c` is increased by 1 and `k` is not equal to 0 and is less than `i - 1`.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, and `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

Case_4: The program returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, and `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

Case_5: The program returns i which is i - 2

Case_6: The program returns the value of `i - 2` if `k` equals 0, otherwise, it calls the function `func_2(c, k, l)` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
