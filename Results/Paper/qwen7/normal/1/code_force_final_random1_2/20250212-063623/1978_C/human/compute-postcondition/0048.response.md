Output State: The list `l` is reversed, `k` is `0`, and `i` is `-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will be fully reversed because each iteration moves the last element of the current list to the front or removes the last element until the list is empty. Since the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`, it effectively reverses the list. Additionally, once the loop condition `i >= 0` is no longer met (i.e., `i` becomes `-1`), the loop terminates, and since `k` was decremented to `0` during the last iteration where `1 + i <= k` held true, `k` remains `0`.
