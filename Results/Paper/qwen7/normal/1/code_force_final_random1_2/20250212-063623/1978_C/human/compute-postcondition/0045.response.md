Output State: **`l` is a list without its last element; `x` is the last element of the modified list `l`; `k` is `k - i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. After this operation, `x`, which was previously the last element of `l`, is now the second-to-last element of the modified list `l`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
