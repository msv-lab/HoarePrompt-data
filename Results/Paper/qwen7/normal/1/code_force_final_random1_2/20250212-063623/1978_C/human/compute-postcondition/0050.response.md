Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive. Based on the value of `k`, the function returns a modified list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` as initially constructed. If `k` is greater than 0, the function reverses the list `l` and inserts the last element at a specific index determined by `k`. The final state of the list `l` depends on the value of `k` and the number of iterations through the loop.**
