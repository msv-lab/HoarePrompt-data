Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are some issues and a corrected approach:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not handling the logic for constructing permutations correctly. It seems to be trying to swap elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value, but the implementation is flawed.
2. **Function `func_4`**: This function incorrectly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value. It should consider the maximum possible value considering the constraints.
3. **Function `func_5` and `func_6`**: These functions handle printing the results but do not correctly call the necessary functions to construct the permutation.

### Corrected Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand how to construct permutations that meet the required Manhattan value. Hereâ€™s a more detailed and correct approach:

1. **Constructing Permutations**: We can use a strategy where we place numbers in positions to maximize or minimize the Manhattan distance as needed.
2. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases like when `n` is odd and `k` is even, or vice versa.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def find_permutation(n, k):
    if k > n * (n - 1) // 2:
        return None
    perm = list(range(1, n + 1))
    i = 0
    while k > 0:
        if k >= 2 * (n - 1 - i):
            perm[i], perm[n - 1 - i] = perm[n - 1 - i], perm[i]
            k -= 2 * (n - 1 - i)
        else:
            perm[i], perm[i + k] = perm[i + k], perm[i]
            k = 0
        i += 1
    return perm

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = find_permutation(n, k)
        if result is None:
            results.append("No")
        else:
            results.append("Yes")
            print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
    
    return "\n".join(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(solve())
```

This solution constructs the permutation by swapping elements strategically to achieve the desired Manhattan value. It handles both even and odd `n` and ensures the permutation is valid.
