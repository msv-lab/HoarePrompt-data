### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - **`func_4()`**: Checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns \( (0, 0) \). Otherwise, it returns \( (n, k) \).
   - **`func_1()`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It uses a loop to iteratively adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \( k \).
   - **`func_2()`**: Swaps two elements in the permutation list based on the values of \( c \) and \( k \).
   - **`func_3()`**: Swaps two elements in the permutation list, but due to the nature of the swap, the list remains unchanged.
   - **`func_5()`**: Prints the permutation if it exists and returns.
   - **`func_6()`**: Orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` to get \( n \) and \( k \), then constructs the permutation using `func_1()`, and finally prints the result using `func_5()`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - `func_3()` is redundant because it doesn't change the list.
   - `func_2()` is used to swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - `func_1()` constructs the permutation by iteratively adjusting the list based on the remaining value of \( k \).

4. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_4()` correctly identifies if a solution is possible based on the parity of \( k \) and the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - `func_1()` iteratively constructs the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - `func_5()` correctly prints the permutation if it exists.

Given the provided execution summaries and the logical flow of the functions, the overall approach seems to correctly implement the required functionality.

The given program is designed to solve the problem correctly according to the provided specifications and execution summaries.
