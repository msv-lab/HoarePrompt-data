Output State: **The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1. At that point, the loop will terminate. Since `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 2 each iteration, eventually `i` will reach -1 or less. The final value of `c` will be `n // 2`, as `i` decreases by 2 each time and the loop runs `n // 2` times. `k` will be adjusted in each iteration according to the rule `k = k - i + 1`, and `l` will be updated to the return value of `func_3(c, l)` after each adjustment of `k`.**

This means that after all iterations, `c` will be `n // 2`, `k` will be the result of repeatedly applying the adjustment rule until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1, and `l` will be the final value returned by `func_3(c, l)` after the last adjustment of `k`.
