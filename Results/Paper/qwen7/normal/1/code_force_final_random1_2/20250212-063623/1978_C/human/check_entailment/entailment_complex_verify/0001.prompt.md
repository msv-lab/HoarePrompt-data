You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1. At that point, the loop will terminate. Since `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 2 each iteration, eventually `i` will reach -1 or less. The final value of `c` will be `n // 2`, as `i` decreases by 2 each time and the loop runs `n // 2` times. `k` will be adjusted in each iteration according to the rule `k = k - i + 1`, and `l` will be updated to the return value of `func_3(c, l)` after each adjustment of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12. It may return an undefined value, call `func_2` with specific arguments, call `func_3` with specific arguments, return the value of `l`, return `i - 2`, or call `func_2` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l` based on certain conditions involving `c`, `i`, and `k`. The function iteratively updates `k` and `l` by calling `func_3` and adjusts `i` by decrementing it by 2 in each iteration. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= c < len(l), k is an integer such that 0 <= k < len(l), and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.

    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` with the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer), `k` (an integer), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation). After executing, it returns the list `l` with the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped.

#Function 3:

    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `c` and a list `l` of integers. It swaps the elements at positions `c-1` and `len(l)-c` in the list `l`, then returns the modified list. However, due to the swap operation, the returned list is identical to the input list `l`.

#Function 4:

    #The program returns n and k, where n is an integer obtained from the first input split, and k is an integer obtained from the second input split and is divisible by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is divisible by 2. If \( k \) is not divisible by 2, it returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is divisible by 2, it calculates \( max_k \) based on whether \( n \) is odd or even. If \( max_k \) is less than \( k \), it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}) that has been determined to have a Manhattan value equal to k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}). Each integer in the list is a valid permutation and is distinct.

        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have printed all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop iterates over each element in the list `l` and prints them one by one using `print(i, end=' ')`, after all iterations of the loop have finished, it means every integer (permutation) in the list `l` has been printed exactly once, with no newline character (`\n`) added between them due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function. Therefore, the output will be a single line containing all the elements of `l` in the order they were originally listed, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, where each integer represents a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) with a Manhattan value equal to k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It prints each permutation on the same line, separated by spaces, and then returns nothing.

    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the new values of `n` and `k` after calling `func_4()`, or the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))` based on whether `n` is zero. If `n` is zero, the function prints 'NO' and returns immediately. Otherwise, it calculates `l` using `func_1(n, k)`, calls `func_5(l)`, and then returns the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \). If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
     - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
     - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
     - If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(n^2 / 2\).
     - If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
     - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
     - It iteratively modifies the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current permutation.
     - If `k` is less than the current index, it calls `func_2()` to swap elements.
     - Otherwise, it updates `k` and calls `func_3()` to swap elements.
   - **func_2()**: This function swaps two elements in the list.
   - **func_3()**: This function swaps two elements in the list.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_4()`, `func_1()`, and `func_5()`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Edge Cases**: 
     - If \( k \) is odd, the function correctly returns "No" because the Manhattan value must be even.
     - If \( k \) is even and within the maximum possible range, the function constructs a valid permutation.
   - **Constructing Permutations**: 
     - The function uses a greedy approach to construct permutations by swapping elements to minimize the Manhattan value.
     - The logic in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly to match the required Manhattan value.

4. **Testing**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the outputs match the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
