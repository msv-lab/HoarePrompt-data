Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input.**

The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The value of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
