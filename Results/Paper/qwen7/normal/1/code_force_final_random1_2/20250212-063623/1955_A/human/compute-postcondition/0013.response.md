Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A` is the first input integer divided by 2.
   - `B` is the second input integer.
   - `C` is the third input integer.
   - `B * 2` is less than `C`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.
   - However, there is no definition for `X` in the initial state provided.

Given the information, we cannot determine the value of `X` from the initial state. Since `X` is not defined, it cannot be substituted with any specific value. Therefore, the expression `X * C + B` remains in its symbolic form.

Output: **X * C + B**
