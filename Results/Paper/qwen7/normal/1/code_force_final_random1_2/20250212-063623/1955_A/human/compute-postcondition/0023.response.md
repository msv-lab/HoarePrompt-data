Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `A` is the first integer input.
- `B` is the second integer input.
- `C` is the third integer input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `X` is calculated as `A // 2`. This means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
2. The expression `X * C` multiplies `X` by `C`.
3. Adding `B` to the result of `X * C` gives the final value to be printed.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
