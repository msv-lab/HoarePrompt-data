Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the loop counter.
   - `input()`: This function is used to read input from the user.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run for `int(input())` iterations. This means the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value will determine how many times the loop will run.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop will run for `t` iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is valid (i.e., within the given range) and that `i` starts at 0 and increments correctly.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `t` and ensure that `i` is set to 0 initially. The value of `i` will be incremented within the loop body, but for the loop to start, `i` should be 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
