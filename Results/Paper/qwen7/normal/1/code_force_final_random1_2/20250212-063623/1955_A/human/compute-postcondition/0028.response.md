Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, and `next_input` is the fourth integer input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, or `next_input`. The value of `next_input` is updated to be the fourth integer input provided by the user since the previous `next_input` was the third integer.
