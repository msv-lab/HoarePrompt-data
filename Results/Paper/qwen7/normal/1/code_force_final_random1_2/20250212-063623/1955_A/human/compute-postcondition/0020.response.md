Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `A` is the first integer input.
- `B` is the second integer input.
- `C` is the third integer input.

The code snippet `print(A * B)` will multiply the value of `A` (the first integer input) by the value of `B` (the second integer input).

Therefore, the output will be the product of the first and second integer inputs.

Output: **A * B (where A is the first integer input and B is the second integer input)**
