Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is even, the current value of `A` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `A` is the first input integer divided by 2, `B` is the second input integer, and `C` is the third input integer with `B * 2` being less than `C`.
