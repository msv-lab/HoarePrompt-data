Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For each test case, it prints one of three possible values based on the conditions: \(A \times B\), \(\text{int}(A \times C / 2)\), or \(\text{X} \times C + B\) where \(\text{X} = A // 2\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
