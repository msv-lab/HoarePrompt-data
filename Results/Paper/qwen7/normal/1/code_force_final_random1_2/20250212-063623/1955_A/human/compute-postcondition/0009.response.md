Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
- The current value of `A` is even.

We need to determine the value of `int(A * C / 2)`.

Since `A` is an even integer and `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, we don't have specific values for `A` and `C` other than they are integers and `A` is even. However, we can still express the output in terms of these variables.

The expression `int(A * C / 2)` will compute the integer division of `A * C` by 2. Given that `A` is even, `A * C` will be even, and dividing it by 2 will yield an integer result.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2)**
