Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, and `next_input` is the fourth integer input provided by the user. If `B * 2 < C`, the condition is not met and the program continues without changing `X`. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`. If `A` is odd, `X` remains unchanged.**
