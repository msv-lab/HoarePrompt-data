Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.
   - The loop condition is `i < int(input())`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the current state remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `A` is even, the state also remains unchanged.
   - If `A` is odd, `i` is set to 0, `A` is set to the first input integer divided by 2, `B` is set to the second input integer, and `C` is set to the third input integer with `B * 2` being greater than or equal to `C`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0 (since the loop just started or was reset).
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.

5. **Determining the Next State**:
   - Since the loop just started, `i` is 0.
   - We need to determine the value of `int(input())` to know how many times the loop will run.
   - After reading the input, we check the conditions inside the loop.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - If the loop continues, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

7. **New State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**
