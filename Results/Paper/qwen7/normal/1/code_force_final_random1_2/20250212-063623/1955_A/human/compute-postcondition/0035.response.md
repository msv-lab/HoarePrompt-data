Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `t - 1`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are the last set of inputs provided by the user during the loop's execution. Depending on the conditions within the loop, either `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X * C + B` (where `X = A // 2`) was printed for each iteration. The variable `X` retains its final value after the last iteration based on the conditions evaluated.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `i` will be `t - 1`.
- The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be the last set of integers entered by the user.
- The output of the loop will be the result of the last condition evaluated (`A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X * C + B`), where `X = A // 2` if `A` was odd during the last iteration.
