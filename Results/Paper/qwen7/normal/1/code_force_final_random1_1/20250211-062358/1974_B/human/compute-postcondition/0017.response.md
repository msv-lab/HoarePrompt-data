Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `char` becomes the next character in `s`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `unique_chars` is updated to include the character `i` + 1.**

This means that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`s`, `char`, and `unique_chars`) remain as they were in the initial state, with `char` being set to the next character in `s` and `unique_chars` updated to include the character `i` + 1.
