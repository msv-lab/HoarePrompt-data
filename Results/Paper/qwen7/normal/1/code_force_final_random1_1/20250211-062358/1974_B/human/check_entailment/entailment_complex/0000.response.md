Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string `s` back to the original string `s`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not achieve this. Instead, it creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string and replaces each character in the encoded string with the corresponding character from this sorted list. This is not the correct approach for decoding.

2. **Decoding Logic**: To decode, we need to map each character in the encoded string back to its original character based on the mapping defined by the auxiliary string `r`. The provided function does not maintain this mapping correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the symmetric replacement rule described in the problem statement.

3. **Correct Approach**: We need to:
   - Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r` based on the symmetric rule.
   - Decode the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `r`.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly implement the decoding logic, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
