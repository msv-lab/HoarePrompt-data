Postcondition: `s` remains unchanged, `char` becomes the next character in `s`, and `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise). If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `j` is decremented by 1 and `s` is replaced with `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `unique_chars` is updated to include the character `i + 1`.
