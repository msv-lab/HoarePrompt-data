Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The string `b` is the result of encoding `s` using a specific algorithm.
2. **Encoding Process Recap**:
   - Construct an auxiliary string `r` containing all distinct characters of `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
3. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the process. Given `b`, we should construct `r` and then replace each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
4. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
   - The function `func_1(s)`:
     - Extracts unique characters from `s` and sorts them to get `r`.
     - Uses two pointers `i` and `j` to map each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
     - This approach seems flawed because it attempts to modify the string `s` directly, which is unnecessary and incorrect for decoding.
     - The function should create a mapping from `b` to `s` rather than modifying `s`.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation is incorrect because it tries to decode by modifying the string instead of creating a proper mapping. The correct approach would involve constructing the mapping between `b` and `s` and then using this mapping to decode.

Correctness: **False**
