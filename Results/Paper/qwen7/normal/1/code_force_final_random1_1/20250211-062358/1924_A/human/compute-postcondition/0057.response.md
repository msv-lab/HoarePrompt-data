Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `tmp` is 'b'.
   - `i` is an integer that was used in the calculation.
   - The condition `cur & 1 << i` equals 0 results in breaking out of the loop.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was used in the condition `cur & 1 << i`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.

4. **New State:**
   - `cur` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `tmp` remains 'b' as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'b', and `i` is an integer that is `i + 1` from its previous value.**
