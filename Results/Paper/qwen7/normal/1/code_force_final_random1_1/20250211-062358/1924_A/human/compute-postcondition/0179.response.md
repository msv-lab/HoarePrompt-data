Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a'**

Explanation: The code assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `ord('a') + i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `tmp` is assigned the value `'a'`. The conditions and values of `k` and `cur` remain unchanged.
