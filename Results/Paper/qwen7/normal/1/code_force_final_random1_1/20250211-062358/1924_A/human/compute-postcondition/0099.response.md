Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a', `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 3, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
