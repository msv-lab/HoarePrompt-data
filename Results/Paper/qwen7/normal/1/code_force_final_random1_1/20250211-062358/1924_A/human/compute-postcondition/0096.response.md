Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a', `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'**.

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Here, `1 << cur_ss` is equivalent to `2 ** cur_ss`. Since `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a', `cur` is updated to `2 ** cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.
