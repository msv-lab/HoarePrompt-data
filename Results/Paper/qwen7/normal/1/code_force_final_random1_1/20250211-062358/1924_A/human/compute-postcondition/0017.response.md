Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`.

Explanation: The if condition checks if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`. Since there is no else part, if the condition is true, the values of the variables will be as specified in the if part. If the condition is false, the values remain unchanged from the precondition. Given the absence of the else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes described in the if part.
