Output State: **`i` is equal to `k-1`, `cur` is an integer where the bits from 0 to `k-1` are checked and if any of them were not set, `tmp` is the corresponding character ('a' to 'j' if `k` is 10), otherwise `tmp` is 'b', and `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, and `ans` has been appended with 'a' \((n - cnt - 1)\) times.**

This means that the string `ans` has been updated by appending 'a' repeated \(n - cnt - 1\) times to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
