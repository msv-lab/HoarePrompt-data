Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is the total length of the string `s` plus 1, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, and `s` is now an updated string.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
