Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is the total length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `s`. The variable `cnt` will count how many times `cur` reaches the value \(2^k - 1\), which happens when all bits in `cur` are set (i.e., `cur` is equal to \(2^k - 1\)). The variable `cur` resets to 0 at the end of each successful count, so its final value will be 0. The variable `ans` accumulates characters from `s` that contribute to making `cur` equal to \(2^k - 1\).
