Output State: **`i` is 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `tmp` is 'b'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` takes the ASCII value of 'a', adds the value of `i` (which is 1), and converts it back to a character. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97. Adding 1 to 97 gives 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Since `i` remains unchanged at 1 and the condition for `k` is still that it must be greater than 0, these values are included in the output state.
