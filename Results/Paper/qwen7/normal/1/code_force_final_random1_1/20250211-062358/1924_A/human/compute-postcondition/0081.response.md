Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a', the current value of `cur` is 0, the current value of `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables (`ss`, `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
