Output State: **`cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the next character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the next character in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts `1` left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Since `cur` initially is `1 << cur_ss`, after executing the code, `cur` becomes `1 << cur_ss + 1 << cur_ss`, which simplifies to `1 << cur_ss * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
