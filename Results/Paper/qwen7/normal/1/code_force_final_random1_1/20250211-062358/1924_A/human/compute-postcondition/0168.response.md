Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (new value is `cnt + 1`), `ans` is updated to include the current value of `ss`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` concatenates the current value of `ss` to the end of the string stored in `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
