Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'**.

Explanation: The code `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` (stored in `ss`) minus the ASCII value of 'a', and assigns this value to `cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.
