Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, and `tmp` is 'c'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp`. Here, `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Adding `i` (which is 2) to 97 gives 99, and `chr(99)` returns the character corresponding to the ASCII value 99, which is 'c'. Therefore, `tmp` is updated to 'c'. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
