Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is the total length of the string `s` plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
