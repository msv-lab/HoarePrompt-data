Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `cur` is 0 (not part of the loop head)
   - `tmp` is 'a' (not part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `k` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 1
   - `k` must still be greater than 0
   - `cur` and `tmp` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0**
