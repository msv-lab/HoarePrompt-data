Postcondition: **The final value of `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s`, `cnt` is the total number of times the inner condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, and all other variables (`cur`, `cur_ss`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`) remain as they were in the initial state. Additionally, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
