Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `tmp` is 'b'

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < k`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - Since `k` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - The value of `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `tmp` remains 'b' unless the loop body changes it, but no such change is mentioned.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, and `tmp` is 'b'**
