Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k` used in the `range(k)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(k)` generates values from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `k`**: Since the loop will execute for each value of `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**: All other variables (`ans`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `cur`, `cur_ss`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`) remain as they were in the initial state, and their values do not directly affect the loop execution.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly. This means `k` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0 (the starting value).
- `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
