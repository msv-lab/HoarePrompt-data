Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << i)` evaluates to 0; `tmp` is 'a', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
