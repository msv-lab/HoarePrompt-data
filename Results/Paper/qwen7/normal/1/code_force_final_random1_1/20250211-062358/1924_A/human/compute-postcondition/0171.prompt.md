Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is '', `cnt` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'd', `cur_ss` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is `ss`, `cur` is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 1. This is because the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is never met, hence the else part does not execute, and the if part always runs, keeping `cur` unchanged at 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ss` is the second character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the second character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss` or `0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
