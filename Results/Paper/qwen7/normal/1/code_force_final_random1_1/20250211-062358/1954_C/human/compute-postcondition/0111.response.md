Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while i < len(a)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1 + 1. This simplifies to `i` being equal to the length of `a`.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(a)`. Since `i` is already equal to `len(a)`, the condition `i < len(a)` is false.

4. **Adjusting the state**: To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted such that `i < len(a)` becomes true. This means `i` should be set to a value less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is less than `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`**
