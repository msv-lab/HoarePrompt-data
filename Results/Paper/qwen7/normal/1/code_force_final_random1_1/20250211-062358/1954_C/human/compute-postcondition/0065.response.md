Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)` - 1 + 1; `new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`; `new` is a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` and the last element is updated to `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` and the last element remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
