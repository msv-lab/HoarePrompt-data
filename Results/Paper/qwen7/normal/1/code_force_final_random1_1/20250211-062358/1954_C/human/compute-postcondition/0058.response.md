Output State: **`i` is 4; `new2[4]` is the minimum of `a[4]` and `b[4]`; `a[3] == b[3]` is true**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `new2[4]` is set to the minimum of `a[4]` and `b[4]`. The condition `a[3] == b[3]` remains unchanged as it was already known to be true.
