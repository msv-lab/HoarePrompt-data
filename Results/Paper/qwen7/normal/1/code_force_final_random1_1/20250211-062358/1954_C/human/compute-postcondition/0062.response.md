Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` for all executed iterations, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` for all executed iterations. The current value of `i` is not equal to the length of `a`.**
