Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)` - 1, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially less than `len(a)`, after incrementing, `i` is now less than `len(a)` - 1. The values of `new` and `new2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
