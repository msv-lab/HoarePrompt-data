Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1 + 1; `new` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1` with the exception that `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`; `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; the condition `i != len(a)` holds.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial definitions. The condition `i != len(a)` still holds since `i` was initially set to `len(a) - 1` and now `i` is `len(a)`.
