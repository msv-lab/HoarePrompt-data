Output State: **`new2[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new[i]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new[i+1]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `new2[i]`, `new[i]`, and `new[i+1]` remain unchanged from their previous assignments based on the conditions given. The precondition that `i` must be less than the length of `a` is still valid.
