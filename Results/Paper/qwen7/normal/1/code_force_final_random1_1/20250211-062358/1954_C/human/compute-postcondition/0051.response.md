Output State: **`i` is 1; `len(a)` is a fixed value; `a[0] == b[0]` is true; `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The other variables (`len(a)`, `a[0] == b[0]`, `new[0]`, and `new2[0]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
