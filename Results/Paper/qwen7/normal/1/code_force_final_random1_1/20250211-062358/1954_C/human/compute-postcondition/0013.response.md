Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` (which is 3 since `i` was 2 or more), `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]` or the condition holds true for the next index, `new[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 2 or more, after incrementing, `i` becomes `i + 1`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged as no operations were performed on `a[2]`, `b[2]`, `new[i]`, or `new2[i]`.
