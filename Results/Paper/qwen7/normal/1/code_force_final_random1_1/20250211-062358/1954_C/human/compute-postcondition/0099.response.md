Output State: **`i` is 3; `new2[3]` is equal to `min(a[3], b[3])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[3]` and `b[3]` to `new2[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used as an index here. The initial value of `new[3]` being `max(a[3], b[3])` does not affect the new assignment to `new2[3]`.
