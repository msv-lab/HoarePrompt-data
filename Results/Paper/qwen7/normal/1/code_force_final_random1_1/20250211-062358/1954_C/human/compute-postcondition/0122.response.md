To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.
   - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The `new` list is constructed such that each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`.
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of the `new` list into a single string, with each element converted to a string and concatenated together.

Given this analysis, the output will be a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in the `new` list.

**Output:**
Output: **a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in the `new` list**
