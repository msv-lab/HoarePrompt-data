Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`; `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `a` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of `a`. During each iteration, the elements of `new` and `new2` are updated such that `new[j]` contains `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` contains `max(a[j], b[j])` for each index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`. Once the loop terminates, `i` will no longer satisfy the condition `i < len(a)`, and the final states of `new` and `new2` will reflect the minimum and maximum values between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` respectively.
