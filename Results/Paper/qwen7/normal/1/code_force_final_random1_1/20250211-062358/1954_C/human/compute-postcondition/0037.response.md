Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will finally be equal to the length of list `a`. The lists `new` and `new2` will have been updated such that for every index `i` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[i]` contains the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`), and `new2[i]` contains the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`).
