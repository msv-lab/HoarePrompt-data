Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`; `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`; `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.**

Explanation: After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`. The list `new` will contain the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `len(a)-1`, and the list `new2` will contain the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `len(a)-1`. This is true regardless of whether the if condition is satisfied or not, as the else part does not change the postcondition.
