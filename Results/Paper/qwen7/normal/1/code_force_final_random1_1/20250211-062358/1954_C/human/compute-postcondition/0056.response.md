Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `len(a)` is a fixed value (let's denote it as `L`)
   - `a[0] == b[0]` is true
   - `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`
   - `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`
   - `new[2]` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`
   - `new2[2]` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves two parts: `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4 (assuming `len(a)` is at least 4).
   - Additionally, `a[3] == b[3]` must be true for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to increment `i` to 4.
   - We need to ensure that `a[3] == b[3]` is true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the condition `a[3] == b[3]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `a[3] == b[3]` is true**
