Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the length of list `a`. The lists `new` and `new2` will contain the maximum and minimum values respectively, for each index where the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` are equal during the loop's execution.
