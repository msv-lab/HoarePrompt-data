Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.
- `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.

The `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))` statement will join all elements of the `new2` list into a single string, converting each element to a string before joining.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `new2`. However, we know that each element in `new2` is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations.

Therefore, the output will be a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in `new2`.

Output: **a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in new2**
