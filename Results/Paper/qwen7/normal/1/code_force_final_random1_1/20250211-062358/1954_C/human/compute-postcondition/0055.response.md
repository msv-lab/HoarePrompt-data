The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. The values of `len(a)`, `a[0]`, `b[0]`, `new[0]`, `new2[0]`, `a[2]`, `b[2]`, `new[2]`, and `new2[2]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `len(a)` is a fixed value, `a[0] == b[0]` is true, `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new[2]` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `new2[2]` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`.**
