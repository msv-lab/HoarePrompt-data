Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i+1]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial conditions state that `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`, the updated value of `i` is still within the valid range. The values of `new2[i]`, `new[i]`, and `new[i+1]` remain unchanged from their initial assignments based on the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `b[i+1]`.
