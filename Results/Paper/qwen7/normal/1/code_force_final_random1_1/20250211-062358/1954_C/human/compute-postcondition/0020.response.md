Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations; `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. The if condition is now false since `i` is equal to `len(a)`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
