Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros with one element incremented by 1 where the index is the ASCII value of the new `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A', and `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the list `freq` has had its corresponding index (based on the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A') incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their initial states, except for `freq` which now has one more count at the specified index.
