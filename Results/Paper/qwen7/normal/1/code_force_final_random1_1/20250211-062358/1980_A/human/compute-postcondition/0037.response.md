Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') found in the original list `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and (m - f) for each f in `freq`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `missing` by iterating over the `freq` list and computing the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element `f` in `freq`. This value is then summed up to get `missing`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
