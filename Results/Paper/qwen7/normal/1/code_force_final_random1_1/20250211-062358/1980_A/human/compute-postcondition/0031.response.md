Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros with one element incremented by 1 where the index is the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A'.**

This means that the `freq` list has been updated by incrementing the count at the index corresponding to the character `prob` in the alphabet (i.e., 'A' corresponds to index 0, 'B' to index 1, etc.). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
