    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the 'missing' value for each iteration, with a total length equal to the original value of 't'. Each 'missing' value is calculated as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'm' and 'f' for each pair of 'm' in 'freq' and 'f' in 'freq', where 'freq' is a list of length 26 and each index 'ord(prob) - ord('A')' is incremented by the number of times its corresponding character appears across all lists 'a' in 'test_cases'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of integers. Each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. For each test case, it processes a string of problem difficulties and determines how many more problems are required to meet the specified number of upcoming rounds (`m`). The calculation involves counting the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') across all problems in the test cases, then determining the shortfall between the required number of problems (`m`) and the current count (`f`) for each difficulty level. The function sums these shortfalls to produce the result for each test case.
