Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', and the function definition is unchanged.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function that calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create based on the given parameters. However, the actual function body is not provided, so no variables are modified. The initial state remains unchanged.
