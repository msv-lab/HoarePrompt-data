Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the 'missing' value for each iteration, with a total length equal to the original value of 't'. Each 'missing' value is calculated as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'm' and 'f' for each pair of 'm' in 'freq' and 'f' in 'freq', where 'freq' is a list of length 26 and each index 'ord(prob) - ord('A')' is incremented by the number of times its corresponding character appears across all lists 'a' in 'test_cases'.**

This means the program returns a list where each element corresponds to the 'missing' value calculated from the 'freq' list for each iteration, and the length of this list is the same as the original value of 't'.
