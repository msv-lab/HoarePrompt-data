Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (with 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. After processing, the function returns a list named 'results' containing the 'missing' value for each iteration, with a total length equal to the original value of `t`. Each 'missing' value is calculated as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and `f` for each pair of `m` in 'freq' and `f` in 'freq', where 'freq' is a list of length 26 and each index 'ord(prob) - ord('A')' is incremented by the number of times its corresponding character appears across all lists 'a' in 'test_cases'.**
