Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `m`, `a` are assigned the values from `test_cases[_]`; `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `freq` with 7 elements, each set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new list `freq` is created and initialized with zeros.
