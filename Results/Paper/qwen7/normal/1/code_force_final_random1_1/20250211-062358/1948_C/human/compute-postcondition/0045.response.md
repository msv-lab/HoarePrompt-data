Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, `b` is updated to the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged with their initial or previously assigned values.
