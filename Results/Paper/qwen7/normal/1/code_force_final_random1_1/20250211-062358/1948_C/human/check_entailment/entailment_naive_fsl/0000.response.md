Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only a few conditions and prints 'No' prematurely without considering all possible valid paths. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
<<>>
><>>
```

For this input, the program should output 'YES', but it incorrectly outputs 'NO'. The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

The program fails to account for all possible valid paths and prematurely concludes that the robot cannot reach the target cell. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
