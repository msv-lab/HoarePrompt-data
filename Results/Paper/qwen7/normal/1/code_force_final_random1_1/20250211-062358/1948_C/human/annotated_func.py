#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>' representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for all odd numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. After all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking, the output will be 'yes'. If the loop breaks due to the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` being true at any point, the output will be 'No'. The final value of `n` will be the last odd number processed by the loop, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and the strings `a` and `b` will retain their original values from the last input provided to the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index i (where i is an odd number less than n) such that the character at index i in the first string matches the character at either index i+1 or i-1 in the second string and both are '<'. If such an index is found, it prints 'No' and stops processing further. If no such index is found after checking all valid indices, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
