Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

Given the constraints, the function likely evaluates the two strings to determine some property or outcome related to the arrows represented by '<' and '>', but without more specific details on the logic, the focus here is on the parameters and the nature of the input.
