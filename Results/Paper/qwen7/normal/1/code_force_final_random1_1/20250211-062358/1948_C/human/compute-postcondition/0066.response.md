Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index i (where i is an odd number less than n) such that the character at index i in the first string matches the character at either index i+1 or i-1 in the second string and both are '<'. If such an index is found, it prints 'No' and stops processing further. If no such index is found after checking all valid indices, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
