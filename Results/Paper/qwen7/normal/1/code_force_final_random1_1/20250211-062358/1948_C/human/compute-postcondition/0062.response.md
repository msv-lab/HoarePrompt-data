Output State: `n` must be at least 5 and an odd number, `i` is equal to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains 0, and the strings `a` and `b` remain as they were initially input by the user. If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are met for any `i`), the final output will be 'yes'. If any of these conditions are met for any `i`, the loop will break and the output will be 'No'.
