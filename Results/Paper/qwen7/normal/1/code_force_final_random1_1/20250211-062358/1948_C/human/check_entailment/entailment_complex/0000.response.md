Reasoning:

The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is flawed. This condition checks if the current cell in the first row (`a[i]`) and either the next or previous cell in the second row (`b[i + 1]` or `b[i - 1]`) both have arrows pointing left. However, the robot's movement is determined by the arrow in the current cell, not the adjacent cells. Therefore, the robot should move according to the direction of the arrow in the current cell, not check adjacent cells.

2. **Movement Logic**: The logic for determining if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` is not correctly implemented. The provided code only checks if there is a leftward movement condition that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell, but it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid.

3. **Edge Cases**: The provided solution does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not consider the possibility of the robot moving right and then down, or moving left and then up, which are necessary to reach the target cell.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

Correctness: **False**
