Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, `step` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of characters and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `step`, `a`, and `b`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
