You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    >><<
    
    >>><
    
    2

    >>><
    
    >><<
    
    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index i (where i is an odd number less than n) such that the character at index i in the first string matches the character at either index i+1 or i-1 in the second string and both are '<'. If such an index is found, it prints 'No' and stops processing further. If no such index is found after checking all valid indices, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows (`a` and `b`).

2. **Loop Through Columns:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through every second column starting from index 1 (i.e., odd indices).
   - This is done using `for i in range(1, n, 2)`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - For each odd-indexed column `i`, the program checks two conditions:
     - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`
     - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`
   - If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Else Block Execution:**
   - If none of the conditions in the loop are met, the program prints 'yes'.

### Reasoning

The logic in the program is flawed because it does not fully consider the movement of the robot according to the arrows. Specifically:

- The program only checks if the robot can move from an odd-indexed column to an adjacent column with a specific pattern of arrows.
- It does not simulate the actual movement of the robot through the grid.
- The conditions checked are too restrictive and do not cover all possible valid paths the robot can take.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
<>><
><>>
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4).
- The path could be: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4).

However, the program would incorrectly print 'No' because it does not allow the robot to move from (1, 2) to (2, 2) and then from (2, 3) to (1, 3).

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly simulate the robot's movement based on the arrows in the grid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
