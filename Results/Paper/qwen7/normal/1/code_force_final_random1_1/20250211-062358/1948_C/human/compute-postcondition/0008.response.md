Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `step` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of characters. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we are currently inside. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `step`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
