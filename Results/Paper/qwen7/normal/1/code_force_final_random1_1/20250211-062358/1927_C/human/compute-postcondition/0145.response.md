Output State: **`t` is `int(input()) + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial state sets `t` to `int(input()) + 1`. The code snippet then reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are directly assigned from the input, their specific values are unknown, but they are known to be integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
