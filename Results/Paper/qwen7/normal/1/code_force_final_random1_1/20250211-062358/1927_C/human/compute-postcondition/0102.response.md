Postcondition: `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, `aOnes` is either equal to `aOnes` + 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.
