Postcondition: `i` is 3, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `aOnes` is either 1 (if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` or `bOnes+1`), or `bOnes` or `bOnes+1` (if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes` or `bOnes+1`), `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
