Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
