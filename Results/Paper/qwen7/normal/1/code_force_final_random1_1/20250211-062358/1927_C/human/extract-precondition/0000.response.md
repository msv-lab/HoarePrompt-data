Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains n integers representing array a, the second line contains m integers representing array b, and the third line contains t test cases. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**
