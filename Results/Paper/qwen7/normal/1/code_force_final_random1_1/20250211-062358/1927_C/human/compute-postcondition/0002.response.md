Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
