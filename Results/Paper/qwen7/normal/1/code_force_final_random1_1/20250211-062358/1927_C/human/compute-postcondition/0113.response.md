Output State: **`i` is 2, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, `k` must be at least 3**

The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. Since `bOnes` can initially be either 0 or 1, after the increment, it will become either 1 or 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
