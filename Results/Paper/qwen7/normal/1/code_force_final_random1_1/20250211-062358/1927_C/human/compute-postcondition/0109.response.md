Output State: **`i` is 2, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, `k` must be at least 3**

The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Since `bOnes` was either 0 or 1 initially, after executing `bOnes += 1`, `bOnes` will now be either 1 or 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
