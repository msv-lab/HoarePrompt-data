Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is 1 or 0, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` must be greater than or equal to 1, either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, and `(i not in a or aOnes > newk)`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
