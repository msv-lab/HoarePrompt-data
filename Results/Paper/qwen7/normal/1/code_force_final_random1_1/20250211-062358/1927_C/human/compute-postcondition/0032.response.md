Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are incremented according to their current values relative to each other and `newk`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is set to 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` remains 0.
