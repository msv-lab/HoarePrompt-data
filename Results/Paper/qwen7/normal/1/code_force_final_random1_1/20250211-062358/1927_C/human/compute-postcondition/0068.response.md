Postcondition: **`i` is `k + 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`, `aOnes` is the total count of numbers present in `a` up to `k` but not in `b` or present in `b` with a count less than or equal to `bOnes`, `newk` is `k // 2`, and the condition `aOnes == newk` and `bOnes == newk` either holds true or false.**
