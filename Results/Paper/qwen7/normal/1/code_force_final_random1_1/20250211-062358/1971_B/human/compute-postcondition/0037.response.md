Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input received, `b` is a sorted string of the unique characters from the new input received, `c` is a string containing the sorted unique characters from the new input in reverse order.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the program fragment does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, regardless of whether the condition `b == s` is true or false, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
