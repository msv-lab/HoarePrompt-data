Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1 (since it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration), `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and is unchanged throughout the loop executions, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input string `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of the unique characters in `a`, and `c` is a string containing these sorted unique characters in reverse order.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `t` will still be within the range 1 to 1000, as it was not modified by the loop. The variable `n` will be 0 or negative (depending on how many inputs were provided) since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed, and `a` will contain the unique characters from this string. Depending on the condition of the set `a`, either `b` or `c` will be printed, representing the sorted and reverse-sorted versions of the unique characters, respectively.
