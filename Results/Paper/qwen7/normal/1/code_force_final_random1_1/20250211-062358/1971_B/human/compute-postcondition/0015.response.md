Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the size of the set `a` is 2, no changes are made. If the size of the set `a` is not 2, `b` is a sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the reverse sorted version of `s`, but no further changes are made to `s`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.
