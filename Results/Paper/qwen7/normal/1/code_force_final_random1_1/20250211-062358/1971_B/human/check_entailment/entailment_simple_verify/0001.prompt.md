You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1 (since it starts as a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration), `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and is unchanged throughout the loop executions, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input string `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of the unique characters in `a`, and `c` is a string containing these sorted unique characters in reverse order.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `t` will still be within the range 1 to 1000, as it was not modified by the loop. The variable `n` will be 0 or negative (depending on how many inputs were provided) since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed, and `a` will contain the unique characters from this string. Depending on the condition of the set `a`, either `b` or `c` will be printed, representing the sorted and reverse-sorted versions of the unique characters, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - The program converts the string `s` into a set `a` to get unique characters.
   - If the set `a` has exactly 2 elements (i.e., `len(a) == 2`), it prints 'NO'. This condition is checking if the string has exactly two distinct characters, meaning any rearrangement would still result in the same string.

3. **Generating Rearranged String:**
   - If the string does not have exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` in both ascending (`b`) and descending (`c`) order.
   - If the sorted string `b` is the same as the original string `s`, it prints the reversed sorted string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Checking Correctness:

1. **Case with Exactly Two Distinct Characters:**
   - For strings like `"aaaaa"` or `"bbbbb"`, the program correctly identifies that no rearrangement can produce a different string and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Case with More Than Two Distinct Characters:**
   - For strings like `"codeforces"`, the program correctly identifies that rearrangements can produce different strings and outputs a valid rearrangement.
   - For strings like `"co"`, the program also correctly outputs 'YES' and a valid rearrangement.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles strings with more than two distinct characters correctly.
   - The program handles strings with fewer than 10 characters correctly (as per the problem constraints).

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'YES' followed by a valid rearranged string when applicable.
   - The program outputs 'NO' when no valid rearrangement is possible.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to check if a string can be rearranged to form a different string and outputs the correct results for all given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
