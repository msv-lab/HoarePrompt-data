Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted version of `s`, `c` is the reverse sorted version of `s`. If `b` is equal to `s`, no changes are made. If `b` is not equal to `s`, no changes are made either.**
