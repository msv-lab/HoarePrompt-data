Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - `s` is the input received (this does not change within the loop head)
   - `t` remains the same (this does not change within the loop head)
   - `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s` (this does not change within the loop head)

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must be true. Since `i` is currently 2 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Final State After Adjusting**:
   - `i` is now 3
   - `n` must remain greater than 0
   - `s`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`**
