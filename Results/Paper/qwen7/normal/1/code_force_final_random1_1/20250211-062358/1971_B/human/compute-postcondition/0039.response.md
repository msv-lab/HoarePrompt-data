Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input received, `t` remains the same. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, the program does nothing additional. Otherwise, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input received, `b` is a sorted string of these unique characters, and `c` is a string containing these sorted unique characters in reverse order.
