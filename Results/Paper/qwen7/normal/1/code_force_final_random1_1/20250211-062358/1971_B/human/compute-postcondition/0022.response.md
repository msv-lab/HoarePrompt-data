Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `s` is the input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`.**

The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the string `s` and assigns it to `b`. The sorting does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `i`, `n`, `t`, and `a` stay the same, while `b` now holds the sorted version of `s`.
