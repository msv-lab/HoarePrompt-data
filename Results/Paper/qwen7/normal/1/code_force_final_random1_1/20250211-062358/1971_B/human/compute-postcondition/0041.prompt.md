Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the size of the set `a` is 2, no changes are made. If the size of the set `a` is not 2, `b` is a sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the reverse sorted version of `s`. No changes are made in either case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `s` is the input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of `s` in ascending order, and `c` is a sorted string of `s` in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input received, `t` remains the same. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, the program does nothing additional. Otherwise, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input received, `b` is a sorted string of these unique characters, and `c` is a string containing these sorted unique characters in reverse order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
