Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `s` is the input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of `s` in ascending order, and `c` is a sorted string of `s` in descending order.**
