Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the string consists of exactly two distinct characters. For such cases, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because the set `a` will contain exactly two elements. However, according to the problem description, if no such string `r` exists (which means the string cannot be rearranged to be different from the original), the program should output "NO". 

For example, consider the input `aaaaa`. The program will output "NO", but according to the problem description, since the string can be rearranged to be different (e.g., "aaaaa" can be rearranged to "aaaba"), the correct output should be "YES" followed by a rearranged string like "aaaba".

Here is an example of a failing case:
- Input: `aaaaa`
- Expected Output: 
```
YES
aaaba
```
- Actual Output: 
```
NO
```
