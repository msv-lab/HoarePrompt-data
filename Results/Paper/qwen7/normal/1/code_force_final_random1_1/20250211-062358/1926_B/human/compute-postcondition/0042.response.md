Postcondition: `b` is the new input string from the user, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` plus one followed by the previous value of `k[1]`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then the count of '1' in `b` plus one is stored in `k[0]` and the previous value of `k[1]` is stored in `k[1]`. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', then the previous value of `k[1]` remains unchanged and is still stored in `k[1]`.
