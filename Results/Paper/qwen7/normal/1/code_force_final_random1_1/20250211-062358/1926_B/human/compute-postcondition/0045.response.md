Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' in each of the input strings provided during the loop executions.
- The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.

The print statement is simply `print('SQUARE')`.

Since the print statement is not dependent on the values of any variables or lists but instead is printing a hardcoded string, the output will be exactly as specified.

Output: **SQUARE**
