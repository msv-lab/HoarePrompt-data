Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. The logic in the program checks if the counts of '1's in the rows are the same, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. For example, consider the following grid:

```
5

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000
```

This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the counts of '1's in the rows are the same (3, 2, 1, 0, 0). The program needs to check the specific patterns of '1's to determine if they form a triangle or a square.
