Output State: **`b` is the final input string provided by the user, and `k` is a list containing the sum of counts of '1' from each input string provided during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `b` will hold the last input string provided by the user. The variable `k` will accumulate the count of '1's from each input string provided during the loop iterations, resulting in a list where each element represents the count of '1's in the corresponding input string.
