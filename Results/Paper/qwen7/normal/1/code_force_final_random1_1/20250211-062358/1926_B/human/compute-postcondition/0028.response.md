Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used for iterating over the range, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `int(input())`: This is the value that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. If `int(input())` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the one related to the loop's condition, which is `int(input())`.

Given that `k` is an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
