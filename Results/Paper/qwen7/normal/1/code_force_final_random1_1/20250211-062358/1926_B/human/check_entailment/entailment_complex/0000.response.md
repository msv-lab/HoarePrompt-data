Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining whether the '1's in the grid form a square or a triangle.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by counting the number of '1's in each row and checking if these counts match.
3. However, the logic in the code is flawed:
   - The code only checks the first two counts (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) to decide between a square and a triangle.
   - This approach is insufficient because:
     - A square would have rows with the same number of '1's, but the code does not check if all rows have the same count.
     - A triangle would have rows with increasing counts, starting from 1 and ending at some maximum, but the code does not account for this pattern.
4. The provided example outputs show that the code does not correctly identify squares and triangles based on the given criteria.

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the '1's form a square or a triangle. It only checks the first two counts, which is insufficient for identifying both shapes accurately.
