### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified the main issue with the provided program. The program only checks if all counts of `1`s in each row are the same to determine if the shape is a square. This approach is insufficient for identifying triangles, as it does not account for the specific patterns required to distinguish between squares and triangles.

To correctly identify the shape, we need to check for the following patterns:
- **Square:** All rows must have the same number of `1`s.
- **Triangle:** The counts of `1`s in each row must follow the sequence `[1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1]` or `[2k-1, 2k-3, ..., 1]`.

The provided program does not implement these checks. Instead, it simply compares the counts of `1`s in each row, which can lead to incorrect results for triangles.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the program is indeed incorrect because it fails to correctly identify triangles.

**Final: False**
