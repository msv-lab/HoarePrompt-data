The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid represented as a list of strings containing '0's and '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's in each row and checks if the counts match. If the counts match, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The function does not return any value but prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the grid configuration. If no valid shape is found or multiple shapes are present, it will print an error message.
