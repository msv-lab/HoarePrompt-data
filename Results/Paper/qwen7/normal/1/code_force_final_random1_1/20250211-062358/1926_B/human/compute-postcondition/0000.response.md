Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ a ≤ 10**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and its value is still an integer between 1 and 100. Additionally, since no other information about the grid is provided in the code snippet, we maintain the condition that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, but no further details about the grid itself are updated.
