Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `a`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `b` is the final input string provided by the user.
   - `k` is a list containing the sum of counts of '1' from each input string provided during the loop iterations.
4. **Postcondition**: 
   - If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, no change is made to `k`.
   - Otherwise, the values in `k` reflect the sums of counts of '1' where the first and second elements are not equal.

Given that the loop continues as long as `i < a`, at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` would be equal to `a-1` (since it increments before checking the condition).
- `a` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented to `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `a`.
- `a` remains the same.

Since the postcondition does not affect the loop continuation directly, we don't need to adjust `b` or `k` based on the given information.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `a`, `a` is the same**
