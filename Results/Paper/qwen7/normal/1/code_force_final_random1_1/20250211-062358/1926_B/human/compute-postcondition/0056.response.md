Output State: **`b` is the input string from the user, and the string `b` contains the character '1'; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`, which is 1.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `b`. Since the initial state mentions that the string `b` contains the character '1', the count of '1' in `b` is 1. This count is then appended to the list `k`. Therefore, `k` now contains the value 1.
