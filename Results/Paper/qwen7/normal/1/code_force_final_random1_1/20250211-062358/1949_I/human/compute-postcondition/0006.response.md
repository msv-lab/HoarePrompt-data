Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state; it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will be set to 0 initially, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
