Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `coef[i]` is set to 1.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `coef[i]` will be set to 1 for the new value of `i`.
   - `tot` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `ok` will be evaluated based on the new value of `i` and the current values of `bipartite` and `tot`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `coef[i]` will be set to 1.
- `tot` remains 0.
- `bipartite` remains unchanged.
- `ok` will be evaluated based on the new value of `i` and the current values of `bipartite` and `tot`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**
