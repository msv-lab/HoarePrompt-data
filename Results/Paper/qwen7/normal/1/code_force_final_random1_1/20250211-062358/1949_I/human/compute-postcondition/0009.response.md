Output State: **`i` is 2, `x[1]`, `y[1]`, `r[1]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` was initially 1, after the assignment, `i` becomes 2. The values of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` are the integers entered by the user. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
