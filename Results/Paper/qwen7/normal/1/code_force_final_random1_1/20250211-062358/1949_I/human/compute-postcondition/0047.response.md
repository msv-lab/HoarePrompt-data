Postcondition: **All elements in `visited` are set to True, `coef` contains 1s at indices where nodes were visited, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains True or False based on the graph's bipartiteness, and `ok` is True if any `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0 during any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains False.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the `if` or `else` part is executed, the final state of the variables `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` will remain consistent with their definitions provided in the precondition. Specifically, `visited` and `coef` will reflect the visitation status of nodes, `tot` will be reset to 0, `bipartite` will indicate the bipartiteness of the graph, and `ok` will be determined based on the conditions specified.
