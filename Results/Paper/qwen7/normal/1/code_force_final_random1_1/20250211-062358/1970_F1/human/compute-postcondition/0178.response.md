Postcondition: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is `team_value` (the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`) and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program after executing the if-else block. It ensures that regardless of whether the condition `com == 'T'` is met or not, the following conditions hold:
- `command` remains unchanged.
- `obj` and `com` are the first and second elements of `command`, respectively.
- `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` list.
- `nxt` is the new position calculated based on the movement direction specified by `com`.
- `obj` is not equal to '.B'.
- `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False.
- `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
- If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is set to `team_value` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
- If `com` is not 'T', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
