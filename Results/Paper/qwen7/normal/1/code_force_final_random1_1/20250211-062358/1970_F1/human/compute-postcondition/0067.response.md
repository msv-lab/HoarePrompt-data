Output State: **`elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind + 1]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind + 1)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind + 1` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind + 1]` is not `'..'`, and `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' else 1, and the condition `line[ind + 1][1] == 'G'` is checked. If true, `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The line `elements[line[ind]] = i, ind` updates the dictionary `elements` such that the key `line[ind]` is mapped to the tuple `(i, ind)`.
- The variable `ind` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
