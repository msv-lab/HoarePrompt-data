Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings, `command` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), and `elements[obj]` is also updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]) if the player is at position `obj`. If the player is not at position `obj`, the values remain unchanged.
