Output State: **`command` is a list of strings, `comand` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is False.**

Explanation: The line `allPlayers[obj] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers[obj]` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `command`, `comand`, `time`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
