Output State: **`command` is a list of three strings, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` and its value is '.S.', `team` is 1**.

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of the string `obj[0]` is 'B'. Since the initial value of `el` is '.S.', which means the first character of `obj` is not 'B', the condition `obj[0] == 'B'` evaluates to False. Therefore, `team` is assigned the value 0's counterpart, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
