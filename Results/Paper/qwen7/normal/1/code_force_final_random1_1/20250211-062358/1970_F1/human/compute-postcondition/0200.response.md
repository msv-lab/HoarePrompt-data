Output State: **`command` is a list of strings, `comand` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.**

This means that the variable `player` has been assigned a new value based on the condition: if `obj` is a player, then `player` is set to `obj`; otherwise, `player` is set to the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
