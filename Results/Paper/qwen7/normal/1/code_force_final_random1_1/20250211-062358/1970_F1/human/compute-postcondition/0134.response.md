Output State: **`comand` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code `comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. The resulting list is stored in the variable `comand`. Since no specific input is given, we cannot determine the exact content of `comand`, but we know it is a list of strings derived from the input. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is effectively unchanged by this operation.
