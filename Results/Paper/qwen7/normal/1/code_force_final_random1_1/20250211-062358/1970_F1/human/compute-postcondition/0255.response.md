Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a 2D list of strings called grid, a dictionary called elements, a dictionary called allPlayers, a list of lists called goal, and a list of two integers called points. The function does not return anything.**

This means the function `func_1` takes in several parameters including dimensions of a grid, a representation of the grid itself, mappings of elements and players, goal locations for two teams, and the current scores. However, since no return value is mentioned, the function likely performs some operation or updates the state based on these inputs without returning any output.
