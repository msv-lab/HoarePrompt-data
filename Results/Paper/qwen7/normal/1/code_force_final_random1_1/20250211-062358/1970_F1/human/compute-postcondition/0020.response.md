Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[ind]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[ind]`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, and the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'.**

This output state reflects that the variable `tmp` is assigned a value based on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not. The values of `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, `grid`, `isPlayer(line[ind])`, and the character at index `ind` in `line` remain unchanged from the initial state, except for the assignment to `tmp`.
