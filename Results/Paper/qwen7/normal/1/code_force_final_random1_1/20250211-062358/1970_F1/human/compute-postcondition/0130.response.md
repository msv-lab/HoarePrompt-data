Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to `len(line)`, `i` will still be 0, `n` will remain an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` will be a list of strings read from `stdin`, `grid` will be a list containing `n` elements where each element is the list `line`, `elements` will be a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in `line`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then either `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`. The `points` list remains `[0, 0]`.
