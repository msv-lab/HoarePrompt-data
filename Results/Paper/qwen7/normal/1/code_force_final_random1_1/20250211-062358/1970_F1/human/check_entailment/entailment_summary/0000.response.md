Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the game grid, players, goals, and points.
   - It processes each command in the sequence, updating the positions of players and handling actions like catching the Quaffle, throwing it, moving, and checking for goals.
   - The function correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
   - After processing all commands, it prints the final score.
   
2. **Function `goalIn`**:
   - This function correctly determines which team's goal a given position corresponds to, returning 0 for a red goal, 1 for a blue goal, and -1 for any other position.
   
3. **Function `isPlayer`**:
   - This function correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player (not a goal).

Given these observations, the implementation of `func_1` aligns with the problem description and handles all aspects of the game as specified. The functions `goalIn` and `isPlayer` support `func_1` in making the correct decisions during the game.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
