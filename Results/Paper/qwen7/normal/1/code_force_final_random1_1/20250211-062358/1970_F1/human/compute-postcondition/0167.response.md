Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element.
   - `obj` is not equal to '.B'.
   - `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is `False`.
   - `isPlayer(obj)` is `True` or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
   - `com` is equal to 'T'.
   - `team` is `team_value` (the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`).

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `com` is 'T', so `mov['T'][0]` and `mov['T'][1]` determine the movement direction.
- `team` is determined by `goalIn(pos)`, but since `team` is `team_value`, we can use `team_value` directly in the print statement.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output:
- `time`: This is an unspecified value from the initial state, so it remains as `time`.
- `GoalName[team]`: Since `team` is `team_value`, this will be `GoalName[team_value]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **%d GoalName[team_value]** (where `%d` is the value of `time` and `team_value` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`).
