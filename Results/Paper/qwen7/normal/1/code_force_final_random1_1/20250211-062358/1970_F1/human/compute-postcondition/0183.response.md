Postcondition: **`elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is `team_value` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both the case when the condition `obj == '.B'` is true and when it is false (though there is no else part in the provided code).
