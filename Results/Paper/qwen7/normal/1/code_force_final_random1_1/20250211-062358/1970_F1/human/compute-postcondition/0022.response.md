Postcondition: `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[ind]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[ind]`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, and if the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[ind]]` and `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[ind]`; additionally, the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to the list `goal[0]` if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to the list `goal[1]`.
