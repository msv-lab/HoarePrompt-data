Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings. If the length of `command` is 3, then `command` is a list of three strings where the first element is stored in `obj`, the second element is stored in `com`. Depending on the third element (`el`):
- If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
- If `el` is '.S.', then `team` is set to 1 and `points[team]` is set to 10.
- If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S.', then no changes are made to `allPlayers`, `team`, or `points`.

Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is set to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is `team_value` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
