Output State: **`time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `comand` is an empty list, `obj` is defined but `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, `points[team]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
