Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(stdin.readline().strip())`, `i` will be incremented by the sum of the values of `elements[line[ind]]` for each iteration, `ind` will be set to the last index processed in the loop, `n` will remain an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` will be a list of strings read from `stdin` until the end of input, `grid` will be a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list `line` representing a row of the input grid, `elements` will be a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in any of the lines, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in its respective line. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then either `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` will contain tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in the respective line.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings. If the length of `command` is 3, then `command` is a list of three strings where the first element is stored in `obj`, the second element is stored in `com`. Depending on the third element (`el`):
- If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
- If `el` is '.S.', then `team` is set to 1 and `points[team]` is set to 10.
- If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S.', then no changes are made to `allPlayers`, `team`, or `points`.

Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is set to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is `team_value` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings read from stdin, `time` is incremented by 1. If the length of `command` is 3, then `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` equals '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If the length of `command` is not 3, then `command` is updated to ('obj', 'com'), `time` is incremented by 1, `pos` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`, and if `obj` is a player and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true or `obj` is not a player but `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If the command is 'T' and the goalIn(pos) is not -1, then the team corresponding to the goal position has its points incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `time` is the previous value of `time` incremented by 1, `command` is an empty list, and `obj`, `com`, and `el` are undefined. If `len(comand) == 3`, then `obj` is either defined with `allPlayers[obj]` set to `True` if `el` equals '.Q', or `allPlayers[obj]` set to `False` and `points[team]` increased by 1 if `el` is not '.Q' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`. Otherwise, `obj` remains as it is if `isPlayer(obj)` is false and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is also false. `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is updated to `nxt`, and `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. If `com` is `'T'`, then `obj` is defined with `allPlayers[obj]` set to `False` and `points[team]` increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`. If `com` is not `'T'`, then `obj` remains unchanged, `pos` is updated to `nxt`, and if the player is identified, `pos` is further updated to `nxt`. Additionally, if `obj` is `.B`, then `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
