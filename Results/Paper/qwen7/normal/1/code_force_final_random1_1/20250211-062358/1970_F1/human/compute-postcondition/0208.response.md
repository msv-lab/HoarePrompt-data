Output State: **`command` is a list of strings, `comand` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `elements[obj]` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to be equal to `nxt`. Given that `nxt` is defined as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, the value of `elements[obj]` is now `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
