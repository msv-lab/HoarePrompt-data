Postcondition: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True else `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is `team_value` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**
