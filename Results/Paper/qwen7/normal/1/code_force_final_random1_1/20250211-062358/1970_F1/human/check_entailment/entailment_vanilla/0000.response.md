### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\) of the grid.
   - It initializes the grid and stores the positions of various entities like players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It sets up dictionaries and lists to keep track of the state of the game.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program processes commands for each step of the game.
   - It handles movements, catching, and throwing of the Quaffle correctly.
   - For each command, it updates the positions and states of the entities.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the program correctly increments the score for the opposing team and prints the appropriate message.
   - When a player scores in their own goal, the program correctly identifies this and prints the correct message.

4. **Elimination Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated if they try to catch the Quaffle from another player or throw it into their own goal.

5. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - After processing all commands, the program correctly prints the final score.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as invalid movements and scoring in the correct goal.
   - It ensures that the Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided input and expected output examples.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic for the game, including handling movements, scoring, and elimination of players.
