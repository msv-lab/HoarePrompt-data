Output State: **`ind` is 1; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `line[ind]` (where `ind` is 1) is 'B'. If it is 'B', `tmp` is assigned the value 0; otherwise, `tmp` is assigned the value 1. Since the exact value of `line[ind][0]` is not given, we express `tmp` in terms of the condition. The initial value of `ind` remains unchanged.
