Output State: **`time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `comand` is an empty list, `obj` is an undefined variable, `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`**.

This means that the `nxt` variable is calculated based on the current position (`pos`) and the movement direction (`mov[com][0]` and `mov[com][1]`). However, since `com` is undefined, the exact value of `nxt` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `pos` and `mov[com]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
