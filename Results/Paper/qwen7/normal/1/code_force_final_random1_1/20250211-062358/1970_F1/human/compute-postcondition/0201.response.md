Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`command` is a list of strings**: This is a list but its contents are not specified, so we don't need to worry about it for this particular print statement.

2. **`comand` is ('obj', 'com')**: This indicates that `comand` is a tuple with two elements: `'obj'` and `'com'`.

3. **`time` is `time` + 1**: This means `time` is incremented by 1. Let's denote the original value of `time` as `t`. After this operation, `time` becomes `t + 1`.

4. **`pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`**: This means `pos` is the value stored at the index `obj` in the `elements` list or dictionary.

5. **`nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**: Here, `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the second element is the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`.

6. **`player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`**: 
   - If `obj` is a player, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is the value at the position `nxt` in the `grid` list or dictionary.

Given these definitions, let's construct the print statement:

- `%d %s ELIMINATED`: This is a formatted string where `%d` is replaced by an integer and `%s` is replaced by a string.
- The integer part is `time`, which is `t + 1`.
- The string part is `player`.

So, the print statement will output something like:
"123 player ELIMINATED" (where `123` is `t + 1` and `player` is either `obj` if `obj` is a player, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`).

Output: **%d player ELIMINATED (where %d is time + 1 and player is determined based on the value of obj and grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
