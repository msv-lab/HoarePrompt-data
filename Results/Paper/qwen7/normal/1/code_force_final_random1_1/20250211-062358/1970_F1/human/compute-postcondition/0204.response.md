Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`command`**: A list of strings.
2. **`comand`**: A tuple with two elements, `('obj', 'com')`.
3. **`time`**: `time` + 1. Since `time` is not explicitly defined, let's assume it was `t` before this operation, so `time = t + 1`.
4. **`pos`**: The value of `elements[obj]`. Without knowing the specific value of `elements[obj]`, we cannot determine the exact coordinates, but we know it is a coordinate pair.
5. **`nxt`**: A tuple calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Here, `mov[com]` is a movement vector associated with the command `com` in the `mov` dictionary.
6. **`allPlayers[obj]`**: `False`. This indicates that player `obj` is not currently active.
7. **`team`**: The result of `goalIn(pos)`. This function returns a team identifier based on the position `pos`.

Given these details, the print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- **`time`**: This is `t + 1` where `t` is the previous value of `time`.
- **`team`**: This is the result of the `goalIn(pos)` function, which gives us the team identifier.
- **`GoalName[team]`**: This is the name of the team corresponding to the `team` identifier.

Therefore, the print statement will output the time and the name of the team that scored a goal.

Output: **(t + 1) GoalName[team] (where t is the previous value of time and team is the result of the goalIn(pos) function)**
