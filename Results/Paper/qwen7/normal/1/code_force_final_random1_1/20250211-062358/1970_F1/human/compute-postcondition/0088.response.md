Output State: **`ind` is `len(line)`, `i` is 1, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin` and updated to be the result of `stdin.readline().strip().split()`, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in the new `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in the new `line`**.

Explanation: The code reads a line from `stdin`, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings. This operation updates the `line` variable to the newly formed list. All other variables (`ind`, `i`, `n`, `grid`, `elements`) remain unchanged in terms of their types and relationships, but `line` now holds the split result.
