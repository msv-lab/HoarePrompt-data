Output State: **`i` is 0, `ind` is 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is updated to the list of strings read from `stdin`, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from `stdin`, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `line`. The values of `i`, `ind`, `n`, `grid`, `isPlayer(line[ind])`, and `goal` remain unchanged from their initial states.
