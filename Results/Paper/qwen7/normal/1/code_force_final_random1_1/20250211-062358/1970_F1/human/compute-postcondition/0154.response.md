Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` unpacks the list `command` into two variables `obj` and `com`. Since `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` will be assigned the first element of `command`, and `com` will be assigned the second element of `command`. The length of `command` is not equal to 3, so the third element (if it exists) is not assigned to any variable.
