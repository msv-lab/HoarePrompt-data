Postcondition: `time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `command` is an empty list, `obj` is either defined with `allPlayers[obj]` set to `False` and `points[team]` increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, or `obj` remains as it is if `isPlayer(obj)` is false and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is also false. `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is updated to `nxt`, and `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. If `com` is `'T'`, then `obj` is defined with `allPlayers[obj]` set to `False` and `points[team]` increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`. If `com` is not `'T'`, then `obj` remains unchanged, `pos` is updated to `nxt`, and if the player is identified, `pos` is further updated to `nxt`. Additionally, if `obj` is `.B`, then `elements[obj]` is now equal to `nxt`.
