Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element. `obj` is equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is True or `isPlayer(obj)` is True and `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`. If `isPlayer(obj)` is True, then `player` is `obj`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
