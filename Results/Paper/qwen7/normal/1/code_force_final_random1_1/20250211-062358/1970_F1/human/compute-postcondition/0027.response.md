Output State: **`i` is updated to `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G' and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(elements[line[len(line) - 1]], line[len(line) - 1])` to the list `goal`.**

Explanation: The code updates `elements[line[ind]]` to the tuple `(i, ind)`. This means that the value of `i` is stored as the first element of the tuple and the value of `ind` is stored as the second element of the tuple. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
