Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `time`: The previous value of `time` + 1. Since no previous value is mentioned, we assume `time` is set to 1 initially.
   - `command`: An empty list.
   - `team`: The value is 1.
   - `obj`, `com`, `el`: These are undefined, so their values are not relevant to the print statement.
   - `points[team]`: The value is 10. Since `team` is 1, `points[1]` is 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `time` is 1 (since it is the previous value of `time` + 1, and assuming `time` was 0 previously).
- `team` is 1.
- `points[1]` is 10, but this is not directly used in the print statement.

The print statement uses `time` and `GoalName[team]`. Since `GoalName` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact content. However, we can infer that `GoalName[team]` refers to the goal name associated with `team` 1.

Thus, the print statement will output:
Output: **1 GoalName[1] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
