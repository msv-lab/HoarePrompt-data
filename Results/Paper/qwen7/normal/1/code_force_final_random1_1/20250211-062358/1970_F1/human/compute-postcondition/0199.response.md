Output State: **`command` is a list of strings, `comand` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**.

This means that the variable `nxt` is now a tuple containing the updated position calculated by adding the movement values from `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
