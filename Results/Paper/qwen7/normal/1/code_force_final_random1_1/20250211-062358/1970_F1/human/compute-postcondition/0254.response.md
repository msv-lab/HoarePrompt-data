Based on the initial state provided, `points` is a list containing the final points of two players. The print statement uses the first and second elements of this list, which represent the points of the first and second player respectively.

Given the format of the print statement:
```
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

The output will be a string that includes the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]**
