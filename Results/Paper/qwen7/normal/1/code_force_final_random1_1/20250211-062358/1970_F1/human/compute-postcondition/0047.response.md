Output State: **`i` is 0, `ind` is 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is updated to the list of strings read from `stdin`, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.**

Explanation: The code `grid.append(line)` appends the list `line` to the existing list `grid`. Initially, `grid` contained only one element, which was the list `line`. After executing the code, `grid` now contains two elements: the original list and the newly appended list `line`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
