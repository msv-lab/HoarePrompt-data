Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis))`. The objects involved here are `j` and `lis`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1. This matches the starting condition of the range function.

3. **Determine the state of `lis`**: For the loop to execute, `lis` must have at least 2 elements because the range function `range(1, len(lis))` requires `len(lis)` to be at least 2 (since it starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `j` is initially set to 1 and `lis` has at least 2 elements.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `lis`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and `test` is True**
