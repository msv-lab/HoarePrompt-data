Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key to solving this problem lies in the Sprague-Grundy theorem, which states that the game can be reduced to a Nim game, where the Grundy number of a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable from it.

2. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - The function `func_1`:
     - Checks if the first element of the array is 1. If not, it returns 'Alice'.
     - Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique elements from the array.
     - Iterates through this list to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1.
     - Alternates the boolean `A` with each iteration.
     - Returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise returns 'Bob'.

3. **Analysis of Function Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the part where it checks for differences greater than 1 and alternates `A` is unnecessary and does not correctly implement the Sprague-Grundy theorem.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the XOR of the unique values in the sorted list, which gives the Grundy number for the Nim game equivalent.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should calculate the XOR of the unique values in the sorted list.
   - If the XOR result is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
