Postcondition: `not_c` is True, `A` is False, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This is because if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` becomes False and `i` remains 1, leading to breaking out of the loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `not_c` remains True, `A` remains False, and `i` remains 1, also resulting in breaking out of the loop or if statement.
