Output State: **`j` is 3, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with a length greater than 1, and `test` is `False`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables `j`, `lis`, and `test` remain unchanged from their initial states.
