The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It checks if the first element of `arr` is 1. If not, it returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`. It then iterates through this list to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1. If such a pair is found, it sets `not_c` to False. The variable `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration. Finally, based on the value of `A`, it returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns 'Alice'.
