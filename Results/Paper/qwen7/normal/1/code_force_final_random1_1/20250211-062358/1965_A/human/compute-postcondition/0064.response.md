Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and `test` is False, and if the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, then `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the difference is not greater than 1, `test` remains True.
