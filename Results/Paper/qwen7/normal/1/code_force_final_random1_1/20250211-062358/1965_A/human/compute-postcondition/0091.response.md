Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, and `test` is False, with the condition that if the length of `lis` is odd, `test` remains False; if the length of `lis` is even, `test` remains False.
