Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with a length greater than 1, and the difference between the first two elements of `lis` is either greater than 1, in which case `test` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or the difference is not greater than 1, in which case no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with a length greater than 1. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False. No changes are made to the variables if the difference is not greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with a length greater than 1, and `test` is `False` if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` remains `False`. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, `test` remains `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
