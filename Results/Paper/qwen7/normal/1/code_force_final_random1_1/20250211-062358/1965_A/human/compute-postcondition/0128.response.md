Output State: **`j` is 3, `test` is False**

The variable `j` retains its initial value of 3, and the variable `test` is explicitly set to `False`. The precondition that `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element remains unchanged, but since no operations are performed on `lis`, it is not included in the output state.
