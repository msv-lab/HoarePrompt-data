You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each integer in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, and the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `not_c` is False, `A` is True, `i` is 5.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met or the loop completes all iterations. Given that `not_c` becomes False after the first iteration when the condition is met, it remains False throughout the rest of the loop. The variable `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs from `i=1` to `i=len(set_)`, and we know the loop executed up to `i=3` in the given states, it will continue to the end. With `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 each iteration, after 4 more iterations (from 4 to 5), the loop will finish. Therefore, `A` will be True after the 5th iteration because it alternates and started as True.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: Postcondition: `not_c` is False, `A` is True, `i` is 5. If `not_c` is False, then `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration, starting from True, and `i` increments from 1 to 5. After 5 iterations, `A` is True and `i` is 5.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns 'Alice' in both cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
