Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(set_))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since the range starts from 1).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(set_)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial State of `set_`**: The `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`, starting from the first element which is 1. This means `set_` must contain at least one element (which is 1) for the loop to start.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `not_c` and `A` are not involved in the loop head, so their initial states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `set_` must contain at least two elements (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(set_) - 1`).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`not_c` is True, `A` is False, `i` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1, and `set_` must contain at least 2 elements**.
