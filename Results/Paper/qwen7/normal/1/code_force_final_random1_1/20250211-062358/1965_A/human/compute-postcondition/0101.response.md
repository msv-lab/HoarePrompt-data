Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `lis`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 1 (since `range(1, len(lis))` starts at 1).
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < len(lis)`.
   - Since `j` starts at 1, the loop will execute if `len(lis)` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `j` is set to 1 initially.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial states:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object created from integers split from the new input string.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.
- `test` is True.
- `n` is an input integer.

We only need to adjust the states of `j` and `lis` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
**`j` is 1, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is 1, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element**
