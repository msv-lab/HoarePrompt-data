Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element, and if the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than or equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change occurs to `j` or `lis`.
