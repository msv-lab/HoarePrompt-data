Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` and assigns it to `y`. If '1' is not found, `y` remains -1. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `z` remain unchanged.
