Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string); `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`, `n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input(''))` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
