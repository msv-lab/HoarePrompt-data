Output State: `t` must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `arr` is the string without spaces for each iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (or -1 if '1' is not found), `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (or -1 if '1' is not found), `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `n` and `arr` will be the values provided for the last iteration, `x` and `y` will be determined based on the last `arr`, and `z` will be the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
