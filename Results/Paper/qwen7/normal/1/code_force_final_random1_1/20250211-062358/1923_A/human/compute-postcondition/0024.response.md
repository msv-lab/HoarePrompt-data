Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) where each a_i is either 0 or 1. For each test case, the function checks if at least one cell contains a chip (indicated by 1). If at least one cell contains a chip, the function returns "at least one chip present"; otherwise, it returns "no chips present".**
