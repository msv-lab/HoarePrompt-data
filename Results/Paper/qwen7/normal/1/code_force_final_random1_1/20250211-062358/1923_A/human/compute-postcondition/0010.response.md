Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string); `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes an input string, splits it into a list of words, and then joins them back together without any spaces. This effectively removes all spaces from the input string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
