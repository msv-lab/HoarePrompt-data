Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`, `n` is updated to an input integer**.

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the other variables retain their original conditions and values unless explicitly changed by the subsequent code.
