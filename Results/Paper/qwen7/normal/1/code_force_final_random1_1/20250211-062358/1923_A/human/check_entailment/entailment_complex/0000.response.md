Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Substring Extraction**: The function extracts the substring `z` from `arr` using `z = arr[x:n - y]`. However, this approach does not ensure that `z` contains only the cells with chips and no free cells between them. Instead, it includes the cells from the first to the last chip, which might still contain free cells within the block of chips.

2. **Counting '0's**: The function counts the number of '0's in `z` using `z.count('0')`. This count represents the number of free cells within the block of chips, but the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all chips form a single block without any free cells between them.

3. **Operations Calculation**: To achieve the goal, we need to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips to the leftmost possible position. This involves moving each chip to the nearest free cell to its left until no more moves can be made.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve iterating through the array and counting how many chips are to the right of each chip, as each chip needs to be moved past all the chips to its right to form a single block.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
