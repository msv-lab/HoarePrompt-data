Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces.**

Explanation: The code takes an input string, splits it into a list of words using `split()`, and then joins these words back together into a single string using `join()` without any separator. This resulting string is assigned to the variable `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
