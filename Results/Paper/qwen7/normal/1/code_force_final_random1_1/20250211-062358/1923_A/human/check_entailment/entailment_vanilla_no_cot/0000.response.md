Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Minimum Operations**: The logic in the code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block. It instead counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not always the correct approach.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code fails to handle cases where chips are scattered in such a way that moving them directly to the leftmost cluster might require more operations than necessary.

3. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The code reads input with spaces split and joined back together, which is unnecessary and could lead to issues with multiple spaces or other characters.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to count the number of operations required to move all chips to the leftmost contiguous block. This involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost positions of chips and calculating the required moves.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the leftmost and rightmost positions of chips
        leftmost_chip = None
        rightmost_chip = None
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                if leftmost_chip is None:
                    leftmost_chip = i
                rightmost_chip = i
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = 0
        for i in range(leftmost_chip, rightmost_chip + 1):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                min_operations += 1
        
        print(min_operations)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the leftmost and rightmost positions of chips and calculates the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.
