Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` is equal to `k`.
   - If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - Each diagonal in an \( n \times n \) grid can be uniquely identified by its slope and starting point.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
   - To ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to find the minimum number of cells to color.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - When `4 * n - 2 == k`, each diagonal must have at least one colored cell.
     - In this case, the minimum number of cells needed is `k // 2 + 1`. This is because each cell can cover two diagonals (one from each direction).
   - When `4 * n - 2 != k`, we need to cover at least `k` diagonals.
     - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` ensures that we cover the required number of diagonals efficiently.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 \neq 4 \), we use `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 \neq 3 \), we use `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 == 10 \), we use \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \)
  - Output: `6`

- **Test Case 4:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 \neq 9 \), we use `ceil(9 / 2) = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 5:** \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \)
  - Since \( 14 \neq 7 \), we use `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`
  - Output: `4`

- **Test Case 6:** \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \)
  - Since \( 26 \neq 11 \), we use `ceil(11 / 2) = 6`
  - Output: `6`

- **Test Case 7:** \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \)
  - Since \( 6 \neq 3 \), we use `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
  - Output: `2`

All these outputs match the expected results.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to color based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
