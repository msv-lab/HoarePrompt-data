Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the next line from the input.
   - `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int.
   - `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int.
   - The variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`.
   - If `k > 4 * n - 4`, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(k / 2))
   ```

Given these details, let's determine the value of `k` and then compute `math.ceil(k / 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Swapping `n` and `k`:**
   - Suppose the input line `s` is "5 7". After splitting, `n` would be 5 and `k` would be 7. But since they swap roles, `n` becomes 7 and `k` becomes 5.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - We need to check if `k > 4 * n - 4`.
   - Substituting the values: `4 * n - 4 = 4 * 7 - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24`.
   - Since `k = 5` and `5 < 24`, the condition `k > 4 * n - 4` is not satisfied. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` do not change.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the swapping and checking the condition, `n` is 7 and `k` is 5.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Compute `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - `k / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5`.
   - `math.ceil(2.5) = 3`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the result of `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
