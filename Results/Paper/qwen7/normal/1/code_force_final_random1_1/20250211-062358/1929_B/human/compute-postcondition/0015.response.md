Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer input from the first split.
   - `k` is an integer input from the second split.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `4 * n - 2` does not equal `k`, the loop will continue to the next iteration.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - No changes are made to the states of `t`, `n`, or `k` unless `4 * n - 2` does not equal `k`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 (since it is decremented by 1 each iteration).
   - Since no changes are made to `n` or `k` unless `4 * n - 2` does not equal `k`, these values remain the same.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `k` is an integer input from the second split**.
