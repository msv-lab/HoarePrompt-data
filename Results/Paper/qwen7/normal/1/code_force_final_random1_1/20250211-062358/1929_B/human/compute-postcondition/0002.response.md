Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `_` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `_` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
