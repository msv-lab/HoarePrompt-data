Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more lines in the input. After all iterations, the following conditions hold:

- `s` is the last line from the input (if any).
- `n` and `k` are the last values obtained from splitting `s` and converting to integers, with the roles of `n` and `k` swapped depending on the order they were processed in the loop.
- If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the loop continues processing the next line.
- If `k == 4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.
- If `k > 4 * n - 4`, the loop terminates without further changes to `n` and `k`.

In summary, the final values of `n` and `k` depend on the last line of input processed, and the outputs generated during the loop are based on the specific conditions met by `k` relative to `4 * n - 4`.
