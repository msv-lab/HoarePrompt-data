Postcondition: **`s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and either `k == 4 * n - 3` in which case the variables `n` and `k` retain their swapped roles, or if `k == 4 * n - 2`, the variables `n` and `k` retain their swapped roles.**
