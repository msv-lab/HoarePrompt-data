Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `4 * n - 2` is not equal to `k`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(ceil(k / 2))` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of `k` by 2.
2. Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will result in either an integer or a floating-point number.
3. The `ceil` function will round this result up to the nearest integer if it's not already an integer.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact integer value of `ceil(k / 2)`. However, we know it will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
