The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, then checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0 and retains the values of `n` and `k` from the last test case, without further modification.
