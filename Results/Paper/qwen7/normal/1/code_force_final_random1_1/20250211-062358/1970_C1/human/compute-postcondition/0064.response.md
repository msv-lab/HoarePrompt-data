Output State: **`tree[current]` is not empty (excluding the previously processed `neighbor`), `visited` includes the previously processed `neighbor` and the new `neighbor` added by `visited.add(neighbor)`, and `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and possibly other tuples.**

Explanation: The line `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. This means that the `neighbor` is now included in the `visited` set. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
