Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` will be less than or equal to 0; `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration; `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration; `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations; `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations; `tmp` is equal to `z`; `one` is set to True.**

The variable `one` is now set to `True`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
