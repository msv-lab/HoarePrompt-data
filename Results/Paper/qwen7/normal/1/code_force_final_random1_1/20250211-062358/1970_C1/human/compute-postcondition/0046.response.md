Output State: The queue contains tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, with `dist` being the distance from the original `current` node. The `current` variable is set to the next unvisited neighbor of the original `current` node in the tree, and `dist` is incremented by 1 for each step. The `visited` set includes all nodes that have been processed so far. The loop continues until all reachable nodes from the original `current` node have been visited, and `queue` becomes empty.

In simpler terms, the queue will contain all the unvisited neighbors of the current node along with their respective distances from the starting node, sorted in the order they were discovered. The `current` node will be the last node that was added to the `queue`, and `dist` will be the distance from the start to this node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been explored during the traversal.
