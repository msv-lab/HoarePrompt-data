Output State: **`one` is True, `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `lst[tmp]`, `x` will be less than or equal to 0 after all iterations, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations, `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations.**

Explanation: The variable `one` was initially set to `False`. The line `one = not one` changes its value to `True`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
