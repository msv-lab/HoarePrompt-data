Output State: The `queue` will contain tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, with the `dist` value incremented by 1 for each level deeper into the tree. The `current` variable will be the last node added to the `queue` during the final iteration of the loop, and `dist` will be the distance from the original starting node to this `current` node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been processed and added to the `queue`. The loop continues until all reachable nodes from the starting node have been explored, and the `queue` is empty.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will contain all nodes reachable from the starting node, along with their respective distances from the start. The `current` and `dist` variables will reflect the last node and its distance processed before the loop terminates, and `visited` will include all nodes that were part of the traversal.
