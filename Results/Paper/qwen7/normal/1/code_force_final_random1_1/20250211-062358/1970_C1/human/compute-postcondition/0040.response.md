Output State: **`one` is True, `two` is False, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` after it was popped.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` pops (removes and returns) the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. The other variables (`one` and `two`) remain unchanged. The state of `rev[tmp]` is updated to remove its last element.
