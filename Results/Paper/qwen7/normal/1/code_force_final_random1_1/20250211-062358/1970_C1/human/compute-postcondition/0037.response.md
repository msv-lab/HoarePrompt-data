Output State: **`one` is True, `two` is True, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[rev[tmp]]`**

Explanation: The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` pops (removes and returns) the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. Since `tmp` was not the last element of `rev[z]` initially, it now becomes the last element of `rev[rev[tmp]]`. The values of `one` and `two` remain unchanged.
