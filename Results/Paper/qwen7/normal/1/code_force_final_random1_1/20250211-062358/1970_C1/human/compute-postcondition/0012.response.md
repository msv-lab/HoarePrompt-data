Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the elements `a` appended to it, `lst[a]` now contains the element `b`, `a` is updated to a new integer value from input, `b` is updated to a new integer value from input**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not affect the value of `x`, `rev[b]`, or `lst[a]` directly but updates the values of `a` and `b` to new integer values from the input. Therefore, the updated values of `a` and `b` are used in the subsequent operations, while the conditions and assignments related to `x`, `rev[b]`, and `lst[a]` remain as described in the initial state.
