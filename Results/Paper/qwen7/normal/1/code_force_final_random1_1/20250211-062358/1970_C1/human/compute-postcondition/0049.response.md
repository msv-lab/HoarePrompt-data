Output State: **The `queue` now contains tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` excluding the tuple that was removed (which had `current` as its neighbor and `dist + 1` as its distance), `current` is the node that was dequeued from the `queue`, and `dist` is the distance from the original starting node to this `current` node. The `visited` set remains unchanged, including all nodes that have been processed and added to the `queue`.**

This means the `queue` has been updated by removing the tuple that included the `current` node and its distance (`dist + 1`). The `current` and `dist` variables now hold the node and its distance from the start node that were dequeued from the `queue`. The `visited` set remains the same as before the operation.
