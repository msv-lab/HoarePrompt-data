Output State: **`one` is True, `two` is False, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` after popping it.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` pops (removes and returns) the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. The other variables (`one`, `two`, and `rev[z]`) remain unchanged.
