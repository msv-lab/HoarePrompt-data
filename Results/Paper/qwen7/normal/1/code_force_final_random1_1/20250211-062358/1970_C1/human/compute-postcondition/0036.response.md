Output State: **`one` is True, `two` is True, `tmp` is not the last element of `rev[z]`**

Explanation: The variable `two` is initially set to `False`. The line `two = not two` changes the value of `two` to the opposite of its current value, which means `two` becomes `True`. The values of `one` and `tmp` remain unchanged.
