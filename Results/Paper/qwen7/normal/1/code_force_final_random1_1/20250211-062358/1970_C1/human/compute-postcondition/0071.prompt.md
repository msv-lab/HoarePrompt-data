Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `queue` is a deque containing tuples representing nodes and their distances from the start node, starting from the second element of the original `queue`. The `current` is the first element of the final `queue`, which is a tuple of the form (`node`, `distance`). The `dist` is the distance from the start node to the `current` node. The set `visited` contains all the nodes that have been visited during the entire execution of the loop, including the start node and all nodes reachable from it through the shortest path.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will contain all nodes that can be reached from the start node, each paired with its shortest distance from the start node. The `current` will be the last node processed, and `dist` will represent the shortest distance to this node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been explored, ensuring no node is processed more than once.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: The `queue` will contain tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, with the `dist` value incremented by 1 for each level deeper into the tree. The `current` variable will be the last node added to the `queue` during the final iteration of the loop, and `dist` will be the distance from the original starting node to this `current` node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been processed and added to the `queue`. The loop continues until all reachable nodes from the starting node have been explored, and the `queue` is empty.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will contain all nodes reachable from the starting node, along with their respective distances from the start. The `current` and `dist` variables will reflect the last node and its distance processed before the loop terminates, and `visited` will include all nodes that were part of the traversal.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: All nodes in the tree that are reachable from the starting node have been visited, and their distances from the starting node are stored in the `queue`. Specifically, each element in the `queue` is a tuple containing a node and its distance from the starting node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been processed, ensuring no node is visited more than once.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, every node in the subtree rooted at the starting node has been explored, and the `queue` contains the distance information for all these nodes. The `visited` set is complete, indicating that no node was revisited during the traversal.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
