Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `x` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variables `a` and `b` with their respective values being the integers input by the user.
