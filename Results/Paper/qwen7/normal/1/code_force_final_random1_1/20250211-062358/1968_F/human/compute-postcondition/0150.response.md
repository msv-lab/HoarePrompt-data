Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`, and if `x == 0`, `results` is appended with 'YES' and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
