Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` (or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep the list sorted) - 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `it2` by finding the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using `bisect.bisect_left` and subtracting 1. This does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `results`, `v1`, or `v2`. The value of `it2` depends on the contents of `v2` and the position of `r` within it.
