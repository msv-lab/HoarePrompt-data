The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, we assume this statement is within a loop. The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`**
