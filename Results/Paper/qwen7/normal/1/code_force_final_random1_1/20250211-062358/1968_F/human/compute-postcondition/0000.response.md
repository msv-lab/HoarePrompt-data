Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
