Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO' if the condition fails for any query, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` and `it2` are the results of `bisect.bisect_left` operations based on the final values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` respectively.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and the `idx` variable has been incremented by 2 for each iteration, totaling `2 * q` increments. Therefore, `idx` is now equal to the initial value of `6 + n` plus the total number of elements in the list `a`, which is `n + 1`. The `results` list contains the outcomes of all `q` queries, each determined by the conditions within the loop. The `pf` list contains the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `a`, and the `mp` dictionary maps the final `pf` value to the list `[n + 1]`.
