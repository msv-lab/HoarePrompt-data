Output State: **`idx` is 8, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[3]` is either `pf[2] ^ a[3]` added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, or `pf[3]` remains unchanged, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `a[4]` is `int(data[idx])`**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 7, so after executing this line, `idx` becomes 8. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
