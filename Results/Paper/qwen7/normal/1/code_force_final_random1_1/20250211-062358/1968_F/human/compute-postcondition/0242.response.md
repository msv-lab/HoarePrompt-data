Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is updated to the list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is retrieved again from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the element in `v1` which is just greater than or equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The code performs a binary search using `bisect.bisect_left` to find the position in `v1` where the element `l` would fit in a sorted order. This does not change the values of `q`, `idx`, `v2`, `it2`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, and `pf`. The only new information is the value of `it1`, which is the index found by the binary search.
