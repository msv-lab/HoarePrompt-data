Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO' if the condition fails for any query, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `results` is now appended with an empty string, `it1` and `it2` are the results of `bisect.bisect_left` operations based on the final values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `results` list has had an empty string appended to it, `idx` now points to the position right after the last processed element in `data`, `total`, `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged with their initial values, the `a` array and `pf` array have been updated to include the cumulative XOR results of all elements processed so far, and the `mp` dictionary contains the indices where each cumulative XOR result occurs in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a non-negative integer (since it decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `idx` is equal to its initial value plus 24 times the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop, `l` and `r` are the last values assigned within the loop, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` are lists retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively, and `it1` and `it2` are indices used to check the conditions for appending 'YES' or 'NO' to `results`; `results` now has an empty string appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
