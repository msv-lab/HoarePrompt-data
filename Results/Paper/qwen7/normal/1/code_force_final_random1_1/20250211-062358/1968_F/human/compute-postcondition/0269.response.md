Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t, followed by arrays n and q, and an array a. For each test case, it handles q queries, each defined by indices l and r. It calculates the result for each query based on the XOR values of the subarray from index l to r, and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. Finally, it prints the results list, which contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.**
