Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`.
- `idx` is increased by 10.
- `v1` is updated to the list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
- `v2` is retrieved again from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
- `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`.
- `results` contains 'YES'.
- `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`.
- `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`.
- `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
- `it1` is the index of the element in `v1` which is just greater than or equal to `l`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition for the `for _ in range(q):` is simply `q > 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `q` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `q` must be greater than 0. Thus, `q` should be set to `q - 1` plus 1, meaning `q` should be set to `q`.
- `idx` is increased by 10, so it should be increased by 10 again.
- `v1` and `v2` are updated based on the current values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, respectively. These updates happen inside the loop body, so we don't need to change them here.
- `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`. This value is determined by the current state of `v2` and `r`, so it doesn't need to be changed.
- `results` contains 'YES' initially, but its content may change based on the conditions inside the loop. We cannot predict its exact content without running the loop body, but we know it could potentially contain 'NO' if the conditions are not met.
- `l` and `r` are reassigned based on the updated `idx`, so they should be reassigned again.
- `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, which will be recalculated inside the loop body.
- `it1` is the index of the element in `v1` which is just greater than or equal to `l`. This value is determined by the current state of `v1` and `l`, so it doesn't need to be changed.

### Final States:
- `q` remains the same (greater than 0).
- `idx` is increased by 10.
- `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`.
- `r` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`.

### Updated State:
State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 20, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`**
