Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` (or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep the list sorted) - 1.**
