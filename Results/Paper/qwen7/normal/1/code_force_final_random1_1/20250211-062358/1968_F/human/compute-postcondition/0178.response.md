Output State: **`n` is the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `q` is the value of `data[idx + 1]` converted to an integer. All other variables (`total`, `t`, `results`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `q = int(data[idx + 1])` assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `q`. The initial state tells us that `n` is assigned the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer and `idx` is incremented by 1. Since no other changes are made to the variables `total`, `t`, `results`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`, their states remain unchanged.
