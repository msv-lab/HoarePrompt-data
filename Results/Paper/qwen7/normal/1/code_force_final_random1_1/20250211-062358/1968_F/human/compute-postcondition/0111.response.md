Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` creates an empty list for the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
