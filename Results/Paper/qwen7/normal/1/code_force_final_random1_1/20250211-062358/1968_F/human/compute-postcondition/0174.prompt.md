Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is the final value it was updated to during the last iteration of the loop, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus the number of elements in `data` from `data[idx]` to the end, `a[i]` is the last element of `data` processed, `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR result of all elements in `a` up to `a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the indices where `pf[i]` occurs in `a`, `i` is `n + 1`.

This output state describes the final conditions of all variables after the loop has completed its iterations. The loop processes each element of `data` starting from `data[idx]` and updates the arrays `a` and `pf`, as well as the dictionary `mp`, based on the XOR operation. The variable `idx` is incremented appropriately to ensure that each new element of `data` is correctly processed. The variables `total`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`; if the conditions `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` are met, `results` list contains 'YES', otherwise `results` list contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `v1` is the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` (or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep the list sorted) - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
