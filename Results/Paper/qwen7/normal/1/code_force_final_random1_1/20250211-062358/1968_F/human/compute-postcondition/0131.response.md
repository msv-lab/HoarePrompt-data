Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the current value of `x` is 0; `results` list has 'YES' appended to it; we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No changes are made to the variables, and the loop continues as if the current iteration was skipped.
