Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 2, `total` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros, and `mp` remains unchanged.**

The code initializes `pf` as a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros. This changes the value of `pf` from its previous state to a new list of zeros with the specified length. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
