Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, the results list remains unchanged if x equals 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` retrieves a value from the dictionary `mp` using the key `pf[r]`. If the key exists, `v1` will be assigned the corresponding value; if the key does not exist, `v1` will be assigned an empty list `[]`. The values of `q`, `idx`, and the `results` list remain unchanged unless `x` is 0, in which case the `results` list would be appended with 'YES', but since the condition is not met (no changes are made), the `results` list remains unchanged.
