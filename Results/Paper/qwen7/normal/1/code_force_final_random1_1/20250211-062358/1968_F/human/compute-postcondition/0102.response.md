Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is equal to `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n - 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 1, `x` is not defined, `v1` is not defined, `v2` is not defined, `results` is now appended with an empty string, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`**

Explanation:
- The code updates `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `pf[n - 1]` is set to `pf[n - 2] ^ a[n - 1]`.
- `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, which means `n` changes to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `idx` is incremented by 2, so `idx` becomes the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 1, plus 2.
- `a[i]` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, which means `a[n - 1]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
