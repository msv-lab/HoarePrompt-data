Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the index `it2` using `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, which finds the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
