Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is equal to `int(data[idx + 1])`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n - 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 1, `x` is not defined, `v1` is not defined, `v2` is not defined, `results` is now appended with an empty string, `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since the initial value of `idx` was the sum of the initial value and the total number of elements in the list `a`, the new value of `idx` is the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
