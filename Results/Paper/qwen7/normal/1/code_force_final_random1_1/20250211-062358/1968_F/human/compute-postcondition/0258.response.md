Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has 'YES' appended to it if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `it1` to be the index of the leftmost position where `l` can be inserted into the sorted list `v1` without violating the order. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
