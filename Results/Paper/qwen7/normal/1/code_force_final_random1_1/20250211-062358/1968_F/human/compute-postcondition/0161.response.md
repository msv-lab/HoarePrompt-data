Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2.**

The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. The other variables (`q`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
