Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is updated to the list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is retrieved again from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the element in `v1` which is just greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially containing `'YES'`, after this operation, it will contain two `'YES'` elements.
- All other variables (`q`, `idx`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `it1`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
