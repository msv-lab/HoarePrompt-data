Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `v1` is the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the index `it2` which is the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in the list `v2`. This is done using the `bisect.bisect_left` function, which returns the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order. Since `v2` is a list, `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r)` gives the index of the first element in `v2` that is greater than or equal to `r`. Subtracting 1 from this index gives `it2`, which is the index just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
