Postcondition: `q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` either has 'YES' or 'NO' appended to it, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in the sorted list `v2` minus 1. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.
