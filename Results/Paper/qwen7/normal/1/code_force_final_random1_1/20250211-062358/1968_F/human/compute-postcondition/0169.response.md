Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` (or the position where `l` would be inserted to keep the list sorted).**

Explanation: The code performs a binary search using `bisect.bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `l` in the list `v1`. This insertion point is stored in `it1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
