The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. This means that the values of the variables that were about to be updated or checked will not change. Therefore, the values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the current iteration.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`, `results` is appended with 'YES', and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
