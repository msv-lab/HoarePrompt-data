Output State: **`q` must be a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer from `data[idx + 1]`; idx is increased by 2.**

The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `idx` by 2.
