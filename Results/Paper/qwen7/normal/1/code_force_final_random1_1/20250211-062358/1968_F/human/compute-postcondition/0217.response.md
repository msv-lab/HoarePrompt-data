Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `x` is equal to 0, `results` list has been appended with 'YES' and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `q`, `idx`, `x`, and the contents of the `results` list remain unchanged.
