Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is ['YES'], `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` calculates the position in the sorted list `v1` where the value `l` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. However, since the exact values of `v1` and `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `it1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
