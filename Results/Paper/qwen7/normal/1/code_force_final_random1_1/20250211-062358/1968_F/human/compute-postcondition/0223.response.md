Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`.**

Explanation: The code `it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` calculates the index of the first position in `v2` where a value greater than or equal to `r` would be inserted, and then subtracts 1 to get the index of the element just less than `r`. The values of `q`, `idx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
