Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` and `v1` is updated to the list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is retrieved again from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.**

Explanation: The code retrieves the list `v2` from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` again, but since the retrieval does not modify the value of `v2`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables are as described in the initial state.
