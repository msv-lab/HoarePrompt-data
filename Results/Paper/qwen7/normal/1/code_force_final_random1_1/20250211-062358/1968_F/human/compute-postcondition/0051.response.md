Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is ['YES'], `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.**

Explanation: The code retrieves two values from the dictionary `mp`: `v1` is the value associated with the key `pf[r]` (or an empty list if the key does not exist), and `v2` is the value associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` (or an empty list if the key does not exist). No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
