Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now contains 'YES', and the conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` still hold true, and both `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` are satisfied.**

The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list, which was previously defined under the precondition. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
