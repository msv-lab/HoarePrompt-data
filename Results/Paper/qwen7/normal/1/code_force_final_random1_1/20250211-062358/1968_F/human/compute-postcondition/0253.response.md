The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the variables `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous states. The `continue` statement does not modify any variables or change the state of the program outside of the loop context.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list with 'YES' appended to it.**
