Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` now contains 'NO'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `idx`, `v1`, `v2`, or `it2`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that `results` now includes the string `'NO'`.
