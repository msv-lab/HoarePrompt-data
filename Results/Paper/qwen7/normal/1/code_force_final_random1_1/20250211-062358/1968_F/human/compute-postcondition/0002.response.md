Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from `data[idx]` to `t`. Since `idx` was initially 0, it now becomes 1 after accessing `data[idx]` (which is `data[0]`). The value of `t` is set to the integer found at `data[0]`, and the `data` list remains unchanged except for the fact that `idx` has moved to the next element.
