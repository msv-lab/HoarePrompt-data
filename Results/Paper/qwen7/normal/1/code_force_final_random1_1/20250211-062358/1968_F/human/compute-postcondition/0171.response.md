Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' appended; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` (or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep the list sorted) - 1.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, or `it2`. It only adds `'YES'` to the existing list `results`. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged, and only `results` now contains `'YES'` in addition to whatever was already there.
