Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` becomes `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `a[i]` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`**.

This output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet. The variable `pf[i]` is updated to be the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
