Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` becomes `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `a[i]` is updated to `int(data[idx])`.**

Explanation:
- `a[i]` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx])`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` was previously set to `int(data[idx])`, `i` is also `n`. Thus, `a[i]` (or `a[n]`) is updated to `int(data[idx])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
