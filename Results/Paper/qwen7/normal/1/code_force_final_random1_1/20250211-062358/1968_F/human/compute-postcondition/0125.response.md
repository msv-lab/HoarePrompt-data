Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. Since `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]` are assumed to contain integer values, `r` will also be an integer. The conditions and values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged.
