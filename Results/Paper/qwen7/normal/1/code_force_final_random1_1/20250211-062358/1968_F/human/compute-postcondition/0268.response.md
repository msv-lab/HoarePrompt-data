Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), arrays n and q (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers (where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}). For each query defined by l and r (where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), the function performs operations based on the given range and returns results accordingly.**

This means the function processes multiple inputs indirectly through variables like t, n, q, and a, and for each query defined by l and r within the specified range, it performs some operations and returns the results.
