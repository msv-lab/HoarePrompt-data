Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `a[i]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation, and neither are any other variables mentioned. The only change is that `a[i]` is now set to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
