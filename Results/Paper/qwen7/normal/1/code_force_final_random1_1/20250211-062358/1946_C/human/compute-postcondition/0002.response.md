Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(sys.stdin.readline()))`. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the integer value read from standard input.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `solve()` has been called.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the integer value read from standard input is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the integer value read from standard input, we need to consider what happens after one iteration.
   - After reading the integer value from standard input, the loop will check if this value is greater than 0 to decide whether to continue or stop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the integer value read from standard input must be greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `t` will be updated to the new integer value read from standard input.
   - `solve()` will be called again in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (updated to the new value read from standard input).
- `solve()` has been called.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `solve()` has been called**.
