Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 10^4\).

Explanation: Given that `t` starts within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and with each iteration of the loop, `t` is decremented by 1, after all iterations of the loop, `t` will be less than 0 but since `t` cannot be negative, it will be 0. Therefore, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0.
