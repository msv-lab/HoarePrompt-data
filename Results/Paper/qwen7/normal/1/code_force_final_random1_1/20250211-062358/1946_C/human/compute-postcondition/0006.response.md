Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 10^4\).

Explanation: Given that `t` starts within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and with each iteration of the loop, `t` is decremented by 1, after all iterations of the loop, `t` will be a non-negative integer less than \(10^4\). Since the loop runs exactly `t` times, once `t` reaches 0, the loop will terminate. Therefore, the final value of `t` will be 0.
