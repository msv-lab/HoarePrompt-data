Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. The length of a and x is n, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. The values in x are sorted in ascending order and are non-zero, with -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n for all i.
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        
        rest = k
        
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        
        distance += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `distance` is equal to the maximum value found in the list `x` plus 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `rest` is 0, and all values in the list `a` indexed by `sorted_indices` are reduced to 0 or remain unchanged based on the deductions made during the loop iterations.
    #
    #This output state is derived from the understanding that the loop continues to increment `distance` until all elements in the list `a` indexed by `sorted_indices` are reduced to 0. The variable `pos` reaches the end of `sorted_indices` once all elements have been processed. The `rest` variable starts fresh at the beginning of each outer loop iteration but is eventually reduced to 0 as it is used to decrement the values in `a`. The `distance` variable increases with each full cycle of the outer loop, stopping when the condition to exit the loop is met.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer minus the total number of iterations executed, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `k` is an input integer for each iteration, `a` is a list of integers updated with new input values split by spaces and converted to integers for each iteration, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())` for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. For each iteration, `n` and `k` will be the values entered by the user, `a` will be updated with the new list of integers entered by the user, and `x` will also be updated with the new list of integers entered by the user.
