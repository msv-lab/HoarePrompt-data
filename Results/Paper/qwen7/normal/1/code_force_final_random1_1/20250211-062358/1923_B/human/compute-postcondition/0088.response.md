Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - 2*delta) - delta, `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` is increased by 1; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `rest` is calculated using the updated `pos` value, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is further reduced by `delta`.
