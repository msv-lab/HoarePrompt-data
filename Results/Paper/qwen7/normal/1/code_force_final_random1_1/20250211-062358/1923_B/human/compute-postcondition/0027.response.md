Output State: **`delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - delta`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. The value of `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, so `rest` is reduced by this value. The other variables (`distance`, `pos`, `len(sorted_indices)`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
