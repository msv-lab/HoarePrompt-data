Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple monsters can be killed in a single second. According to the problem description, during each second, you can fire up to `k` bullets, and each bullet can target any monster, decreasing its health by 1. However, the solution in `func_1` does not account for the possibility of killing multiple monsters in a single second if they are within the range of the bullets fired.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```
In this case, the solution would fail because it does not consider firing both bullets at the 3rd monster in the first second, which would immediately kill it. Instead, it fires one bullet at the 1st monster and one at the 3rd monster, but does not check if both can be killed in the same second.

To fix this, the solution needs to ensure that if multiple monsters can be killed in a single second, it accounts for that by reducing their health by the appropriate amount of bullets fired.
