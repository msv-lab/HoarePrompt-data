Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
