The loop condition is `pos != len(sorted_indices)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `pos` must be different from `len(sorted_indices)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, and `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be different from `len(sorted_indices)`. This can be achieved by decrementing `pos` by 1, making it `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)` - 1, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`; `rest` is 0, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0.**
