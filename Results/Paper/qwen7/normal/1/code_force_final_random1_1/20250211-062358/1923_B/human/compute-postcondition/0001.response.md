Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable mentioned here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. This means `t` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for _ in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. If `t` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. The initial state of `t` being an integer input from the user does not guarantee that `t` is positive. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
