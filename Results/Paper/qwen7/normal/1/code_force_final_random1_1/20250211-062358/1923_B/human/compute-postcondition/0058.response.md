Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `distance` is 2, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is decreased by `delta`, `pos` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. The values of `delta`, `distance`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `rest` remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, `delta` remains as the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `distance` becomes 2 (initially 1, now incremented by 1), and `pos` is increased by 1.
