Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is updated with new input values split by spaces and converted to integers, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and the previous state of `x` remain unchanged, but `x` is now updated with the new input values.
