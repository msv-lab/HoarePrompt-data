Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces and converted to integers, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split()) and `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
