Output State: **`distance` is 4, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`), and `rest` is 0.**

Explanation: The initial state is given as follows:
- `distance` is 3
- `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined
- `rest` is 0

The code snippet is:
```python
distance += 1
```

This line increments the value of `distance` by 1. Given that `distance` was initially 3, after executing this line, `distance` becomes 4.

The other variables (`pos`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `rest`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `distance` is 4
- `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`)
- `rest` is 0
