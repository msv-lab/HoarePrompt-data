Output State: `distance` is the highest value it reached during the loop execution, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `rest` is 0, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`). All elements in `a[sorted_indices]` have been reduced to 0, and `distance` has been incremented for each full cycle through the inner while loop until all elements are zero or the end of `sorted_indices` is reached.

This means that the loop continues to increment `distance` and process elements in `a[sorted_indices]` until no more elements can be reduced, at which point `pos` equals `len(sorted_indices)` and `rest` is 0.
