Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):`. This means the loop continues as long as `rest` is not zero and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta - delta) - delta
   - `distance` remains unchanged
   - `pos` is one more than its original value

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the `while` statement must be true:
     - `rest != 0`
     - `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **`rest`**: Since `rest` is defined in terms of `k`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `delta`, and `pos`, and we know `rest` is not zero at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustment is necessary here because the condition `rest != 0` is already satisfied.
   - **`pos`**: We know `pos` is one more than its original value. To satisfy the condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. Therefore, `pos` should be set to a value that is less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `rest` remains as it is since it is not zero.
   - `distance` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` must be set to a value that is less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

Given this reasoning, the final state for the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta - delta) - delta, `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**
