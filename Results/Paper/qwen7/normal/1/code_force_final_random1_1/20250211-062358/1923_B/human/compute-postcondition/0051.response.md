Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is pos + 1, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `pos` by 1. The other variables (`distance`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `rest`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Therefore, `pos` is now `pos + 1`.
