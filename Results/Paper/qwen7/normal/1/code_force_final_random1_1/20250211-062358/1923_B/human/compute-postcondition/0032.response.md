Output State: `distance` is 0, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`; `rest` is 0, and all elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `pos` will be equal to `len(sorted_indices)` because the loop increments `pos` each time `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` reaches 0. The loop continues as long as `rest` is not 0 and `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`. Once `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` equals `len(sorted_indices)`, the loop terminates. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `rest` will be 0, and all elements in `a[sorted_indices]` will have been reduced to 0 due to the decrement operations within the loop.
