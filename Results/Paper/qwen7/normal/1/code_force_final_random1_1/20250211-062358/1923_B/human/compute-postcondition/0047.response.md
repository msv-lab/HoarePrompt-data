To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
- `rest != 0`
- `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

### Current State
- `distance` is 1
- `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)` (after incrementing `pos` by 1)
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`)
- `rest` is `k` - `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` - `delta` (since `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined, this part remains unchanged)

### Analysis
1. **Condition `rest != 0`:**
   - The value of `rest` is dependent on `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, which is currently undefined. Therefore, we cannot directly adjust `rest` based on the current information.

2. **Condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`:**
   - Currently, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)`, which means the loop condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)` is already false. To make the loop continue, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Adjustments Needed
- Since `pos` is currently `len(sorted_indices)`, to satisfy the condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `pos` to be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Final Answer
State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**
