Output State: `distance` is 0, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`; `rest` is 0, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `rest` will be reduced to 0 because it keeps decreasing by the value of `delta` in each iteration until there is nothing left to subtract. The variable `pos` will be equal to `len(sorted_indices)` because the loop increments `pos` by 1 each time `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` reaches 0. At this point, since `pos` equals `len(sorted_indices)`, the condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)` in the while loop becomes false, causing the loop to terminate. Additionally, `distance` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
