Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - 2*delta) - delta, `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `rest` is updated by subtracting `delta` from its current value. The new value of `rest` is calculated as `k - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - 2*delta) - delta`. The value of `delta` is recalculated as `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, which means `delta` takes the minimum value between `rest - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The values of `distance` and `pos` remain unchanged.
