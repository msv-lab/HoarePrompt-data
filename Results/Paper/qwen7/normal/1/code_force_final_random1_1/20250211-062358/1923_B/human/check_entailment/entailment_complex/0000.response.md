Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), and `k` (number of bullets per second).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the player's starting position.
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters, moving from the closest to the farthest.
   - The function returns `True` if all monsters can be killed before any of them reach the player, and `False` otherwise.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.
   - It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if the player can survive.
   - It prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise.
   
3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and constraints.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the player can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player.
   - The program iterates through all test cases and prints the correct result for each one.
   
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
