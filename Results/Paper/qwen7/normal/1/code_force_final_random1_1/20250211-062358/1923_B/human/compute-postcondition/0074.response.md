Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`) - `delta`, `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` is increased by 1, and `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, but the values of `rest`, `distance`, `x[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and the current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (which is 0) remain unchanged.
