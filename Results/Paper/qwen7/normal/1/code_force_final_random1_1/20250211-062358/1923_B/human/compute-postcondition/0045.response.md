Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)` (since `pos += 1` increments `pos` by 1, and `pos` was originally `len(sorted_indices) - 1`), `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`), `rest` is `k` - `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` - `delta` (since `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined, this part remains unchanged).**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `len(sorted_indices) - 1` to `len(sorted_indices)`. Since `pos` now points to an index beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes undefined. All other variables retain their original relationships or values.
