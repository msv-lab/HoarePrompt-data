Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).**

The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other operations are performed on `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
