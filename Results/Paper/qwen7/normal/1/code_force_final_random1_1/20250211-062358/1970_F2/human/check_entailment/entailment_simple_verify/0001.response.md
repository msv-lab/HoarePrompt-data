### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial position of the Quaffle and the goals.
   - The movements dictionary maps directions to their corresponding changes in coordinates.

2. **Game Loop**:
   - The program iterates through each move in the game.
   - For each move, it checks whether the entity is a Bludger or a player.
     - If the entity is a Bludger, it updates its position and checks for collisions with players.
       - If a collision occurs, the player is eliminated, and the program handles the elimination correctly.
       - The program correctly removes the eliminated player from the dictionary and prints the appropriate message.
     - If the entity is a player, it updates the player's position based on the direction specified.
       - The program correctly updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
     - The program correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.
       - When a player catches the Quaffle, the program updates the Quaffle's position to the player's current position.
       - When a player throws the Quaffle, the program updates the Quaffle's position to the player's current position and clears the player's possession.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into a goal, the program correctly updates the score and prints the appropriate message.
     - If the player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the program correctly prints "BLUE GOAL" or "RED GOAL" and updates the score.
     - If the player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the program correctly prints "RED GOAL" or "BLUE GOAL" and updates the score.
   - When a player is eliminated, the program prints the correct message and removes the player from the dictionary.
     - The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing them, ensuring the output is in the correct order.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After the game ends, the program prints the final score correctly.
     - The program correctly prints the final score in the format "FINAL SCORE: r b", where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the new position of an entity based on the direction provided.
     - The function correctly returns the updated coordinates by adding the direction vector to the current position.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and the annotated code, the program appears to handle all the necessary cases, including scoring, eliminating players, and updating the Quaffle's position. The program correctly processes each move, updates the state of the game, and prints the appropriate messages.

Given the above analysis, the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all the necessary cases.

**Final: True**
