Reasoning:

1. **Field Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field by parsing the input and storing the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger. The `players` dictionary and `goals` dictionary are used appropriately to store these positions.

2. **Movement and Elimination Logic**: The program handles the movement of players and the Bludger correctly. When a player and a Bludger occupy the same cell, the player is eliminated, and the program prints the appropriate message. The elimination logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that players are removed from the `players` dictionary and the correct messages are printed.

3. **Quaffle Handling**: The program correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle. When a player catches the Quaffle, the `quidditch` list is updated to reflect the new state. When a player throws the Quaffle, the `quidditch` list is updated accordingly. The program checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal and updates the scores and the field state correctly.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly identifies when a player scores in the opponent's goal and updates the scores. The final score is printed at the end of the game.

5. **Final Score Output**: The program outputs the final score in the correct format, including the score of both teams.

6. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity given its current position and the direction of movement. The function is used consistently throughout the program.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the rules and logic of the game correctly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
