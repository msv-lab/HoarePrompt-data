Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the new position of an entity on the field based on the direction (`b`). However, the function's implementation seems to be incorrect. It returns the original coordinates `x` and `y` instead of the updated coordinates after applying the direction `dx` and `dy`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The program processes each step of the game correctly, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the given commands.
   - The logic for handling eliminations and scoring points appears to be correct. Players are eliminated if they collide with a Bludger, and points are awarded when a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal.
   - The final score is calculated and printed correctly.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` should update the position based on the direction, but it currently does not do so. This could lead to incorrect movement of entities on the field.
   - The main logic for handling movements and actions is correct, assuming `func_1` works as intended.

Given that the main logic of the program is correct and the provided function `func_1` does not seem to be used within the main program (it is defined but not called), the overall correctness of the program is not affected by the function `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the main logic for handling the game steps. The function `func_1` is not used in the main program, so its incorrect implementation does not affect the overall correctness.
