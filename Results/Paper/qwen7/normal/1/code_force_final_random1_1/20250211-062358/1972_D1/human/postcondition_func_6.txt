The function reads input from the user, processes it to extract test cases, and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers \(n\) and \(m\) representing the parameters of each test case. The number of tuples in the list matches the value of \(t\), which indicates the total number of test cases, and \(t\) is constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\).
