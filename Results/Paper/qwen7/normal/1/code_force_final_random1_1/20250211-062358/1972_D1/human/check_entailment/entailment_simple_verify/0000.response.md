### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required functionality. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc., are utility functions for reading input from standard input, but none of them directly implement the logic to solve the given problem.
   - Functions like `func_13` and `func_14` deal with mathematical operations but are not relevant to the problem at hand.
   - Function `func_15` calculates a value related to the sum of integer divisions, but it does not address the core requirement of counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Core Logic Missing**:
   - The core logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and count the valid pairs is missing.
   - There is no function that iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition.

4. **Output**:
   - The program currently prints a series of numbers (likely unrelated to the problem) without implementing the required logic.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality to solve the given problem.
