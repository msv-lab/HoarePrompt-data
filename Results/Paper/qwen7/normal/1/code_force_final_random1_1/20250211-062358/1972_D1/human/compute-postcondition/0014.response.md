Output State: **The program returns the sum of 2 plus the integer division of (n + i) by (i * i) for each iteration from i = 2 to i = n + 1, minus 1.**

This means the program calculates the sum of 2 plus the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \((i * i)\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n + 1\), and then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning the final result.
