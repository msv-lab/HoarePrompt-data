Output State: **`tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `d[da]` is a list of integers (unchanged), `di` is the next element from `d[da]`, `processing[di - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `processing[di - 1]` from 1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
