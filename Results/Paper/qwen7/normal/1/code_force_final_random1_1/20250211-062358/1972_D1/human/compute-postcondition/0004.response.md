Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically an underscore indicating that the variable itself is not used within the loop body.
   - The loop condition is controlled by the function `func_10()`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer value.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The stdout writes a positive integer minus 1.

4. **Analyze the loop execution:**
   - Since `_` is not used in the loop body, the primary concern is the loop condition, which is controlled by `func_10()`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer value.

5. **Adjust the state:**
   - The state of `t` does not change directly within the loop since it is not used.
   - The state of `func_10()` needs to be considered. For the loop to continue, `func_10()` must return a positive integer value.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the return value of `func_10()`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the stdout writes a positive integer minus 1, and `func_10()` must return a positive integer value**.
