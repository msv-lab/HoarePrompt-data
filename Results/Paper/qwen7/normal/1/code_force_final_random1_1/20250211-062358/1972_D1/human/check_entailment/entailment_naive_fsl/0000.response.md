Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any logic to solve this problem. Instead, they include various utility functions that are not used in solving the given problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
