Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the stdout writes a positive integer minus 1.**

Explanation: The function `func_15()` returns a positive integer minus 1. The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output as a string. Since `func_15()` returns a positive integer minus 1, the output written to the standard output will be a string representing that value. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state.
