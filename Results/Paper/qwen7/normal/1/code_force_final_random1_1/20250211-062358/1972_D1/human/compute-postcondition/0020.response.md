Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, decreasing `k` by the difference between `m` and each element `a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0 after the iteration, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.**
