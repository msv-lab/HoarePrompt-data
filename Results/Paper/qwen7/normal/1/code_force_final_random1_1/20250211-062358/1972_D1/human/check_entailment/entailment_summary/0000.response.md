Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the functions collectively meet the problem description. Let's break down the problem and the provided functions:

### Problem Description:
- We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
- The core logic for solving the problem is implemented in `func_15`.
- `func_16` is responsible for reading input and writing output for multiple test cases.
- Other functions like `func_3`, `func_4`, etc., are utility functions to handle input and output.

### Analysis of `func_15`:
- `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
- The logic inside `func_15` does not directly solve the problem but seems to be a placeholder or incorrect implementation for the given problem.

### Analysis of `func_16`:
- `func_16` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_15`.
- However, the output of `func_15` does not seem to match the expected output format, as it should be the count of valid pairs for each test case, not a series of numbers minus 1.

### Conclusion:
- The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_15` does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The function `func_16` incorrectly processes the output of `func_15`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
