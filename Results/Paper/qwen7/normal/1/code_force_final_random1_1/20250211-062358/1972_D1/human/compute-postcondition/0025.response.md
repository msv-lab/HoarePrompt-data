Output State: **`rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`, the `processing` list is reset to all 0s for each `di` in `d[da]`, and `d[da]` and `rank` lists remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value found during the loop iterations. The `processing` list is reset to 0 for each `di` in `d[da]`, meaning all its elements are set to 0. The `d[da]` list and `rank` list remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
