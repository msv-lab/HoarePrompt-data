The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b` is greater than 0. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it either directly returns `(1, 0, a)` when `b` is 0, or it recursively computes and returns values related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, specifically `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is defined by the return values, which represent coefficients and a greatest common divisor.
