Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `func_15()` returns a positive integer.

### Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `func_10()` times.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop uses `_` (an underscore) as the loop variable, which typically indicates that the value of the loop variable is not used within the loop body. However, the loop still depends on `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Number of Iterations**: The number of iterations is determined by `func_10()`.
2. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer, and we need to account for the fact that the loop will run one more time based on the return value of `func_10()`.

Since the loop runs for `func_10()` times, and we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not used in the loop.
- The value of `func_10()` will decrease by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.

### Final State
At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` returned a positive integer, say `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return `k - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `func_10()` returns `k - 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the previous iteration, we can represent it generically.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `func_10()` returns a positive integer minus 1**.
