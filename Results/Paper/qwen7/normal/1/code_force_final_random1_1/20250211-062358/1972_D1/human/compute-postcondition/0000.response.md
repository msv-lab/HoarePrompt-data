Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`.
   - The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not carry any specific name, but it still represents a loop iteration.
   - The function `func_10()` returns an integer value that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and the sum of `n` or `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer (since the loop runs from 0 to `func_10() - 1`).

Given these points, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Since the exact behavior of `func_10()` is not specified, we assume it returns a positive integer within a reasonable range. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to set up the initial state such that `func_10()` indeed returns a positive integer.

Since the exact value returned by `func_10()` is not known, we can only ensure that it returns a positive integer. Therefore, the state should reflect this condition.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Thus, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `func_10()` must return a positive integer**.
