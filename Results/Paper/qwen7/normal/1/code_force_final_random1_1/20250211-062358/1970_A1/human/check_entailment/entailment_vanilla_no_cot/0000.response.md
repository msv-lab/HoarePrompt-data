Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Class `BalanceInfo` Missing**: The code references `BalanceInfo` but does not define it. The `BalanceInfo` class should store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the input string.

2. **Incorrect Sorting Key**: The sorting key used in `func_2` is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the columns should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance and then in decreasing order of position in case of a tie. However, the current implementation sorts in the opposite way (decreasing balance and increasing position).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    
    # Sort in increasing order of balance and decreasing order of position
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)

# Example usage
func_2("(()(()))")
```

This corrected version defines the `BalanceInfo` class and sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects correctly according to the specified criteria.
