Output State: **`balance_info` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `BalanceInfo` objects. The first element's `balance` is 2 if `s[2]` is '(', otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`. `i` is 3. `balance` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `balance` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so `balance` was either 2 (if `s[2]` is '(') or -1 (if `s[2]` is ')'). After incrementing `balance` by 1, its value becomes 3 if `s[2]` is '(', or 0 if `s[2]` is ')'. Also, `i` is updated to 3 because the increment operation does not affect `i`.
