You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the original length of the string `s`, and `balance` is the net balance of the parentheses in the string `s` (i.e., the difference between the number of '(' and ')'). The `balance_info` list contains `n` elements, each being a `BalanceInfo` object where the `balance` attribute reflects the balance at each step `i` during the loop, and `i` is the index at which the balance was recorded. If `s[i]` is '(', the `balance` attribute increases by 1, and if `s[i]` is ')', the `balance` attribute decreases by 1.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the concatenation of the `character` attributes of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list, sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order and by the negative of the `position` attribute in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", and returns `True` if `s` is a valid balanced parentheses sequence, otherwise it returns `False`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
