Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the sorting of the `balance_info` list properly. The sorting key should ensure that the balance is sorted in ascending order and in case of a tie, the positions are sorted in descending order. However, the current implementation sorts the positions in ascending order instead of descending order.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
(()(()))
```

Expected output:
```
()(()())
```

However, due to the incorrect sorting key, the program might produce an incorrect output. For instance, the sorting key should be:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```

But the current implementation uses:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```

This results in the positions being sorted in ascending order instead of descending order, leading to an incorrect shuffle.

To fix this, the sorting key should be:
```python
balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
```

By correcting the sorting key, the program will correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation.
