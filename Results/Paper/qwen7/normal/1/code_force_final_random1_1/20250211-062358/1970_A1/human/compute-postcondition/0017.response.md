Postcondition: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")"; `n` must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `BalanceInfo` objects. If `s[2]` is '(', the first element's `balance` is 2, otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`. `i` is 3, and `balance` is 1. If `s[2]` is not '(', the first element's `balance` is 1, otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`, `i` is 2, and `balance` is decreased by 1.
