The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing the result along with "AM" or "PM". It reads the number of test cases from the user, then for each test case, it takes an input string `s`, extracts the hour part, and prints the corresponding 12-hour format time followed by "AM" or "PM". The function does not return any value; it only prints the converted times.
