You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    09:41
    
    18:06

    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing the result along with "AM" or "PM". It reads the number of test cases from the user, then for each test case, it takes an input string `s`, extracts the hour part, and prints the corresponding 12-hour format time followed by "AM" or "PM". The function does not return any value; it only prints the converted times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For `h == '00'`, it correctly prints `12`.
   - For `h` between `'01'` and `'12'`, it prints `h` directly.
   - For `h` between `'13'` and `'23'`, it calculates the 12-hour equivalent by subtracting 12 and prepends a zero if necessary (`'0{}'`).
3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`, it appends `'PM'`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `'AM'`.

However, there are a few issues in the code that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Output Formatting**: The program uses `print` without specifying the separator, which can lead to unexpected outputs. It should use `print` with a space separator.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle leading zeros for hours properly. For example, `'01'` should be printed as `'01'` instead of `'1'`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end=' ')
        elif h == '12':
            print('12', end=' ')
        else:
            print('0' + str(int(h) - 12) if int(h) > 12 else h, end=' ')
        print(s[2:] + ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Correctness:
After addressing the issues mentioned above, the program should work correctly according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
