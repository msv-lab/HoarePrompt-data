Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value. However, since no specific previous value is mentioned, we can assume `t` is simply an integer, but its exact value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `s` is a new string input by the user. The value of `s` is unknown until the user inputs it.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('12', end='')
```

This statement will print the string `'12'` followed by the `end=''` parameter, which means no newline character will be added after the printed string.

Output: **12**
