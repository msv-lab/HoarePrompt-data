Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` correctly processes the input for each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the time in the format "hh:mm".
- It then checks the hour part (`h`) to determine whether to print "AM" or "PM".
- If the hour is "00", it correctly prints "12" instead of "00".
- If the hour is between "01" and "12", it prints the hour as is.
- If the hour is between "13" and "23", it correctly converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero if necessary.
- Finally, it appends "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to "12".

Given the logic and the provided example, the function appears to handle all edge cases and produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
