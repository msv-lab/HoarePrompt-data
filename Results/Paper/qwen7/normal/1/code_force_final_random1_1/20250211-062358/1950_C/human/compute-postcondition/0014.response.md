Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the string input by the user, `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` is '00', then the postcondition remains as the precondition. If `h` is not '00', then `h` represents a valid time hour (i.e., `int(h)` is between 01 and 12 inclusive), and the postcondition remains as the precondition.
