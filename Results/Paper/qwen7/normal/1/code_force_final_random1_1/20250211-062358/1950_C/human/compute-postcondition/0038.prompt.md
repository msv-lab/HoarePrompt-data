Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the string input by the user, `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` is '00', then the postcondition remains as the precondition. If `h` is not '00', then `h` represents a valid time hour (i.e., `int(h)` is between 01 and 12 inclusive), and the postcondition remains as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, and `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` is '00', no changes are made to `t` and `s`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` and `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer that is 1 more than its previous value, `s` is a new string input by the user, and `h` is the first two characters of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
