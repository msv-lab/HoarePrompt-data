Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `d2` and `d1` remain unchanged, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1.**

This means that the value of `d2[i]` has been updated according to the formula `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The other variables (`d2`, `d1`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
