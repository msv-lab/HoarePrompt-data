Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the formula `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is set to `k - 1` from the initial state, and the value of `d2[i]` is now determined by the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
