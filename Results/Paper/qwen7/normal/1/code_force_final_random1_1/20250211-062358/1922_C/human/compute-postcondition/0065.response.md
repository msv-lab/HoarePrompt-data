Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though this value does not affect the print statement).
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

From the initial state, we do not have explicit values for `d2[x]` and `d2[y]`. Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of these values.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
