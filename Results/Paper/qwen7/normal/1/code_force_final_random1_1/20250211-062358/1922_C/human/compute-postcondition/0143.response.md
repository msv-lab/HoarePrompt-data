Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is 1 and continue until `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be 1 (the first iteration) and `n` should be greater than 1 (so that `i < n - 1` holds true).

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `m - 1`.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `k`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `k`, it needs to be adjusted to 1.
   - `n` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
