Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `j` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` and `y` are both converted from input strings to integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is a dictionary, and `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` refer to the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Since the values of `x` and `y` are explicitly stated to be input integers, and no other information about `d2` is provided, the output will depend on the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the value at key `y` and the value at key `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
