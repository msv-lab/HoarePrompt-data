Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` down to `1` (since `range` in Python is exclusive of the stop value). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - We know that `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
   - All keys in `d1` are from `i + 2` up to `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Determine the initial value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

5. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n - 2`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` should be set to `n - 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

Given these points, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 2**.
