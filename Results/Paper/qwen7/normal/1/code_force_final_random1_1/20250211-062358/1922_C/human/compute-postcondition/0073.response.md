Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted by the user, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers inputted by the user split by spaces, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new defaultdict `d2` with an integer default factory. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `l`, `d1`). Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
