Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `d2` and `d1` remain unchanged.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements to `1`.
- The loop updates `d2[i]` based on the conditions provided.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - Initially, `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1 from its initial value.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop as it is not modified in the loop body.

3. **Variables `d1` and `d2`:**
   - These variables remain unchanged within the loop as they are not modified in the loop body.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `i` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1` from its previous value.
- `n` and the values of `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `i - 1` from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

Given that `i` started from `n-2` and decremented to `1`, if `i` was previously `2`, it will now be `1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`d2` and `d1` remain unchanged, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1**.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
```
State: **`d2` and `d1` remain unchanged, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1**
```
