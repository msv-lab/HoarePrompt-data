Output State: The final state of the loop will be such that for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `d2[i]` will be the maximum value of `1 + d2[j]` or `l[j] - l[j-1] + d2[j]` for all `j` from `i+1` to `n-1`, based on the condition `l[j+1] - l[j] < l[j] - l[j-1]`. If no such `j` exists, `d2[i]` will be the cumulative sum of differences `l[j] - l[j-1]` from `i+1` to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, `d2[i]` will store the maximum value obtained by either incrementing the value of `d2[i+1]` by 1 or adding the difference between consecutive elements of `l` starting from `i+1` until `n-1`, but only if the condition `l[j+1] - l[j] < l[j] - l[j-1]` is met at any point. If the condition is never met, `d2[i]` will simply be the sum of differences from `i+1` to `n-1`.

The variable `d1[n+1]` will be the sum of `d1[2]` (which is 1) and the number of times the condition `l[i+1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i-1]` is true for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i+1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold.
