Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j < m`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then no changes are made to `m` and `j`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0`, after the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j = 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as no changes are made to it within the loop body.
   - The values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `m` must still be greater than 0.
- `j` is now 1.
- `x` is still the input integer.
- `y` is still the input integer.

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.
