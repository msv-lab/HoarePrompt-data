Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is either 2 or 4.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-1`, if `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - If `i` is currently 4, the loop would have already finished because the condition `i < n` would no longer hold true (since `n` is greater than 4).

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - If `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - If `i` was 4, the loop would have already completed, and there would be no further iterations.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.
- If `i` was 4, the loop would have already completed, and there would be no further adjustments needed for `i` or `n`.

Since the problem asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, and considering the loop condition, the most relevant scenario is when `i` is 2 and moves to 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
