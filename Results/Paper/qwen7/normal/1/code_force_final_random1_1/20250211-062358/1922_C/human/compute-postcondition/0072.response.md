Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted by the user, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers inputted by the user split by spaces, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with an integer default factory. This means that `d1` is a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically be assigned an integer value (0 by default). None of the existing variables (`m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `l`) are affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
