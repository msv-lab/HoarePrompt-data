Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - The value of `d1[i + 2]` is determined based on the condition involving `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and `l[i] - l[i - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will now be 2 and the loop runs up to `n-1`).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` will be 2.

6. **Consider the value of `d1[i + 2]`**:
   - Since `i` will be 2, `i + 2` will be 4.
   - The value of `d1[4]` will depend on the same condition as before but with updated indices.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**.
