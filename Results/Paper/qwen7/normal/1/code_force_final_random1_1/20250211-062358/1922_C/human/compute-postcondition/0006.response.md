Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1` inclusive.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `1`.

4. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. If `n` is less than or equal to `1`, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `i` is `1` and `n` is greater than `1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
