Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `2`, `d1[n + 1]` is the sum of `d1[2]` (which is 1) and the number of times the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i + 1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold. The current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `d2[i]` becomes `1 + d2[n - 1]`, which is `1 + 1` since `d2[n - 1]` is initially `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
