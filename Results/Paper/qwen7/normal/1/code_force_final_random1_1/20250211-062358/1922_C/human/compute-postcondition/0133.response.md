Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

However, there is no information about the dictionary `d1` or the values it contains. Since `d1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`. Therefore, we can only describe the expression being printed.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
