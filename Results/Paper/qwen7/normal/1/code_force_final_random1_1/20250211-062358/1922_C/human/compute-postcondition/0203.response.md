Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `m` will hold the total number of test cases, `j` will be equal to `m-1` (since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration), and `x` and `y` will be the values of the last pair of integers provided by the user during the last test case. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**

This means that:
- `m` reflects the total number of test cases processed.
- `j` is `m-1` because it increments after each iteration.
- `x` and `y` are the values of the last pair of integers inputted by the user.
- `d1` and `d2` remain unaltered as they are not updated within the loop body.
