Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each `i` from `n-2` to `1`; `d1` remains unchanged; `n` is at least 3; `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements to `1`; `(l[i] - l[i - 1]) is greater than or equal to (l[i + 1] - l[i])` for each relevant `i`.**

This means that for each `i` starting from `n-2` and decrementing to `1`, the value of `d2[i]` is updated to the sum of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` and the previous value of `d2[i + 1]`. The other conditions and variables remain as they were initially.
