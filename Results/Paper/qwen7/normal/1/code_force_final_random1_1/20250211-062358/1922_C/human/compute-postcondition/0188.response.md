Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though `m` is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is 0 (though `j` is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

The print statement is `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

Here, `d2` is a list or a dictionary where the indices or keys correspond to the values of `x` and `y`. Since the actual content of `d2` is not specified, we can only describe the operation based on the given conditions.

Given that `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will subtract the value at index `x` from the value at index `y` in `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]** (where `y` is an input integer less than or equal to `x`)
