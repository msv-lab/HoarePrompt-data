Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the list `l` has at least three elements such that if the difference between the second and first element of `l` is less than the difference between the first and the second-to-first element of `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
