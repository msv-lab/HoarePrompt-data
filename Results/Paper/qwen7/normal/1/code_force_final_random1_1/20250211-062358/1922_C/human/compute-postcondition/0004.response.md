Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `int`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, or `d1`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `d2` being added as a new variable with its default settings.
