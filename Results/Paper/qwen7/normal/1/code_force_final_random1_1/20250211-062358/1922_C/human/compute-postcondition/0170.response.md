Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 2, and `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.
