Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`; `l` has at least three elements.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` with the key `i + 2` (which is 6) and assigns it the value of `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is 4, so `i + 1` is 5 and `i + 2` is 6. The values of `n` and the list `l` remain unchanged from the initial state.
