Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 2, and the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The other conditions and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
