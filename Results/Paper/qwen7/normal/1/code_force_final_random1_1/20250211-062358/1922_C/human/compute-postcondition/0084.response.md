Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 4, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` by setting the key `i + 2` (which is `2 + 2 = 4`) to the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`). The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
