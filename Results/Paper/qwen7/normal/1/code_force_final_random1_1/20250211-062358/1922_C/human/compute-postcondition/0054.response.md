Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

From the initial state, there is no explicit value given for `d2`, so we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. However, we can describe the expression based on the given conditions.

The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will subtract the value of `d2` at index `y` from the value of `d2` at index `x`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
