Output State: **`d2[n - 1]` is 1, and all keys in `d1` are from `i + 2` up to `n + 1` (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code snippet `d2[n - 1] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `n - 1` in the dictionary `d2`. This operation does not affect the dictionary `d1`, which contains keys from `i + 2` up to `n + 1` (inclusive) as per the initial state. Therefore, the state of `d1` remains unchanged, and only `d2[n - 1]` is updated to 1.
