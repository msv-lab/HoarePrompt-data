Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - The list `l` has at least three elements.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `range(1, n - 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition `n > 4` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4.

5. **List `l` remains unchanged** as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and the list `l` has at least three elements**.
