Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, and the list `l` has at least three elements; `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is `3 + 2` or `5`) is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`). The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
