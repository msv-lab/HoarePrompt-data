Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the integer `m`.
2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be 0 (the starting point) and `m` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `j` and `m`.

3. **Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` being 0, we need to set `j` to 0.
4. **Initial State of `m`**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to 0 and `m` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
