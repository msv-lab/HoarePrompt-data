Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` down to `1` (since the upper limit is `0`, the loop will not run if `n <= 2`). 

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` will take values from `n-2` down to `1`.
   - The variable `n` must be at least `3` for the loop to execute because the loop starts at `n-2` and goes down to `1`.

4. **Consider the given state**:
   - `d2[n - 1]` is set to `1`.
   - `d1` remains unchanged from its initial state.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n` being at least `3`, we need to ensure `n` is at least `3`.
   - The value of `d2[n - 1]` being `1` is already part of the initial state and does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `n` is at least `3` and `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements to `1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d2[n - 1]` is set to 1, `d1` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements to `1`**.
