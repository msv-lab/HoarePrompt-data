Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is `i`, which is initialized by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is initialized by `int(input())`, the value of `i` will be whatever the user inputs. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given constraints.

3. **Constraints on `i`**: The problem states that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `i` (which is equal to `t`) must be within this range for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` is within the specified range for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to set `i` to a value that satisfies \(1 \leq i \leq 10^4\).

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
**`i` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 10^4\)**
