Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted by the user, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers inputted by the user split by spaces.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing them in the list `l`. The initial conditions for `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
