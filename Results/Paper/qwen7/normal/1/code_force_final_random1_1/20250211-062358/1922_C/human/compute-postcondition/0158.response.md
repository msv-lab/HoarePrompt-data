Postcondition: `d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions provided. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is set to 1 + `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is calculated as `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.
