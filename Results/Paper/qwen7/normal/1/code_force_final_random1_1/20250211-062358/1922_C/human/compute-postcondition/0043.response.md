Output State: **`d2` remains unchanged, `d1` remains unchanged, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code attempts to assign `1 + d2[i + 1]` to `d2[i]`. However, since `i` is 0 and the length of `d2` is not specified, it's impossible to determine the exact value of `d2[i + 1]` without knowing the length of `d2`. Given the precondition that `n` is at least 3, we cannot infer the value of `d2[1]` from the given information. Therefore, the assignment cannot be completed, and the values of `d2`, `d1`, and `i` remain unchanged.
