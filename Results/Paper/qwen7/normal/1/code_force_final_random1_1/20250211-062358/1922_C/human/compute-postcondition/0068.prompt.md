Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is an input integer, `d1` remains unchanged, and `d2` is populated based on the conditions inside the loop from `i = n-2` to `i = 0`, with `d2[0]` being the sum of `l[0] - l[-1]` plus the value of `d2[1]` from the previous iteration.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If the current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`, then no changes are made to `m` and `j`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then no changes are made to `m` and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are input integers, both converted from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, no changes are made to `m` and `j`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `m` and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
