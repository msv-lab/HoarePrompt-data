Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though `m` is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer, and its value is greater than the value of `x`.

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

Since `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`. However, we know that `y` is greater than `x`, so `d1[y]` will be accessed after `d1[x]`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the value of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
